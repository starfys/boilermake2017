INSPIRATION we wanted to create a simple ios application which allows small businesses and startups to be funded with a swipe on the screen WHAT_IT_DOES it presents startups and businesses to investors and helps them invest their money for the best idea by just swiping on the screen. HOW_WE_BUILT_IT we used swift 3 and xcode to develop the application. git hub for the version control of the app and parser for back-end of the software. CHALLENGES_WE_RAN_INTO team management was a big drawback when came to implementing the project. the facebook login did not work at all and we lost couple of our team members. the setting up of the systems delayed us(damn you xcode and no compatibility with linux!) ACCOMPLISHMENTS swift was a new language for all of us. it was fun to have a go with it and try to impact on something with our recently gained knowledge. creating a shell for the application was a good accomplishment. WHAT_WE_LEARNED time management is very important factor in short duration challenges. spending more than an hour stuck on the same thing is devastating for your project development. WHATS_NEXT_FOR investr investr has a promising future if we spend time updating and upgrading our initial product. it is missing features like paypal linking and transfer but given more time it could be implemented. after all, this is an idea developed for only 24 hours!
