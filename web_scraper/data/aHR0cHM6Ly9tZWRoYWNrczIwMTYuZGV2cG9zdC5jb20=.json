Some of us are far from home or from friends for long periods, so we want someone to check up on how we\u2019re feeling (astronauts). And all of us go through rough patches at some point in our lives, so it\u2019d be nice to have a friend who checks up on how we feel (psych patients).</p>\n<p>And all of these factors can eventually lead to people having a violent outburst or breakdown, and make us sick. We are convinced that emotional health is just important as, and in some ways even more than, physical health. The true remedy is network of people \u2013 friend and family who will check up on how we\u2019re feeling, but we that is a privilege that not all of us have and certainly not all the time. What if, technology could be this friend that understands how we feel?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>(Physiological mechanism) Whenever we think or feel, our neurons produce tiny electrical signals. And we can detect these signals just by placing some electrodes right onto the scalp. This is called electroencephalogram or EEG, and it paints us a picture of what is going on inside the brain. Because it\u2019s such a powerful tool, it\u2019s the gold standard in any neuro research from sleep studies to diagnosis of neurological diseases and coma state.</p>\n<p>The device we chose is the Muse Headband. It is a portable 7-lead EEG monitor that just comfortably slips on, fits all, and can be kept on for long times. And by processing the EEG that the Muse generates, we can understand \u2013 or at least generally categorize \u2013 what you\u2019re feeling. </p>\n<p>The EEG measures voltage fluctuations, which have different amplitudes and frequencies. They look specifically at the gamma band, a specific range of frequency (\u201cemotional evaluation\u201d).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>(Data Transfer) The real-time data from the Muse Headband is sent to the laptop over Bluetooth. We used Node JS to \u201cchunk\u201d the data into 30-second segments. </p>\n<p>(Signal Processing) We retrieve the EEG data from the Muse band, and extract the measurement of microvoltage measurements. The Muse SDK conducts band filtering on the dataset to remove extreme values and noises. Then, we conduct a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which gives us the amplitude and frequency of electrical signals at each data point. We average the amplitudes within the gamma wave frequency range, which results in a value called PSD (Power Spectral Density). We isolate the PSD values in the gamma band range.</p>\n<p>(Baseline Establishment) According to numerous peer-reviewed research articles, it has been found that high PSD is caused by generally unpleasant emotions (low valency), and low PSD is caused by generally positive emotions (high valency). Each person has slightly varying PSD values, so for each subject we need to establish a baseline. The emotions studied (happy, anger, confused, disgusted) were simulated by showing video clips. Future PSD values are categorized into positive and negative emotions using statistical analysis.</p>\n<p>(Server-client Model) After the signals are processed, the data is transferred to AWS EC2 Server. The server communicates with the client, which is the mobile app in this scenario. We created a Emicus.tech domain for our sponsor, .tech. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Among the challenges we ran into were the signal processing aspect. The Muse Headband actually has a lot more variables, including accelerometer data. Isolating what we needed specifically was an initial challenge. Another major challenge was interpreting the EEG data. However, we were able to find papers and MATLAB toolkits that allowed us to perform these complex calculations such as FFT and PSD easily.</p>\n<p>We were fortunate enough to be allowed to use the Muse Headband and Amazon Echo from MLH. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are particularly proud of our real-time monitoring function and our mobile application. The real-time monitoring had high accuracy in many subjects, often even before baseline testing. We are also proud of our mobile application (JavaScript) and the fluidity of the UI. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how physiological phenomena are extremely complex, yet there are incredible tools out there from hardware, functions and toolboxes that allow us to peek into the inner workings of human physiology.</p>\n<h2>What's next for EMICUS</h2>\n<p>In the immediate term (days), we want to make the Epicus much more accurate. We could use these datasets to drastically improve our accuracy and sensitivity by using machine learning. We found a few research labs that publicly share EEG data categorized by emotions. However, they required us to return a signed confidentiality form to gain access, which was not possible over the weekend in a limited timeframe. And as the headband is becomes more widespread, we would have access to more EEG data that is specifically generated from Muse.</p>\n<p>In the short term, we could improve our mobile app to introduce another stakeholder. For instance, in cases of autistic children or psychiatric patients, it would be important to also develop a monitoring application on the guardian or caregiver side via a secure pathway.</p>\n<p>Also, we could integrate this technology to a smart-home environment. Based on the mood of the user, the physical environment could adapt spontaneously (lighting, music, etc.). </p>\n<p>In the long term, we envision that EEG sensors will improve significantly. This will allow for a device that is very low profile that is even more user-friendly, and has a higher sensitivity and accuracy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://emicus.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://emicus.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>emicus.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["EEG data analysis & modeling\n", "Innovator of 'Emicus',\nFull-stack developer", "", "", ""]], ["ThereForYou", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ThereForYou \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/531/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Suicide is one of the leading causes of death around the world, yet there is an increasing stigma towards discussing how one is feeling. Psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, and counselors struggle to assist patients because they only see a fraction of their patients' true mentalities, many times a guarded version once a month at a meeting. With the rising cost of health care, more and more patients are not able to attend therapy frequently or do not feel comfortable because of the stigma attached to mental health. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ThereForYou is an iOS and web app that tracks patients' emotions on a daily basis through speech, tone, and facial expression analysis. After a user simply records their voice or a brief video explaining their day, ThereForYou detects notes of five different emotions: anxiety, disgust, fear, sadness, and joy, presenting the percentage of each detected. Each week, users can see a graph of their emotions from each day. On the web, doctors can log into the portal and access a wide array of information about how their patients are interacting with ThereForYou, how their emotions are doing, and quickly identify patients who are having particularly rough times. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The iOS app is built using Swift 3.0, utilizing Apple's Speech Kit to collect a user's inputted words, the IBM Watson API to analyze the various emotional tones in the input, and Microsoft's Cognitive Services Emotional Analysis API to analyze facial expressions and micro-expressions. Combing these inputs, an algorithm reaches a conclusion about the percentage of each emotion. The iOS app calls a backend through Alamofire written in Node.js on AWS to access IBM Watson and Microsoft Cognitive Services and return only the necessary information to the app. The web app is built in Ruby on Rails for a clean interface for doctors to access exactly what they need to know.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The largest challenge we had was getting all of the independent APIs and services to come together into one cohesive, sensical project. We each took on a specific aspect, realizing halfway through that we had no way to connect all of them. Through the backend on AWS, we were able to merge all of the information we had collected and return a result to the app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The facial recognition, especially micro-expressions, were incredibly hard to implement, and we wanted a way to make users feel comfortable with what we were asking of them. By including an emoji that reflects how the app sees the person's emotions, users feel more comfortable using the app. Further, the information through the facial expression recognition software is incredibly beneficial for doctors and patients alike. We all feel incredibly proud knowing that we made an app that will positively impact not only our lives, but those around us and widespread throughout the world. Mental health has been neglected for long enough; ThereForYou simply and effectively allows users to track their emotions without stigma and provides that information to doctors.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Oh, so much. One of us learned Node.js and built the IBM Watson portion of the backend in a few hours, another spent the entirety of the weekend on the facial expression recognition, getting it to work a mere two hours ago with the help of the whole team, while another one of us focused on connecting the frontend to the backend. We shared our knowledge on various languages, frameworks, and skills. We also met each other for the first time on Friday, which was definitely a plus too!</p>\n<h2>What's next for ThereForYou</h2>\n<p>Onto the App Store! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/oliviabrown9/MedHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/oliviabrown9/MedHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was the front-end engineer, developing the iOS app (Swift), the voice-to-text, and graph making.", "I worked on the ROR websites, the backend (Node.js) and the data analysis ( IBM watson, face recognition and data analysis),ios app \n", "I worked on the backend with Node.js, I used IBM watson for analysing the tone/text and I made a prototype of the dashboard using Ruby on Rails."]], ["Sketchmagik", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>According to the CDC, about 10,000 babies born in the U.S. will develop cerebral palsy each year, the most common motor disability in childhood. Although CP is the most common condition that leads to this problem, it is not the only one. Problems with motor skills may also arise from traumatic brain injuries, autism, and Down syndrome. Issues with fine motor skills are early signs of Parkinson\u2019s disease and ALS syndrome. </p>\n<p>Functional movement disorders also include conditions that are not seen as severe, such as tremors, spasms, or twitches. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sketchmagik is a fun and interactive android application that is designed for children. It not only serves as therapy, but it sends data to the physician or therapist treating the patient. Sketchmagik tests for both motor and cognitive development. </p>\n<p>The app starts off by showing a tutorial: there is a dotted square, and the goal is to trace it as best as you can. There are numbered dots around the shape\u2014the user is supposed to follow those in order. Sketchmagik introduces the user to simple images, and while the user traces those images, Sketchmagik is collecting data on deviation, elapsed time, and attempts it took for the user to get the image correct. </p>\n<p>This data is sent to a dashboard that the doctor/therapist can analyze. This data can be applied in many ways. For starters, a pediatrician can see if a child is developing the skills that are appropriate for their age range. If a child is falling behind on either motor or cognitive skills, the data can serve as a diagnostic tool, influencing the doctor to take a closer look at the patient. </p>\n<p>For patients with disabilities, Sketchmagik can be used to measure their improvement as they\u2019re being treated by either physical therapy or drug therapy. Sketchmagik exercises fine motor and cognitive skills, while reporting accurate data to a physician. Currently, we have parents or medical professionals dictate how \u201coff\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d a child is performing in an activity, but Sketchmagik is meant to give statistics that won\u2019t be biased or misinterpreted. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Sketchmagik</h2>\n<p>Currently, Sketchmagik has very simple images for the user to trace, but in the future, more complex images/instructions can be integrated to keep testing the patient in different ways. For example, instructing the user to write their name or draw a picture without using tracing lines could further test cognitive/motor development. Are they capable of following those instructions, and how legible is their final product? </p>\n<p>We believe that Sketchmagik can be modified to more specific populations, as well\u2014games could also test for different things, such as memory. This would allow Sketchmagik to serve as a diagnostic tool to detect early signs for other conditions, such as Alzheimer\u2019s. Sketchmagik\u2019s simplicity and accessibility make it a great non-invasive diagnostic tool that can be used anywhere. A patient doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be in a lab or have blood tests performed for detection of conditions. Sketchmagik can take care of that, so we\u2019d like for the uses for it to be as universal as possible for patients with motor/neurological disorders. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I assisted in developing the path deviation algorithm and also helped setup the database for this android application.", "Developed the Android application with team members to collect user's sketch data and send to server.

Basic necessities like medical care are sparse.*\"</h1>\n<hr/>\n<h3>What was the inspiration?</h3>\n<p>As two students from Turkey, we've witnessed the Syrian Refugee crisis more up close than most in the world. We've seen so many people who all had careers and futures ahead of them, suffer on the streets of our home. We were heartbroken as we realized that they had to leave it all behind because of circumstances they could not control and there wasn't a solution we could find at the time that would be a permanent one to any of their problems. To this day, those problems remain, and healthcare is the most alarming. </p>\n<p>At MedHacks, we realized that NOW was our chance to help. </p>\n<h5><em>This is for all the souls who were lost in this ongoing battle of mankind versus evil. May they rest in peace, and may others be spared in the crossfire.</em></h5>\n<hr/>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>This program creates an interface in which Doctors/Camp Leaders of Syrian refugee camps can list orders (when supplied with the Amazon.com URL, tracks the product down on the Amazon search results, and returns its name and price to be added to the list). It then builds a catalog of vital medication for the refugees, and encourages contributers to donate, raising the funds to cover the costs. The program itself has an algorithm which prioritizes drugs according to demand and creates a list that is sorted according to demand.  </p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>How was it built?</h3>\n<p>After hours of hard work, it was built in a joint effort mostly on Restful, Java and Javascript. While one of us coded, the other did the web development part, and we switched roles several times.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>A path full of obstacles...</h3>\n<p>As neither one of us had much experience in web development, we struggled with it the most, but also treated this situation as an opportunity to learn. We also did not know how we could incorporate the Amazon.com search funtion into our program and we learned how to do it from scratch during the hackathon. </p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>What have we accomplished?</h3>\n<p>Now, our program is able to create the list of medications that the doctors build By the use of our algorithms, it also prioritizes between the drug orders and distributes the funds collected from the contributors to cover the costs. </p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>What have we learned?</h3>\n<p>We have learned a lot about web developing/design and APIs in this project.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>What's next for PharmaFund?</h3>\n<p>Hopefully, as the refugee crisis is a very serious and critical subject matter, we would like to make this website a reality, in the hopes that it will at least change something for all the people that were not only forced to flee their own homes, but now are left in poverty. </p>\n<hr/>\n<p>*<em><em>(Source: <a href=\"https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/iraq-jordan-lebanon-syria-turkey/quick-facts-what-you-need-know-about-syria-crisis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.mercycorps.org/articles/iraq-jordan-lebanon-syria-turkey/quick-facts-what-you-need-know-about-syria-crisis</a>)</em></em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-product-advertising\">amazon-product-advertising</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">restful-web-services</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://pharmafund.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pharmafund.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pharmafund.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["We both worked on the code, implementation and web development.", "Spark Java, Javascript, Jquery, Git, Heroku, REST"]], ["#LegDay", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"#LegDay \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/414/643/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"#LegDay \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/559/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Science</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"#LegDay \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/560/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Upright</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"#LegDay \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/561/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Leg Calculations</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"#LegDay \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/562/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pride</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>The Start</h2>\n<p>For people who want to restore their mobility, there are currently few viable options to take. A Prosthetic of any degree are hard to make and assign to the individual patient. Any motorized version of such is extremely expensive. However, for people who are wheelchair bound, have spinal malformations or MS might find solace with an exoskeleton...</p>\n<p>But one caveat, they cost $40,000</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>With 2 Pis and an Arduino, linear actuators, a 3d printed frame and great software - the LegDay allows to be users to begin an assisted walking sequence for about $300 in materials. Using precalucated frames and tailors to the prototype actuators, when connected to a sensor chip, LegDay is able to respond to it's inputs.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We designed the leg in a 2 day marathon, then began the sprint to print the leg which took about 3 days of printing. Then once at the hackathon, we assembled the leg to the custom brackets and supports we have designed. </p>\n<p>The actuators handle a 12V rail for charge and can support about 1500 pounds of lift. (The frame cannot however.) With a Arduino Mega and a Seeed Motor Shield we reverse the polarities of the current digitally to control forward and backward motion. Then slaved to a Pi, we have software written in Erlang and Python that match the bio-mechanically correct calculations of leg motion matched to the person it was measured for. </p>\n<p>Once everything was wired up, custom communication protocols had to be made as well as software that allows generation of walking keyframes. Kinda cool we think.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We realized that we didn't bring enough parts, so around a total of 4 trips to the hardware/DIY Maker store were made along with the help of MLH's hardware. There were a points were we thought this wasn't possible. We also had to prototype without breadboarding as the amperage would fry everything so a long while we were flying by. Also, the team members had no almost experience designing legs or any medical device at all whatsoever.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We built it and it works.</p>\n<h2>What's next for LegDay</h2>\n<p>This is too cool to not be put out into market. We hope this can be on the legs of people who need it most with the help of the university and the health tech community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">erlang</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thecodethinker/PurpleLegMachine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/thecodethinker/PurpleLegMachine\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["Neurodo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Existing mental health apps often ask patients to rate the severity of their current issues or to self-apply cognitive behavioral techniques. However, patients with schizophrenia usually have difficulties with insight.</p>\n<p>Natural language processing techniques have been used in the past to diagnose schizophrenia or predict the onset of psychosis in at-risk populations. In these papers, conversations with a practitioner are manually transcribed and serve as a single data point to predict current and future mental health. </p>\n<p>These techniques work because thought-disordered speech has many common characteristics such as a unique approach to linkage (for example, connecting ideas based on their sounds or rhyming rather than topic as in clanging or omitting linkages like \"That reminds me of ...\").</p>\n<p>With the advent of widespread computer and smartphone use even among low-income populations, we now have access to immediately analyzable textual data. Endeavors that used to require hundreds of hours of manual transcription, parsing, and analysis can be accomplished in an instant with modern NLP techniques and hardware. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web app allows patients with thought disorders such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder to track improvements to cognitive dysfunction and delusions over time, so that they can assess the efficacy of different medications and therapy techniques.</p>\n<p>A patient can journal directly on the website or transfer their writings from another source such as a Word document or blog. Our backend analyzes the text by applying LSA to study semantic coherence and delusional content and traditional NLP parsing to study syntactic complexity.

Our data analysis is best supported by textual entries of a paragraph or more, but much of the historical data is transcribed speech and much of the current easily accessible data is in the form of short snippets on platforms like Twitter.</p>\n<p>Partnering with a hospital or research university would allow access to transcribed patient-practitioner archives which we couldn't get access to during the Hackathon, at once providing well-controlled data to further strengthen our models and allowing us to analyze the similarities and contrasts of thought disorders' impact on speech and writing. We will also exciting preliminary research on the analysis of abbreviated social media like Twitter. </p>\n<p>We envision providing a highly ethical and useful service, and to do so we must struggle with contradictions. We want to provide practical and perhaps life-saving insight, but we'd hate to make patients feel even more surveilled or controlled in their private lives and thoughts. The service must remain as a collaborative tool between doctors and patients rather than a frightening test.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of applying mathematical models from research papers to determine the incoherence of texts with three indices, the syntactical complexity, semantic coherence and delusional index. We were able to integrate the results of these three methods into a user-friendly website where a doctor or patient could conveniently upload passages and texts to gain insight on his/her condition. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Throughout the project we learned how to apply natural language processing techniques to extract important features from raw text data using tools such as the gensim python library, NLTK, ConceptNet5. Using the data, we were able to apply machine learning techniques to make predictions about syntactic complexity, semantic coherence, and delusional index. We learned to present the results through a website developed using Flask and Amazon EC2 hosting.

In the recent ebola outbreak, we saw a number of health care facilities shut down as staff were evacuated, which created a secondary and potentially more damaging issue. The communications network is critical to providing us with a way to track and identify community need to better determine the most effective allocation of resources. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>World globalization and the increasing threats of globalization led to R.E.S., our Regional Epidemiology System. By connecting people to providers, we hope to lead two initiatives: Aid and detection. These are accomplished through our five core goals, which include community integration, data streamlining, global connectivity, technological innovation, and connectivity and mobilization. \nR.E.S. begins with a community focus \u2014 starting here in the heart of Baltimore. Due to the increasing disparity between high and low income families, dramatic need allows us to tailor R.E.S. as a pilot program for improving community health. By combining the core strengths of two APIs, Twilio and SickWeather, R.E.S. has the capability to link community provided data about health to develop a threat level index for a specific area. Through further awareness and transparency, the advanced, integrated cellular AI can give patients further information on the threat level index, potential epidemics, local alerts, and proximal solutions. Our goal is that useage of a cellular network will allow us to connect the two populations who are most likely to be affected in epidemics: Low-income families and the elderly. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>R.E.S. was built through a creative combination of APIs, JavaScript, and HTML. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Part of the difficulty in developing a system for monitoring epidemics is the differences in communities around the globe. We started here in Baltimore because it provides us with a unique platform for both first-world and third-world countries, as reflected by the race and income discrepancies. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We want to engage people in global health development. Connecting communities to clinics will help us grow a network for epidemic prevention and health care response \u2014 and we believe that R.E.S. helps us do just that. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Epidemiology systems must be continuously updated to reflect the newest information and the hardest link will be making sure that providers can see and respond to need. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Regional Epidemiology System</h2>\n<p>Our goal is for R.E.S. to work for everyone, everywhere. After pilot testing in Baltimore, we hope to expand to communities around the globe, connecting with local NGOs, governments, and volunteers to mobilize and allocate resources and efficiently and effectively as possible. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sick-weather</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://dontpanicyet.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://dontpanicyet.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>dontpanicyet.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["HarassBlocker Plus", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by \"AdBlock Plus,\" a content filter for annoying advertisements; to create \"HarassBlocker Plus,\" our take on content filtering for harassment. This serves as an end-all solution to online harassment as the user will not be affected any longer. Social media was most frequently cited as the scene of online harassment, so this is where we decided to try our platform first. We believe this solution will greatly imporve ones mental health if they are experiencing harassment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We built this platform which can be easily expanded to other websites (or the entire web) to completely eliminate all forms of online harassment. As a use case, we added this platform to filter Facebook's Messenger. While a messaging session is active or loaded, we listen for new and existing messages and automatically filter out any ones deemed harassing. Online Chats are one of the most common places to find harassment, thus it was a great first example of our platform in use.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it on a chrome extension that can now be installed from the chrome app store. Currently, the chrome extension is looking for new or loaded messages on facebook and filtering them. When messages are loaded we pass them to our Node.js server and run IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer api on it. Tone Analyzer will give us a quick understanding of the overall message, this way we can tell the difference between a message intended to be a joke compared to one that is insulting. Using the metrics received from Watson we made our own neural net which does one more pass to fully determine if that message should be filtered out. Once we deem a message to be harassing we block that message from view. We have also added safeguards such as the ability to pause/disable the filtering with a button in the extension window which is the only other way to view the messages other than uninstalling the extension.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Currently this extension is only supporting content filtering on Facebook and one challenge would be expanding this platform to many/all websites a user visits. This is a matter of creating one algorithm for all websites or many different algorithms. The algorithms we use currently are fast enough to filter any chat messages without much delay but messenger is a small amount of content compared to other cases. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>With the ability to filter all harassing content from the web, this serves as the #1 platform for somebody experiencing harassment online. It can potentially save people from many of the side effects of being harassed.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We did a lot of research on online harassment and learned many things, here are a few things that we learned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>40% of internet users have personally experienced online harassment.</li>\n<li>Young adults are the most likely demographic group to experience harassment online. </li>\n<li>Men and women have different experiences with online harassment.</li>\n<li>Half of those harassed online do not know who is behind it.</li>\n<li>Social media was most frequently cited as the scene of online harassment.\n## What's next for HarassBlocker Plus\nWe would like to improve the machine learning to better detect harassment.

This data is represented in a movable and zoomable map page and data is constrained the state of Maryland.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This project is built around the R programming language, which was used to organize data sets, map out layers of data, and combine these two elements into visual interpretation of possible vectors for transmission of infectious agents. Demographics data was gathered from publicly available Census data and the SickWeather API data was called and parsed through Python. The files and source code are hosted through AWS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A major challenge we ran into was our inability to create a dynamic front-end client and back-end server to hold and represent our project. Given our collective lack of web development experience, we resorted to a static representation of data collected and analyzed. This is not significantly detrimental to the functionality of our project, since census data consists of reports from the last 5 years, and is not a rapidly changing data set. Data collected from the SickWeather API includes a couple weeks back of data, and relies on the aggregration of many individual markers. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SickHacks</h2>\n<p>The next step for this project would be to combine the information and layout displayed here with the released SickWeather App. Other considerations include increasing data input by exploring different sources of information, such as clinical data. </p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Special thanks to Erich Walker, Director of Information Technology at PPMS, who provided us with technical expertise and a familiarity with the SickWeather App.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sickweatherapi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://sickhacks.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sickhacks.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sickhacks.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sunnielyu/sickhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sunnielyu/sickhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sickhacks.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.sickhacks.org\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.sickhacks.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Gene Freq", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gene Freq \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/497/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our home page!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gene Freq \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/496/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Here is where you can sign up for a new account</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gene Freq \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/495/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Here is where you can sign into a pre-existing account</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gene Freq \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/494/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Here is where the user can enter their 'working directory', which contains all the sequencing files</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gene Freq \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/498/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>This is an example of a graph of the results</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Nasa is intending to send 4-6 people to Mars in the next 20 years. There is significant evidence to suggest that space travel exposes astronauts to radiation, which may cause mutations to develop in their genomes. For this reason, it is imperative to have a method for detecting 'dangerous' mutations while on Mars. More specifically, this method must be able to be used by a non-genomics specialist, and have easily interpretable results. </p>\n<p>After coming up with Gene Freq we realized this type of technology has a wide range of applications. As genome sequencing costs get lower and lower, sequencing whole genomes will become more and more popular. Thus, this platform can be utilized by healthcare professionals to screen high risk candidates (civilians with a significant amount of exposure to carcinogens such as radiation) for possible cancer mutations.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Ideally, the user would have a blood test before and after prolonged exposure to carcinogens. These blood samples would be sequenced, by a sequencing machine, and the outputs (fastq files) would be stored in a specified directory. \nAfter the user (i.e. the healthcare professional responsible for the given patient) signs in, they are able to specify the directory that holds the fastq files. Gene Freq then runs BWA mem (an open source software) to align reads to a reference genome. After, Gene Freq takes aligned sequences (Bam files) and inputs them into Strelka (another open source software) which detects genomic variants in the 'after' DNA. Gene Freq then uses data from the Cancer Gene Census to determine if these mutations are in cancer genes. If the mutations are in cancer genes, then Gene Freq uses a team-developed database of cancer probabilities to solve Bayes Theorem and calculate the probability that the patient has the cancer, given that they have the mutation. This information is displayed in an easily interpreted graph that can either display mutations as a function of quality score or probability of having the cancer. The graph also gives information about the gene that contains the mutation and the associated cancer.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The web application was built using javascripts. The application interfaces with a script written in R which runs BWA mem and Strelka, parses through data to find cancer hits, and calculates the estimated probability that the patient has the cancer given that they have the mutation.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into several challenges surrounding the fact that genomic data is extremely large. This made testing our software very difficult (we didn't have a few days to let programs run). Therefore, we simulated the software using team-developed data. Thus, our application is merely a proof of concept and will need to be tested further in the future for optimization.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Normally, patients are diagnosed with cancer through sequencing of biopsies. However, this can be costly and has associated risks such as seeding new tumors. Our application can be used as a non-invasive method to preliminarily identify cancer risk by detecting mutations associated with circulating tumor cells in the blood. This type of development has far reach applications, and as the cost of sequencing continues to plummet, the need for bioinformatics software will only increase.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it's hard to think on just a few hours of sleep! We also learned a lot about genomics in general, coding in R, and designing web applications.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gene Freq</h2>\n<p>Next up we will try to add more features to our app, such as adding specific patient and healthcare provider portals. We also want to test our software on actual genomics data, and possibly create our own variant calling algorithm with increased sensitivity. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/2d13LBO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bit.ly/2d13LBO\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bit.ly</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped with clinical supporting info, categorization of called mutations, and prognostic factors.", "", ""]], ["Allyx", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Allyx \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/414/426/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Allyx, your personal healthcare companion</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Mental health is one of the largest public health issues that is often overlooked.

If it succeeds, we will expand and take it to other cities in the US, and eventually around the world. One feature that we want to include, that we have not been able to in this prototype, is connecting this platform with the programs doctors use in the office when seeing patients, writing the diagnosis and course of treatment. We believe that this app will become more convenient for doctors if diagnoses can be pulled automatically and confidentially from these medical programs, without requiring the doctor to enter in the data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ManasPurohit/super-bassoon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ManasPurohit/super-bassoon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["MedEx", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MedEx \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/203/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>main screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MedEx \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/200/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>login page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MedEx \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/201/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>EHR browsing page demo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MedEx \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/202/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Medical informed consent page browsing demo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MedEx is a web application developed for both patients and healthcare professionals, providing patients with easy access on medical consent/ EHR information with further educational contents they care about and/ or reveal confusion on, giving suggestions on both educational portal development and guidelines on patients informed consent instructions.\nThe two goals of MedEx are to </p>\n<ol>\n<li>help people understand their medical consent forms/ medical records </li>\n<li>help healthcare professionals/ researchers understand what patients need to understand in their medical documents as well as what is important to patients, and adjust their service guidelines accordingly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Functions and Features proposed:\n    MedEx is a platform enabling patients to interact with their medical records through functions such as in-text vocabulary searches (definitions, resources, images) and multiple language translations. Medical consent forms in PDF format will be accepted.\n    Usage data, such as word searches and cursor activity (heat-maps) will be tracked, processed, and presented to physicians and other professionals who want to gain insight in patient education. Collected usage data and statistics can be presented in a dashboard including charts, graphs, and other visualizations, as well as in informative exportable reports. \n        The application development mainly contains two stages: experimental data collection(experimental phase) and patients user trials (testing phase). \n[1] In experimental phase, a number of volunteer subjects are recruited to read medical consent forms/ EHRs and asked to highlight  and search words/ phrases/ sentences they want to further explore. Their user behaviour are recorded through integration of Mouseflow API, from which heat-map for mouse movement/ clicking event tracking are generated as the raw user behavior data to be analyzed. \n[2] Words/ phrases/ sentences of the most interest will be extracted to comprise a baseline dictionary where each entry is matched with a list of conventional explanatory data sources (doctor definition/ wikipedia/ dynamic google search results, etc). The list of datasource will be present as a drop down menu when users in the testing phase click on a specific expression (list for common items from overlapping expressions will be merged), in which way user are able to redirect themselves to the data sources in an in-app pop-up window. The system constantly analyze real-time user behavior and dynamically adjust entries in the original dictionary of data source lists.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The front-end framework was built using Justinmind prototyper and IntelliJ-IDEA using Javascript, css, html5.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Neither of us had enough back-end fast deployment experience.

This is when the arduino analyzes this data and sends the signal to the appropriate buzzer based on that specific distance. The pitch of the stimulus will increase as the object moves closer to the visually impaired person giving a sense of depth and range of the incoming object. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The EchoBelt was built by attaching 4 ultrasonic sensors to 4 peizo buzzers ( with each component having 1 sensor, and 1 buzzer), onto a belt. Each component would be free to move on the belt and ideally lock into place after moving, to adjust for each individuals unique waist line. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We initially had trouble wiring the arduino to the breadboard to the external components due to the limited connection space, but we overcame this through inductive sonar angle optimization and innovative circuit design. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to run 8 components on the Arduino with fairly quick data readings and signal output. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to properly assembly components on a breadboard, and how to run a large magnitude of devices on one arduino. </p>\n<h2>What's next for EchoBelt</h2>\n<p>In the future we hope to attach vibration motor discs instead of buzzers so that the stimulus may be felt in loud rooms and areas.

Often times \"soccer moms\" will bring their children into their pediatrician the first day that their kids start feeling sick and this is generally not a good thing. In other scenarios, people go to the ER only to wait in long lines and be treated at an inconvenience. Having someone give the right medical advice for a triage would be the best ideal solution to all of these problems in order to decrease healthcare cost and help patients stay healthier and be treated more efficiently.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Amazon Echo is a smart voice enabled assistant that aims to help patients in the medical triage problem. Dr. Alexa asks a series of questions to get a sense for what the user may be feeling and where they are in pain. After assessing the user and through a series of bayesian statistics modeling, Dr. Alexa triages the patient and provides next steps of action.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We did a lot of field research given the amazing mentors and breadth of knowledge at Johns Hopkins University. After talking to many different experts in healthcare and pivoting our original idea, we settled on Doctor Alexa and decided to use Amazon Echo as our main platform and user interface. We built our Amazon Echo Skills using Node.js on a lambda function hosted on AWS (Amazon Web Services). This allows our app to scale automatically utilizing thousands of computers in amazons cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Amazon Echo is a fairly new product from Amazon and its developer community is not that large. Therefore when we got stuck on some problems testing and installing our voice interface, we had very little support both from online discussion forums and from other hackers who had experience using Amazon Echo. Luckily, the few people who were also using echo were able to help us overcome a few obstacles. Another challenge we had was aggregating the right set of questions to have alexa ask in order to correctly predict the most likely disease/illness. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are really proud of the product we were able to make and the real life problems that Doctor Alexa will solve. We talked to many Doctors and Physicians this weekend and they told us first hand the many problems of the healthcare system that a service like Doctor Alexa will solve. Doctor Alexa will help the public health industry, insurance companies, and most importantly help people by guiding them to cheaper, faster and better healthcare.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>Neither of us new any node.js, aws, or even javascript before starting this project. To say that there was a lot that we learned would be a huge understatement. Learning how a voice interface works was extremely insightful and made us appreciate the technology that we take for granted so much.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Doctor Alexa</h2>\n<p>We think that the Amazon Echo is here to stay and as technology advances with more sophisticated natural language processing algorithms, we will be able to create a more user friendly product. We would like to work with other existing triage and symptom-illness services that are already available to add to our resources. We think that we can aggregate a lot of the patient data that already exists to make Doctor Alexa much better at asking the right questions so that she may provide more insightful suggestions for her users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Voraciously reading up Amazon Web Services' Alexa Skill development documentation and tutorials.

We went with Amazon\u2019s Alexa because it is a voice service. Although we have created our custom skill-set using the Amazon Echo, ideally, our add-on to Amazon\u2019s voice service would be optimized for the Dot, as it is portable and better-suited for the aspects of our skill-set that help with navigation (and not as suited for a plugged-in speaker). </p>\n<p>The first aspect of our skill-set involves navigation of a grocery store for finding desired items in aisles. The user can first specify which store they are at, and Alexa will then reference the user\u2019s saved grocery items for foods that are available at the current store, and then give relative directions to the proper location in the store. Then, the second aspect of our skill-set comes into play.</p>\n<p>The second aspect involves image recognition. We have a Nest camera that takes a picture when the user asks it to, and then passes the information to Microsoft Cognitive Services\u2019 Computer Vision API to analyze it. It then returns keywords to describe the environment it sees. This aspect can help in identifying the correct items and determining item prices.</p>\n<p>Together, Alexa and Nest can be used to fully navigate through an indoor location such as a grocery store or an academic hall.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong>\nWe were inspired by videos and blogs of blind people and the problems they vocalized. There were often mentions of certain grocery items (such as canned items) that were difficult to identify, as well as navigating unknown areas. </p>\n<p><strong>What it does</strong>\nIt essentially provides the visually disabled with an indoor navigator and an image descriptor. This allows blind people to be more individually autonomous, whereas previously, many blind people would have asked a friend to help them learn a new area or identify items.</p>\n<p><strong>How I built it</strong>\nWe used AWS to build Alexa\u2019s functionality. Microsoft Cognitive Science\u2019s Computer Vision API was used for image recognition. Alexa\u2019s navigational component was built using JavaScript.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges I ran into</strong>\nWorking with Amazon\u2019s vast collection of services was difficult. Making different components work with each other was a big challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</strong>\nWe\u2019re pretty proud of this as a whole. Getting the image recognition working was great, as was getting Alexa to properly respond to queries. </p>\n<p><strong>What I learned</strong>\nWe learned about working with AWS and the vast array of options that it provides to developers. We also learned how to think from a different perspective to tackle problems that we ourselves do not encounter on a regular basis. </p>\n<p><strong>What's next for Audio Aid for the visually impaired using Amazon Alexa</strong></p>\n<p>We would like to build more to our functionality, such as perhaps video recording to identify traffic, and for more detailed voice descriptions of the surrounding environment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-dynamodb\">amazon-dynamodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lambda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">python2.7</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nest\">nest</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-services</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["radroom", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our background is in neuroscience research.

Despite the terrible conditions, villagers even in the remotest regions were still able to use their phones to communicate. From this experience, he saw the potential of telemedicine via text messaging as a reliable mode of communication. Even in the US, most people prefer to get notifications over text messages compared to other mediums. Because we are constantly overflooded by huge amounts of information, we tend to miss little details. In the realm of healthcare, this applies to prescription adherence, which we often overlook as a non-issue. However, prescription nonadherence costs the medical industry $100 billions a year, despite being an easy issue to fix. So we decided to build Remi, the chatbot that reminds you to take your medication through a medium that you will actually use and is more reliable than the internet. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Remi is a chat bot programmed to remind you to take your medications and refill your prescriptions, answer questions about your prescriptions, and document your adherence behaviors. You can chat with Remi through text message, facebook messenger, and amazon echo. The data Remi collects is accessible on a web app, helloremi.com, that users can sign into to view their adherence habits, dose information, current doctors, prescription refill schedule, doctor visits, and doctors on their insurance plan.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We split up work based on expertise. Yitaek did the voice interface and twilio integration. James did full stack development. Hannah did the front end and design.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Figuring out how to structure the data for both doctors and end users to track their status.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we successfully combined react and webflow, launched the Remi dashboard in 48 hours, and that Remi can use multiple channels to reach out to users.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to schedule messages, how to use the echo, how to use lambda functions on AWS to build a serverless chat bot, how to deploy a web server, how to make cool visualizations of tables and graphs, and how to animate Remi on the dashboard. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Remi</h2>\n<p>Next, we will build image recognition so our users can take pictures of their prescriptions bottles and insurance cards and their information can auto populate in our server.  We\u2019ll build dashboards for insurance companies to monitor their clients adherence behaviors and offer perks to clients with good medication adherence.  And we\u2019ll build dashboards for doctors, so they can monitor their patients\u2019 adherence behaviors and reach out through Remi if they see a drop in medication habits.  Because Remi is a lightweight text bot, it can have a huge impact not only in the U.S, but also in developing countries where texting and facebook messenger are the primary forms of communication. Our team has traveled to Nepal, Nicaragua and Tanzania and seen the impact text based telemedicine can have on their health care.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">griddle</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rechart</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">forever</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-compute-engine\">google-compute-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Yitaek/Remi-MedHacks.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Yitaek/Remi-MedHacks.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.helloremi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.helloremi.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.helloremi.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on full stack functionality for the web app, integrating the designed code into react and linking the front end to firebase.", "I worked on building a voice interface using Alexa and setting SMS reminder messages using Twilio's API.

Additionally, it could be used as an assessment tool in ERs to reduce redundancy in questioning by having patients fill out the questionnaire; nurses and doctors would then be able to review and confirm each patient\u2019s symptoms and medical history more swiftly in order to better direct their care. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/emilylo/OptimizER\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/emilylo/OptimizER\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["VR Tx", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VR Tx \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/414/471/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>the simulation house</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Disasters can occur unpredictably and it could be traumatic for kids, especially if they don\u2019t know what to do.

The most prevalent ones are hypertension and depression, with projections indicating that by 2020, depression will become the most prevalent comorbid disorder. Multiple studies have confirmed that an individual in a hospital is more likely to face depression, most likely due to the stresses that come along with an extended hospital stay.</p>\n<h5>In short, long-term inpatients suffer from:</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Lack of meaningful interaction</li>\n<li>Loss of independence</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>The combination of these two factors creates an ideal environment for CMD to take root. How can we avoid these two factors?</h5>\n<h3>Interaction</h3>\n<p><strong>What do we mean by \"meaningful?\"</strong></p>\n<p>Patient care journals list a parameter known as self-perceived burden, which is how patients tend to view themselves as a burden on those they are communicating with. This can play a large part in leading to CMD. Conversations which patients perceive as a burden are not meaningful interactions, and therefore counterproductive to our goal of improving patient care.</p>\n<p><strong>By what means can a patient interact with others?</strong></p>\n<p>There are many ways, each with their unique pros and cons.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Converse with other people in the room (medical personnel, visitors).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the ideal form of communication, but it is quite hard to come by. Hospital staff are incredibly busy, and it is impossible for them to hold extended conversations with each and every patient. Some patients are lucky enough to have close relatives or friends as visitors, but often times the patient can feel as if they are being a burden on the guests, especially if these guests have jobs, errands, and activities to attend to.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Social media (Facebook, Twitter).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Social media is an excellent alternative to face-to-face conversation, especially due to the \"equalizing\" effect of the Internet, and the convenience for the other party. However, social media can be a wild card, as a patient's news feed is usually filled with pictures of their friends' interesting activities. This can be very demoralizing, as they cannot do anything exciting in their present condition.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h5>To avoid the shortcomings of these interactions, we need a population of people who have plenty of free time, as well as an implicit respect for the physical limitations of a long-term inpatient.</h5>\n<h4>Who fits this description better than other patients?</h4>\n<p>Indeed, this is where our app, forest, comes in.</p>\n<h2>Forest is a social network app designed <em>for rest</em>, not for activity.</h2>\n<h2>Design Philosophy.</h2>\n<p>The design philosophy of forest is to give users as much independence as possible, while upholding strict privacy and safety standards.</p>\n<p><em>Not all of these functionalities are implemented in their entirety due to time constraints, but the information given in this section details the result of continued development on forest.</em></p>\n<h3>Privacy and Safety</h3>\n<p>Although patients' use of forest is purely voluntary, adhering to HIPAA standards was a chief concern for designing forest, as we want to encourage patients to take advantage of the service as much as possible, and this will only happen if they are not worried about disseminating protected health information. Also, as access is only given to inpatients, users of the chat service are all actually patients.</p>\n<p>Mental health is a very sensitive issue, and we treat it as such. Forest implements a \"better-safe-than-sorry\" approach to filtering offensive words and explicit content. Also, users have the ability to block other users, making that user's messages invisible to them. Forest is an awesome system for spreading positivity and kindness, which unfortunately makes it equally effective at breeding pessimism and malice, and we employ this system to protect users from the destructive outcome.</p>\n<h3>Independence</h3>\n<p>While in the hospital, patients have very little control of their lives. Their entire schedule revolves around whatever medications, procedures, and exams that they will have that day, and they are offered very little opportunities to make their own decisions. This is why giving the users as much independence as possible within the bounds of privacy and safety was our goal.</p>\n<h4>Usernames</h4>\n<p>Creating your forest username is simple.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose an animal.</li>\n<li>Choose a color.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>That's it!</em> You're now signed in to forest. If someone else has chosen the same animal and color, you'll get a number at the end to distinguish yourself from the other creative folks who wanted to be \"Red Bull\" or \"Orange Chicken.\"</p>\n<p>Having just two degrees of freedom seems counterproductive to the philosophy of independence, but, indeed, this is the optimal middle ground between anonymity and personalization.</p>\n<h4>Curating your forest</h4>\n<p>Users can subscribe to interest <code>trees</code>, which contain top-level discussion about broad conversational topics, as well as user-generated <code>branches</code> which aim to discuss more specific topics.</p>\n<p>Again, the ability to customize the topics they are interested in provides a way for patients to express themselves. Also, our terminology emulates a trek through nature, which can be soothing for long-term inpatients.</p>\n<h4>Connections</h4>\n<p>There are three unique trees:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>Support</code></li>\n<li><code>Success</code></li>\n<li><code>Direct Messages</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p><code>Support</code> and <code>Success</code> are entirely anonymous channels, i.e. even usernames won't be visible in these channels.</p>\n<p>A patient, upon discharge, will retain access to <code>Success</code> and <code>Direct Messages</code> for one week. During this time, it is up to their volition whether they would like to post a farewell comment in <code>Success</code> and if they want to exchange permanent contact information with any of the users in their direct messages.</p>\n<h5><code>Support</code></h5>\n<p>A place for people to express their complaints and frustrations to others, promote healthy expression of emotions</p>\n<h5><code>Success</code></h5>\n<p>A place for those about to be discharged to say goodbye to the community.</p>\n<h5><code>Direct Messages</code></h5>\n<p>If two users form a more personal friendship in one of the chatrooms, they have to option to send a direct message to them. From here, these users can have a personal conversation.</p>\n<h2>Benefits.</h2>\n<p>Forest is well suited to urban hospitals with a small doctor:patient ratio. This is where patient need is the greatest. The use of forest can greatly improve patient satisfaction, which can lead to better performance on Press-Ganey surveys.</p>\n<p>As per our mission, forest creates an environment for patients to socialize with a group of people that are empathetic to their current situation, and not feel like they are burdening their audience. By restricting access to only inpatients, we can minimize harassment and abuse.</p>\n<h2>Business Model.</h2>\n<p>Forest creates clear value for hospitals in the form of decreasing their healthcare expenditures, while simultaneously improving their patient\u2019s quality of care. This is achieved through improved recovery times, patient short and long term outcomes, and quality of life during their stay. As a result, our business model will be to charge each individual hospital per average number of active users per month. More specifically, we would use a step-pricing program.</p>\n<p>In order to penetrate the market we plan to create a pilot program in conjunction with an urban hospital. We would ask the hospital to cover the costs of setting up the program in exchange for use of the application for the extent of the trial. This program would be used to evaluate the efficacy of our app while simultaneously using the potential success of our program as the beginning of a marketing campaign.</p>\n<h2>Future Directions.</h2>\n<h4>Accessibility features</h4>\n<p>As many inpatients may need to use accessibility features, our goal with continued development is to provide a comprehensive accessibility suite for these users. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Large text</li>\n<li>Speech to text</li>\n<li>High contrast</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Deep Learning</h4>\n<p>Sent messages on forest can be used to monitor mental state of patients. With deep learning algorithms, we can train the computer to become more accurate at identifying early signs of mental health disorders based on their usage of certain flagged terms in forest. This is an incredibly important application, as catching signs of mental illnesses early can significantly increase the potential effectiveness of the treatment.</p>\n<h1>forest: for rest.</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-dynamodb\">amazon-dynamodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["JSON Schema, Graphic Design, Marketing", "Software Architect, Chief AWS coordinator, JSON Designer, Executive Delivery Boy", "Design.

We sort of know what the effects are, but how does one track and quantify something as fluid as the cause of stress across a large body of people?</p>\n<p>We constantly see university organizations trying help students deal with stress\u2014through counseling services and other means of addressing the symptoms, yet we've never encountered a way of seeing what symptoms are being felt over the course of time.</p>\n<p>Plenty of people have tried to alleviate the stresses of university life, or life in general, in a number of ways, but nobody has yet created a means of really seeing how a body of people reacts to such treatments long-term, nor is there a way of tracking wellbeing at an organizational level over a long period of time. With such a powerful diagnostic tool, we are hopeful that we can really effect a positive change in the stress cultures at our schools as well as other organizations.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our idea is simple: take the simple concept of surveys, and expand it to the next level. Instead of having one-off surveys, why not have a constantly stream of feedback\u2014as often as weekly\u2014that can be aggregated and tracked?</p>\n<p>We created a feedback system that provides real time analytics on members of organizations by tracking group responses to surveys. Using this data, we establish a base-line of manageable behavior and newly incoming data against it. Thus we are able to identify trends in the mental, physical, social, and academic wellbeing of large bodies of people, mark when and why stress increases or decreases from week to week among them, and pinpoint what people find most troubling at different points in time.</p>\n<p>The app has people in an organization anonymously answer pre-designed questions about their environment and quality of life. Based on users' answers, the questions branch into other questions to better taylor surveys to the specific group of people taking them.</p>\n<p>Such a powerful tracking and diagnostic tool could be implemented by universities seeking to clarify what causes the most stress and when amongst their student bodies, CEO's wishing to develop better management strategies based off of department or even company-wide trends in wellbeing, and NASA scientists trying to track a space crew's mental and physical responses to different stimuli. The possibilities are endless.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a full stack infrastructure for our product. First we created an Android mobile app as we found this was the most popular platform for obtaining student data. On this Android mobile app, we created an interactive, customizable user interface. The 100% anonymous responses collected from a student on the app platform are sent to a NoSQL database in JSON format. This data is then accessed by authenticated users on the other end such as university professors and officials, in varying scopes depending on specific need to ensure privacy of student data. For example, a professor would be able to see data and subsequent statistical analysis from his or her classes, while a department head would be able to see data from students in the same department. To allow for such monitoring, we created a website that takes the raw information from our database, organizes it, and displays it in graph form. Administrators of surveys can select specific ranges of time over which to see data, and can inspect specific data point for a more in-depth look. By designing our product around our infrastructure, we ensured that it would be highly scalable to various universities, corporations, and research groups worldwide. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was the first hackathon for several members of our team, and we encouraged members to develop parts of the stack that they were unfamiliar with. Working with databases, designing apps and websites, and putting all of this together were all firsts. We struggled at a few points with putting each of our parts together, but managed to succeed with version control.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are extremely proud to have created an innovative product that can help potentially thousands of people. We hope to use what we've created to make our own college campuses, Carnegie Mellon and Johns Hopkins, into better educational environments. We're very thankful for the opportunity to help improve the lives of our friends.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>By encouraging members of our team to develop parts of the stack they were unfamiliar with, we helped everyone learn something new while simultaneously having fun doing so. For example, we had members learn about Android apps, responsive web development, backend NoSQL real-time databases, and how to run statistical analysis scripts on data sets.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Aggregate</h2>\n<p>Aggregate is currently in prototype phase, where we have created a fully functional project ready for further improvement and scaling. Our next hope is to take our concept to our test market of our own schools, Carnegie Mellon and Johns Hopkins, which are currently exploring solutions to better improve the satisfaction of students by means of creating more responsive environments. Additionally, we would be interested in seeking intellectual patents for our proprietary service and funding to further develop and perfect Aggregate. If our initial test market is successful, we will explore similar university audiences and potentially scale to large corporations around the nation. Overall, we hope to make the world a better place with Aggregate. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nosql</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/polymer\">polymer</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rdong97/Aggregate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rdong97/Aggregate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://aggregateapp.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://aggregateapp.tech/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>aggregateapp.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dau9fc9smmvqo.cloudfront.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dau9fc9smmvqo.cloudfront.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>dau9fc9smmvqo.cloudfront.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I took care of the front-end Android application (Java in Android Studio), graphics/UI, question chains, UX, and video.", "I created the concept and developed the backend infrastructure and designed the data structures we utilized in facilitating unidirectional data transfer from mobile app upstream to NoSQL database to web visualization.", "^^^I tried to fix this guy's run on sentences ^^^", "I worked on the graphic design elements such as the logo, the typography, and presentation slides, among others.

We also need to clean up the website a bit and make it look professional and maybe if we're lucky, get some endorsements!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">shiny</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Cydrew/MedHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Cydrew/MedHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked heavily on the from end, and did some debugging on the backend especially in helping pass data from the front end to the back end and vice versa.", "I did most of the R computational analysis.
