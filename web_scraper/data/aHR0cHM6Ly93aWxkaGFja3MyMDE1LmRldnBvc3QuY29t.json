The multitude of logos at Hackthons and on CS Majors laptops served as a perfect, well-suited medium to play a round of awesome AR semi-virtual hunting!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our program leverages off of the Android version of Unity to create a multiplayer scavenger hunt to be played with the sponsor logos as the targets.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Vuforia and Unity- the former to render the AR interface, the latter to handle just about all of our actual game code. We also used Azure for hosting the backend server information (which allowed for multiuser support without much additional code), and interfaced it all with JSON-based HTTP requests (and a bit of duct tape, too).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Vuforia posed a few challenges both in its being something none of us have had experience with, and in some limitations associated with the API itself (i.e., only one model of a single type could be rendered at a given time; the comparative weakness of the Android phones kept our sense of scale in check; etc). Virtual buttons were one major stumbling block, since we were having major problems until we understood fundamentally what was wrong with our code. These issues took the longest to fix, because we could only remedy them when we had a deep intuition as to the way the code actually worked, which by nature isn't something to learn in the span of a few minutes.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This was our first venture into AR, and it ended up being a really awesome looking, visually-packed program!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>That OnTrackedLost and GPS coordinates can be a replacement for virtual buttons, providing huge potential applications in our future with working with AR.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ScavAR</h2>\n<p>Expanding into payment within the app itself, and adding more awesome features like direct player-to-player interactions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vuforia\">vuforia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://scavar.azurewebsites.net/_site/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://scavar.azurewebsites.net/_site/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>scavar.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I made sure everything stayed on track, worked on the hologram animations, and wrote Vuforia scripts in an attempt to integrate virtual buttons.", "I wrote the server to keep track of things on the back end and  also made a few of the 3D models that we used for the AR simulations", "I worked with the Unity plugin Vufloria which allowed us to process 2D images in a 3D space with a phone camera.", "I wrote the code that let Unity interface with the server, made a couple of models, and helped solve problems related to the C# language/Unity when they arose.", "I worked on integrating Vufloria in Unity with Jonathan."]], ["PolarFeed", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PolarFeed \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/829/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PolarFeed \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/856/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PolarFeed \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/854/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PolarFeed \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/855/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PolarFeed \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/857/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Remember the good old days when Kodak existed and Polaroids was the bomb?

Most high school seniors have a hard time choosing a school because universities give out similar brochures and flyers in a rather depersonalized way. yoursTruly aims to give prospective college students a real experience of the school by connecting them to the atmosphere and environment of the university, facilitating communication between students of the present and future.</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>yoursTruly is an iOS app that allows current college students to leave their voice messages at certain locations on campus, such as stories, memories, and opinions. Prospective students can then approach the locations and listen to the stories of the current students. Therefore, they can get a more personal and interactive perspective of what the university is like.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>The iOS app is coded in Swift. We used the Google Maps API for location tracking, Estimote beacons for location-based audio storage and retrieval, and Parse for the database. We crowd-sourced location based audio files from real Northwestern students and stored them to different classes in our database, based on each location. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>This is our first time working with beacon, so we spent quite some time setting them up. The Estimote documentation and online examples were geared toward Objective-C more so than Swift, so another initial challenge was figuring out if the smartphones were detected within the beacon detection range.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of how quickly we were able to learn everything within 24 hours, building an app that is fully functional and visually pleasing. Our team has diverse skill sets and was therefore able to complement each other and taking different roles in the team. \nBeyond making the backend functional, we put a lot of thought into UI design. We chose orange as our theme color because it carries the meaning of \"Truth\". Also, we chose an arrow (symbolizing going forward from high school into college) made out of a pause button and play button, since we have an audio app. </p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>From the product side, we learned about the process of product design. We created a project timeline to split the main tasks, including front-end, back-end, and user interface, to keep track of product progress. From the technical side, we explored how to use the Google Maps API and integrating our app with the Beacon technology. We also collected user feedback, and modified our app accordingly. </p>\n<h2>What's Next for yoursTruly</h2>\n<p>We would explore more in depth on how beacon operates technically, and what else we do with beacons. For example, beacons are best used for indoor positioning, and how can we better utilize this feature to indoor college touring.<br/>\nWe will study more about motivation for current students to contribute to the database. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/estimote\">estimote</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yhx189/WildHacks.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yhx189/WildHacks.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the user interface design for this!\n", "", "", ""]], ["Drop", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Drop \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/815/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Drop \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/816/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I happen to live in the woods and my mother is always afraid of being alone in the house and falling, getting hurt, and not being able to contact anyone.

Many organizations in both industry and academia utilize visualizations when making important decisions.  However, these visualizations are inherently inaccessible to blind and visually impaired community members, blocking them from participating in these conversations.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Tactile translates the graphs displayed on a screen into tangible movements.</p>\n<p>Anne Sullivan, Helen Keller's teacher, realized that she could translate visible sign language symbols into patterns on the palm of Helen's hand.  Inspired by this method, Tactile traces the datasets typically represented in a line graph along the user's palm.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Both the traditional visualizations and the tactile behavior are controlled by a Node.js server on an Intel Edison.  The traditional visualizations are represented in a dashboard describing the state of the housing market in Detroit, the type of dashboard that community decision-makers at the Land Policy Institute might use.  The tactile component is driven by two servos with flexible plastic rods attached to them, which rotate over a few seconds to represent the relationship between the lines over time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were brand new to Intel Edison development and fairly unused to hardware development in general.  We brought some simple starter kits for Arduino and Raspberry Pi with us, but we were expecting on the MLH Hardware Lab to have a lot more hardware and actuators available.  Therefore we needed to do a lot of brainstorming to find something that could meet the challenge of representing something visual to non-visual people.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Working with hardware is complicated, and in the future we should probably enlist an electrical engineer.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tactile</h2>\n<p>The original plan for Tactile was to create a literal heat map, where bulbs of different colors would heat up to different (safe-to-the-touch) temperatures to create a tactile map that could represent color gradients for people who can't see colors.  This would also be helpful for colorblind people.  When we have access to the proper heating elements, we will add this component to the system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">morris.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["\"R&D department\" of the team, determining what tools to use and testing out different ways the tactile interaction could work.

We decided that a smart doorbell / front door security system would be both fun and a good challenge for us. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We have designed a doorbell which, when pressed, will buzz and then send a text message straight to your phone telling you that someone is at your door. You can then choose to respond to this message (to let the person at the door know that you'll be out in five minutes) or you can ignore the message. This allows for all of the convenience and utility of a regular doorbell along with the modern capability of receiving text messages. This is helpful in situations where a traditional doorbell fails, such as: when you're not home, when you're in a part of your house where the doorbell can't be heard, etc. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our initial design was a motion sensor which would alert the homeowner that someone is at the door. We were designing this with the Intel Edison. However, this design is still very buggy and as such we went with a different approach -- a button (\"doorbell\") which connects to an Arduino board. Upon being pressed, a POST request is sent to a server which then sends a text message to the homeowner through the Twilio API. The homeowner can then respond to this message through another POST request which then writes the message to an LCD screen which is on the door. The server and web application was designed with Python and Flask; the circuitry used was Arduino; the API used was Twilio. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One challenge was integrating IoT (internet-of-things) into the project. We were initially going to have a board that wirelessly sends a POST request based on a motion or light sensor. However, we ran into some difficulties with network security (the Particle Spark Core would not connect to the web in any way) and then with firmware issues (the Intel Edison would not upgrade to a firmware which would allow for standalone WiFi interaction). So, we designed the bulk of the project without IoT and are instead working on it as a feature for the project in the future. </p>\n<p>Another challenge was sending messages from the server to the LCD screen. The interaction between the serial and the server was written in Python. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our Twilio integration. Ultimately, we were able to smoothly send and receive text messages through our doorbell system and with the Twilio API. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that hardware has a whole sea of problems with it, much like software does. However, while these problems are scary for people who don't deal with hardware often, they are still solvable problems. This project taught us how to deal with hardware and how to deal with the issues that come with it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for chimr</h2>\n<p>We are going to integrate IoT at some point, once the hardware is less buggy. The idea is for the board itself to send the POST requests instead of through another computer. This allows for less requirements for the project, which is desirable by any consumer. Besides this, we are considering adding an optional keyboard to the LCD screen or microphone on the door which allows for the visitor to communicate with the homeowner instead of just the homeowner sending messages to the visitor. In addition, we hope to integrate with wooden doors at some point. Finally, we aim to have two components: a small hardware component and a mobile or web application that users can download to use with the hardware.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jacksondavis/chimr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jacksondavis/chimr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on implementing Internet of Things (IoT) and added buzzer.

Created at WildHacks 2015.</p>\n<h2>Purpose</h2>\n<p>For a foreigner, learning to speak a new language can be challenging and intimidating.\nCorrecting an accent isn't easy, and sometimes people are treated differently based on their accents.</p>\n<p>NoAccent! helps users correct their accents by using visual and audio input to provide suggestions for improvement.</p>\n<h2>Use</h2>\n<p>NoAccent! focuses on correcting pronunciation at the smallest level, one word at a time! The app interface features a list of commonly mispronounced English words. Users can pick a word from the list that they want to practice. From there, NoAccent! records a user's mouth movements while he/she pronounces the word.</p>\n<p>Then, two views of the user's mouth are generated: a frontal view and a lateral view. The frontal view overlays an animation of the mouth movement for Space Cat, a native English speaker, over the user's mouth movement for the word. The lateral view analyzes sound frequencies to approximates the user's lip and tongue positions and compares positional differences between the user and Space Cat. Based on their performances, the app will also provide users with suggestions for improving their pronunciation.</p>\n<h2>Future additions</h2>\n<p>WildHacks 2015 was a short 24-hour hackathon; we had just enough time to produce a working version of our app. However, there are lot of features that we would love to implement in the future!</p>\n<p>NoAccent! currently only features a short list of easily mispronounced English words. However, the app can easily be expanded to include other languages as well. For each language, all that's needed is a database of commonly mispronounced words and an authentic speaker in the language for recording mouth movement.</p>\n<p>We also want to pinpoint specific ways for improving pronunciation by using machine learning algorithms (Google Tensorflow) to analyze user audio recordings and by using facial recognition mouth contour detection to analyze differences in mouth movement.</p>\n<h2>Team</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Richard Wei (iOS developer)</li>\n<li>Yang Yinghua (designer/linguist)</li>\n<li>Dan Zheng (web developer)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Technologies</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Xcode / Swift: iOS development</li>\n<li>Praat: spectrograms (visual representations of audio input)</li>\n<li>HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap: website <a href=\"http://no-accent.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">(no-accent.me)</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://no-accent.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://no-accent.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>no-accent.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Dan-Zheng/No-Accent\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Dan-Zheng/No-Accent\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the iOS app.", "", ""]], ["Homeline Bling", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Homeline Bling \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/784/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Homeline Bling \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/326/208/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration/What it Does</h2>\n<p>Many people on the streets have no access to mobile devices or Wifi, and no way of finding a temporary home for the night. Homeline Bling is a hotline homeless people can call using a street payphone, and the hotline will relay the name and location of the closest shelter near the caller. So for those late, cold nights, Homeline Bling will provide you with a home.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>When a caller calls the hotline, which is set up using Twillio, and the location of the payphone is extracted using Google geocaching API. The location of the closest shelter is then calculated through our web application built in Django. Then using Twillio's text-to-speech API, the name and location of the closest shelter is relayed back to the user. The web application also allows representatives from shelters to update or add their information on our database. The website is hosted on the cloud using Microsoft Azure. </p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use the Django framework, and linking Twillio with a web application.

This information was collected using Beautiful Soup 4, a Python library, which we utilized to scrape anchor tags in the HTML files of a user-provided starting site. Data is requested by the client-side through a WebSocket protocol and is subsequently stored in a MongoDB database located on our Nginx web server (set up through Azure). If the client requests data that's already been requested before, it's pulled from the database in order to save time and computational power.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We each challenged ourselves making Webscape. Steven, who didn't have a lot of prior experience with three.js, encountered his fair share of issues with shaders and node connection. Morgan found WebSocket and Flask to be huge learning curves due to his inexperience in back end, but was also stumped by some front-end troubles. Josh worked primarily on implementation of our collective design thoughts- which must've been pretty hard since we couldn't always agree! Yoseph had the very unique challenge of leading a bunch of rookies while still finding his own problems in building the database and making the Beautiful Soup scraper compatible with Morgan's Flask program.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We each stretched ourselves thin in order to get this project done. Josh and Morgan learned a lot about the cohesiveness of a full stack project. Steven learned more about three.js than he's been able to in his own time this semester and that was a goal of his. Yoseph was incredibly proud of his Python web crawler. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Webscape</h2>\n<p>There are improvements that could be made to the UX of this project. We'd also like to add functionality for metadata crawling- when the user clicks on a node then site data is displayed in the side panel. We have a lot of ideas, and we'd love to talk with you all about them!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nginx\">nginx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gevent</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/beautiful-soup\">beautiful-soup</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I entirely worked on the 3d rendering environment complete with nodes, links, and eye-catching shaders.

Game design has been a subject the team has been interested in, with a focus on VR and AR, so we decided to make an interactive AR card game. Groupon's tech talk also inspired us to add a little flare to the game design by incorporating <strong>SpaceCat</strong> at an appropriate but comical level.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>After starting up your Google Cardboard, you look at the designated board and watch as the opponents appear on the mat, ready to duel. With the motion of your hand and a magnetic toggle on the side of your Google Cardboard, you, the player, are able to cycle through a set of different types of attacks against your opponent by hovering your hand over an attack button. After each attack, the turn transfers to the opponent. This all may seem like too simple a game, but with the right card, you can wreak havoc upon your opponent in an ultimate finale of mayhem and destruction.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The team utilized Unity for animations and creating the 3D world. With the Vuforia package, we were able to create trackers for the mat and different sections on the mat for the opponents to appear over. We then scripted the actions the opponents would make using C#, and then built and ran what we had using the Android SDK and put our Android smartphones into our Google Cardboards to live the <strong>Cattack!</strong> experience.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>For most of the team, WildHacks was the first time we used Unity. Plus, this was our first hackathon for most people on the team. We had to learn how to deal with the amount of work while balancing sleep.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Utilizing Unity was a bit of a learning curve: with half-hour tutorials and countless mistakes, we learned a great deal in a short amount of time and were able to build a MVP which we were happy to call our own. We also worked extremely hard with barely any sleep, if any, throughout the night. We're proud of that itself.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The team learned a great deal about Unity and 3D modeling, as well as AR tracking. Getting our hands dirty with Unity helped us bring a unique game to the table and implement a lot of custom and fun animations in the attack functions we use.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AR Cattack!</h2>\n<p>We'll want to continue to develop the card system for the game so that different opponents can be swapped in and out. We'd also want to spruce things up a bit and make things a little prettier! Multi-player mode is something we have on the backlog as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ar</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vuforia\">vuforia</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zippylicious/duelar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zippylicious/duelar\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created animations for the 3D models while also modifying and creating textures to use with Unity.", "I worked on developing the game mechanics in Unity and created AR trackers that I implemented with Vuforia.", "I worked on developing the game in Unity as well as 3D modelling.

We began by experimenting with the Leap Motion and quickly fell in love with its intuitive motion-mapping over conventional systems, such as buttons or joysticks. We initially planned to implement multi-factor authentication by including facial recognition; however, our computer webcams were too weak to process this data quickly and effectively. Nevertheless, we have developed a complete and robust product with a beautiful interface and intuitive controls. Plus, we have learned how to manage ourselves and our teammates to maximize, and even surpass, our individual potentials.

This is a public health problem. People living in food deserts face twice as high a risk of cardiovascular disease. Many of Chicago's food deserts are located on the South Side. Even those who can afford to go to grocery stores often do not have time to do so and must jump through hoops just to access them. Sometimes, grocery stores are even in gang territory. Our goal is to provide a visualization mechanism to see what the problem is like on an everyday level. We often get caught up in the statistics, and the notion of going to bed hungry is so foreign to us that it has prevented us from engaging the issue. This is an attempt to help people visualize the problems of living in a food desert on the South Side of Chicago.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>While there are many static one factor maps produced, there are not many maps which display the various challenges that people in food deserts may face, such as gang activity, a higher proportion of crime, etc. We scraped a whole lot of data from the U.S census, the City of Chicago, NHGIS, etc. to produce an accurate representation of how resources are allocated throughout the city, and what demographics have access to those resources. </p>\n<p>Users can type in their address or potential residential area and see what kind of environment they are living in. Currently they can visualize gang activity, access to restaurant vs. stores, and can be shown how long it takes to get to the nearest grocery store. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, we have integrated a postmates api into the site which will allow those who can't get access to fresh food, to attain a perhaps more diverse meal through a relatively cheap delivery service.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Django framework along with d3 for data visualization and pandas to clean the data. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many problems acquiring datasets, unpacking and cleaning esoteric file formats such as sf1. </p>\n<p>Overlaying an interactive map using d3 over Google Maps.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Got a pretty nice looking impact-full website. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Food Desert</h2>\n<p>Building out a few more data implementations, as well as applying some neural networks towards predicting health within Chicago.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postmates\">postmates</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://wildhacks2015fd.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wildhacks2015fd.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>wildhacks2015fd.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["TrafficSim", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Traffic Simulator</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/m26jiang/TrafficSim\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/m26jiang/TrafficSim\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["INCedin", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In the world of connectivity, a companies reputation is perhaps its most vital asset.

Also interesting would be to do personality analysis of posters based on linked list of all posts to compare how different personality profiles effect brand response. This could display a lack of brand connection with certain types of users. This data could be used to either target the market for products to the users best connected to the company or to add branding and marketing to connect with users currently unconnected.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/symfony\">symfony</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://incedin.kylemattimore.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://incedin.kylemattimore.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>incedin.kylemattimore.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kmattimo/INCedIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kmattimo/INCedIn\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Designed relational database schema for efficient, interesting queries across the reddit data.

Even though there are so many websites for searching hotels or flights, there is basically no website that will automatically generate itinerary  for travelers. Thus, we believe this will be a useful tool for travelers!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://itinerary.azurewebsites.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">It automatically generates an itinerary for travelers</a>. After entering a destination, budget, and duration, the web app will automatically generate the best attractions they should visit and the best hotels to stay within their budget. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Javascript and HTML/CSS to build the website. We used the Google Places API to gather information on attractions and hotels and built out internal algorithm to plan an optimal vacation that visits all of the most prominent attractions and puts the user in the best hotel under budget. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Navigating API and finding appropriate API are the first few challenges we met. Since we allow users to impose both cost and time restrictions, the development of the algorithm also took a lot of discussion!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The computation and automation process is faster than we believed possible and we were able to deliver our core value. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, basic assumptions are necessary to make things work and build a basic model, and we were forced to confront that in building a functional project with the limited nature of the resources available to us. Additionally, we gained major experience building a dynamic website using Javascript and interacting with web APIs to build a web app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Itinerary</h2>\n<p>We believe local events are also a key component for travelers' plans, and we will include recommended events during the traveling dates in our next step. We didn't include it in this version mostly due to the limitations of Eventbrite's/Ticketmaster's API. The hotel recommendation will also be improved if we get access to Expedia's API, which was not available this weekend, while our attraction recommendations would be refined by access to the TripAdvisor API . </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/groupon\">groupon</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AdamHe17/itinerary-put-together-thing.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AdamHe17/itinerary-put-together-thing.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["COLLECTr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"COLLECTr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/807/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"COLLECTr \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/808/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"COLLECTr \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/809/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"COLLECTr \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/844/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It started out with the goal of analysis in mind.

For example, you could recite the plot of a movie but couldn't come up with the title. Other people are great at answering these kinds of questions, but existing search tools like IMDb aren't so great--you can only search by Title, Actors, etc. We wanted to create an application that could answer these kinds of questions, and provide an intuitive interface: one that a user can interact with as if they were describing the plot to another person.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Qasis allows a user to search for movies based on a natural language description of the plot.</p>\n<p><strong>Sample queries:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>family of superheroes fights a redheaded villain</li>\n<li>farm boy battles the empire</li>\n<li>kid from coal mining town builds a rocket</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Should return:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Incredibles</li>\n<li>Star Wars</li>\n<li>October Sky</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>The top 1000 movies were scraped from IMDB using kimono lab's scraping tool and OMDB. These were then loaded into a Postres database and preprocessed (removed stopwords, stemmed, etc.). An information-retrieval algorithm then parsed keywords from the query, calculated Term-Frequency, Inverse-Document-Frequency scores for each of the movie synopses, and ranked by their relevance using python. A jQuery interface then rendered this data for the end user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We originally tried to build a React.js front-end but the learning curve was too steep for the time we had. Additionally IMBD does not publicly share movie posters so a work around had to be built with The Movie Database. Finally, computation speed was a bottleneck. For example, we were able to make marginal performance improvements to the scoring algorithm by including keyword synonyms/synset-lemmas (related words based on grammar hierarchies) but they came at a much greater speed cost, so in the interest of user experience we did not include that feature.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/handlebars-js\">handlebars.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ai</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://qasis.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://qasis.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>qasis.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kenumovies/movie_scraper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kenumovies/movie_scraper\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kenumovies/flask\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kenumovies/flask\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["The front end", "I focused on the information-retrieval algorithm and NLP", ""]], ["Project Epiphany", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Epiphany \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/787/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Epiphany \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/789/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I wouldn't want to read an about me from an author about themselves.

Instead we settled on face++, and that put us into the process of actually building a set of faces. We used a preexisting set of faces, and picked ten of them more or less at random.

The API finds three candidates for who Han Solo is, although none of them are Harrison and none of the choices are made with high confidence.</p>\n<p>This brought up an interesting point, that IBM Bluemix is able to evaluate faces for age; we'd definitely like to pursue using that as a factor in matching, so that we only try to match faces that are similar in (approximate) age.</p>\n<p>In the future we're considering using profile photos of friends on Facebook, or linked people on LinkedIn as the face set, so as you're looking at someone in front of you, your device can pick from people that you already know (rather than trying to choose from a potentially much larger face set). We also see application in situations such as people experiencing dementia that struggle to identify people-- perhaps a list of suggestions that include names and photos would be enough to assist one's memory.</p>\n<p>Finally, it should be noted that no evidence was gathered as to who shot first.</p>\n<p>Our test pictures: <a href=\"https://www.airmanopus.net/wildhacks2015/lfw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.airmanopus.net/wildhacks2015/lfw/</a> (we picked 10 at random to use as our face set)\nOur code:  <a href=\"https://github.com/airmanopus/wildhacks2015\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/airmanopus/wildhacks2015</a>\nUses the face++ API from <a href=\"http://www.faceplusplus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.faceplusplus.com/</a> to recognize faces in photos and match those faces to names</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">facial-recognition</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.airmanopus.net/wildhacks2015/train.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.airmanopus.net/wildhacks2015/train.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.airmanopus.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/airmanopus/wildhacks2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/airmanopus/wildhacks2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the javascript that submitted photos to the face set, trained the face set, and did some face matching.", "I researched Bluemix"]], ["Event-notifier", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Event-notifier \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/547/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Event-notifier</h1>\n<p>It's a pain to keep track of every single thing going on at large events, whether that be Hackathons, Conferences, or even a social! </p>\n<p>Organiziers also have a tough time reaching out to the correct people they need to!</p>\n<p>Event-notifier simply provides a schedule users can subscribe to using their phone number.

fighting game in the browser controlled by phones as game controllers. Here's the twist: <strong>the louder and longer</strong> you shout into your phone, the more powerful your game character becomes!</p>\n<p>The fighting game was made with HTML Canvas and Javascript and the game controller apps were made in Android. I created the realtime connection between the game controllers and the game in node.js. The Android apps simply send POST requests to the server constantly, which updates several variables in the database. The game receives those updates by constantly sending GET requests.</p>\n<p>Here's how the game works:</p>\n<p>Game characters (Yoshis) are able to move sideways, block, and jump with four buttons. They are also able to do a melee move and shoot a fireball. When a player yells into her or his phone, the corresponding Yoshi's power level rises. Several stats rise accordingly, these stats are:\n-speed\n-damage\n-knockback\n-defense\n-jump height\n-fireball rate of fire</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that shouting for an extended period of time is more effective than a single loud yell. This achieves more of a DragonBallZ effect and adds to the fun of the game.</p>\n<p>The screen also shakes when the shouting become intense enough.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/canvas\">canvas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["WildHacknSlash", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WildHacknSlash \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/331/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Sword duels are a tradition that has fallen out of the mainstream in recent times.

As team member Murphy Angelo said,</p>\n<p>\"I think that it's disappointing how there are a lot of cool games that people don't really play online, and that you can't really find anyone to play with locally. I wish there was an easier way to find people to play with.\"</p>\n<p>Fellow team members Elana Stettin and Ryan Hodin agreed with this sentiment, and thus GAMR was born.\nGAMR continues to this day to be funded entirely by donations.
