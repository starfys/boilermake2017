recently purchased the Bellabeat Leaf wearable, which tracks activity, breathing and steps, but is unable to track heart rate. After using the Leaf for a month, I've found that the deep breathing exercises are often the most relaxing part of my day. I've even begun the habit of deep breathing whenever I feel anxious, which often mutes any stirring anxiety. </p>\n<p>However, sometimes I don't notice I'm beginning a stress episode until it's too late.  Speaking to another KFTH attendee today, I realized that I'm not the only one who this happens to. In this day and age, we're all frequently overwhelmed by the kind of stress that scatters your thoughts, glitches your words and turns simple tasks into complex challenges.</p>\n<p>What's bothering anyone at the time of a stressful episode may be readily apparent emotionally, but it can be hard to pinpoint exactly at what point in the day you began going downhill, and what caused it. In addition, we often have biased perspectives of both our own actions and the actions of those around us that prevent us from seeing causation subjectively.</p>\n<p>Chopin is smart, subjective solution to living a calmer, slower life. Chopin will be able to track your stress levels and analyze what exactly is bothering you. Chopin will sense when you're beginning to get anxious, and gently remind you to slow down and take a breath. </p>\n<p>You'll be able to make more informed decisions, and finally be able to breathe again. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Chopin's \"pin\" is <strong>bandaged to the wrist by a strip of chiffon</strong>. Alternatively, the pin can be strapped to the Bellabeat Leaf so that the sensor rests against the skin, <strong>augmenting the wearable's functionality</strong>.</p>\n<p>The pin tracks your heartbeat, taking note of irregularities (speedups, slowdowns) and sending the data to the cloud to be analyzed. When your pulse quickens, Chopin will gently blink to indicate that you should slow down and do some deep breathing exercises.</p>\n<p>Chopin will provide reports on your most relaxed and most stressful moments. You'll be able to notice weekly, monthly and even seasonal patterns.  Integrating with google calendars, Chopin can even figure out what you were doing at the time. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Chopin's hardware consists of a heartrate moniter and LED attatched to a raspberry pi running Python.</p>\n<p>The script then regularly transmits data to the <strong>AWS cloud</strong> via MQTT messaging to be analyzed, and the user can use a web interface to review data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Configuring Chopin to communicate with my Amazon AWS instance was problematic and I was unable to finish it before the deadline.  In addition, the heartbeat moniter is sometimes overly sensitive and records movements as heartbeats.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I learned how to use the GPIO components of the Raspberry Pi and also taught myself how to put together basic circuits. Since there was no documentation, I reverse-engineered the pulse sensor (which was made for arduino) and was able to use it on the Pi. I learned how to provision an EC2 instance on Amazon and even began tackling the IoT framework.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I became intimately familiar with the raspberry pi, as well as it's GPIO.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Chopin</h2>\n<p>Once debugging post-hackathon, I would like to continue prototyping both the wearable and the app.</p>\n<p>For the wearable, I would like to keep it in a small encasing that easily attatches to fabrics and jewelry. It will use Bluetooth Low Energy to eventually communicate with a phone app to cut out the bulk of the pi. I would also prefer to replace the glowing light stress alarm with a soft vibration.</p>\n<p>In addition, Chopin's reporting capabilities willl expand beyond google maps. Chopin will one day look at social media posts, pictures, the news, and weather to suggest what may be bothering you and how to solve it. Chopin will also offer meditation and breathing exercises, during which your hearbeat and breathing will be tracked by the wearable to help establish progress and improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>I hope to see Chopin become a commercial product in the near future</strong>, so people like me and Dina can have <strong>help navigating the chaos of modern day life.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pulsesensor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bellabeat-leaf</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aiN7Uf1JxBzQRFwZrkXRGaOQTwm9OWqmb6O4_AvLHkA/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aiN7Uf1JxBzQRFwZrkXRGaOQTwm9OWqmb6O4_AvLHkA/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/k4therin2/Chopin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/k4therin2/Chopin\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["TransMitten", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TransMitten \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/339/335/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Hardware</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TransMitten \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/339/336/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Brainstorming</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TransMitten \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/576/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My hands were cold, and those thin one-size-fits-all gloves that enable screen touches arent warm enough.

By scanning the chip, they receive information about the item including price, an image, and a product description. Once payment has been confirmed, the RFID's security feature can be disabled by our application so that the user may take the item from the store.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Because we did not have access to RFID tags, we substituted in an electric-imp to simulate a tag. The electric-imp is linked to a URL, which upon visiting turns off the connected LED that symbolizes the activation of an RFID tag's security feature. We integrated this functionality within our app, so that we can remotely \"scan\" the item that the tag is associated with, and upon   We used an electric-imp, an Internet of Things platform. to communicate with our mobile device via wifi, Android Studio to build our mobile application, and Twitter Bootstrap to create our website.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was an arduous task to find a hardware solution that modeled an RFID tag compatible with our software. The hardware lab ran out of Arduino microcontrollers and bluetooth shields, so we experimented with a tiny-duino, several Intel Edison boards, which all for some reason refused to work with our computers. So after trying out seven different boards, we finally arrived at our savior: the electric-imp. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>All of us came in either rusty or inexperienced with Android. All of our UI skills received tons of practice, so much so that one of our team members initially with zero experience with Android Studio, was successfully helping build non-trivial parts of the application by the end of the project. We also all got some experience using the electric-imp!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/electric-imp\">electric-imp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JohnLinahan/Fashion-Tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JohnLinahan/Fashion-Tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cashtag.tech.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cashtag.tech.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cashtag.tech.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cashtag.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cashtag.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cashtag.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I chose the color scheme for our project, designed the app icon, and helped design the overall presentation of our work.

We feel that it is important to design products that solve problems, utilizing technology in order to assist in this process. By focusing on alleviating the pain and discomfort caused by menstruation, we seek to underscore the hidden challenges of womanhood. Ideally, through clever design, we hope to accomplish this goal without making those challenges any more visible to an outside observer.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our underwear functions as a covert, convenient, and drug-free way to seek relief from menstrual cramps and/or lower back pain. This undergarment can soothe the discomfort of the wearer though its self-contained heating pad from within a removable compression panel. This will ideally allow the wearer to continue with their daily activities that would have previously been disrupted. The heating element is accessible and adjustable through a free, downloadable mobile phone app. This app can also help track the menstrual cycle, giving the user a notification reminder a few days before their cycle is expected to begin.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This project came together in three parts: the garment, the hardware, and the software. Using an existing pair of underwear, we created and customized a pattern to better suit the needs of our product. Fabrics were carefully selected in order to make a comfortable and fashionable pair of underwear, utilizing innovative solutions to add in a smartphone-controlled compression and heating panel. The heating element for this piece came from Prometheus Technologies, who designed the 2Degree Jacket, which \u201cincorporates ultra-thin heating and power technology to allow the wearers to customize the jacket\u2019s temperature using an app installed on their smartphones or smart watch.\u201d Using technology from the hack rack in the fashion lab, we created a sleek device controller by connecting an Arduino Uno to a Low Energy Shield Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connects to a smartphone via an app. This app has a temperature on/off and control switch, sending data to the controller, which acts accordingly.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Despite our vision to create a product that would exist inside a pair underwear, no one on our team is fully competent with a sewing machine. This lack of expertise made the task of garment making quite daunting. We wanted to make a functional-yet-fashionable product as well, which involved the use of knit fabrics and lace, adding to the difficulty of our project. Collectively, our team also had no pattern making experience We relied on innovation and some helpful tips from mentors and fashion students to assist us through the pattern-making process. We were further challenged by the limitations of the supplies and tools we brought with us, in addition to the limited technical hardware that was provided by the Hackathon. There were a plethora of issues that came up during the software and hardware programming stages, too as we were working with a generally unfamiliar chip. Lastly, as a small group of diverse individuals, we encountered difficulties with our different styles of communication, working habits, and skill sets. There were more than a few instances where we were not on the same page as a group, and had to stop and catch up.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Before we started this project, we were all strangers to each other. Our group organically formed, by happenstance, with each of us having a different area of expertise. While the responsibilities for our collaboration were divided according to our individual skill-sets, we all came away from this project with new knowledge. Rachel now almost knows how the technology in our project works. Azim learned how to use the Serger machine and by the end of the project, and easily could have sewed almost the entire project because he\u2019s awesome. </p>\n<p>Rachel is especially proud of Azim and Charlie for being open to working on a project that aims to ease the experience of menstruation</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>All of us learned how to collaborate and trust the skills of each other, despite being strangers as of Friday. We overcame working outside of our comfort zones.</p>\n<p>Azim learned how to bridge between Objective-C and Swift, connecting Arduino Uno with Bluetooth shield to an iPhone, and how to use Serger machine.\nCharlie learned that there\u2019s almost always an easier solution to the problem at hand and  about how Bluetooth Low Energy works at a lower level.\nRachel learned that incorporating technology into wearable objects is not unattainable, as long as you are able to work with people who know how to do it. (She still barely know how the tech aspects of this project work.) Serger machines are not nearly as terrifying as they used to be, and she understands the basics of working with knit fabrics and creating patterns.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SmarterWear</h2>\n<p>We would like to continue to develop the app database, allowing for tracking of cycle variations, which can assist healthcare providers in analysis. This current design of undergarments is targeted towards females, but there are many other people who can benefit from this device, such as transgender men and people who have kidney stones or other health issues.</p>\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<p>Care, Compassion, Patience, Lack of Sleep, Caffeine, and Collaboration</p>\n<p>Non-Computer Tech Skills: pattern-making, Serger and standard sewing machines</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mac\">mac</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Quick Relations", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Quick Relations \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/363/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Process of printing the digital pattern</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Quick Relations \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/364/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The first Quick Relations garment as a finished product</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The outside QR pattern quickly takes those who scan it to the wearer's programmed site, be it Facebook for social media connections or a personal website for those who want business advertisements.

This way, the wearer can simply scan the inside code to find style combinations and suggestions professionally picked by a stylist.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We generated two separate QR codes. The outside code was incorporated into a digital pattern using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and printed using the digital printer in the TechStyle lab. The inside code would be printed as a tag. We then created a pattern, cut the fabric and sewed the garment.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to collaborate with the TechStyle lab in order to print a personalized digital pattern. We also learned to create QR codes.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Quick Relations</h2>\n<p>Quick Relations is an extremely accessible, interactive, wearable technology that customers can order from a website, collaborate with designers throughout the design process and wear with style, knowing it was combined with the best outfit choices possible. Quick Relations is a product that can easily be put on the market in the near future. Our product will start connecting people in both the social and business setting with the simple the scan of a pattern, while the wearer can simultaneously be assured they are taking advantage of the most stylish outfit combinations possible for their new Quick Relations garment. The QR links have endless possibilities in the apparel industry, aside from social media and being a \"wearable business card,\" Quick Relations can be incorporated into the work force. Hospitals can print personalized codes on patient hospital gowns with records and contact information. Possibilities for first response teams, the Armed Forces, etc are also vast. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/qr4-qr-code\">qr4-qr-code</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["HackShirt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackShirt \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/570/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does: ordering T-shirt</h2>\n<h2>How I built it: html webpage</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for HackShirt</h2>\n<p>We changed our project last night.\nOur team only had one Mac.</p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Fashion Application", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Fashion People</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Tell about clothes</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We build this app by using IOS sdk</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team was having only one mac that's the biggest challenge</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Coding in IOS</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>IOS PROGRAMMING</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fashion Application</h2>\n<p>NEXT SEMESTER</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-based-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["No More Unicorns", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvxPSgyjZyo?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"No More Unicorns \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/476/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Girls don't typically get their fair shot when it comes to computers and technology.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>They are easily programmable wearables designed to teach young children how to code in a fun, non intimidating way.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>tiny circuits, c++, java, android</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>time, Bluetooth capabilities</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>the quality of the wearables and software</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>designing clothing and accessories is extremely frustrating and difficult to do.</p>\n<h2>What's next for No More Unicorns</h2>\n<p>I work on tiny circuits for a living, so I absolutely plan to take these ideas back to the office and make them happen.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tiny-circuits</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I created the Android application that interfaced with the devices over Bluetooth.", ""]], ["LEDress", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LEDress \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/475/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>LEDress</h2>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong> -

the street on a cold day. You hear your phone ding. It is probably your sister. You have been waiting to hear her important news, but your phone is at the bottom of your purse. You stop in the middle of the sidewalk rummaging through your bag. You\u2019re so excited to see what she said that you almost forget your nose so cold it\u2019s about to fall off. You finally found your phone to see that it was just an email forward of the latest cat video. With the Notification Scarf this all could have been avoided.</p>\n<p>The Notification Scarf is a scarf with LEDs woven in to the structure. The LEDs are controlled through Bluetooth by an app on your phone. The scarf lights up when you receive a phone call for duration of the ringing and both the purple and red indicators are on.  When a text or email is received, the scarf flashes. A text will trigger the purple indictor and an e-mail will trigger the red indicator. The app also has a feature that allows the user to turn the lights on with their phone at their leisure, which could be utilized as a fashion statement or a safety feature when walking or biking in the dark. The scarf has been constructed with silk and cotton yarn and a continuous strand of LED lights woven into the structure.  The warp consists of an organic 2-ply cotton with a decorative stripe running through the length of the scarf and the woven weft is a combination of a finer mercerized cotton and reeled silk yarn to enhance the drape. The target market is women 25 to 45 who are on the go.

When working out one must be extremely careful to avoid dehydration. Anyone who is an avid workout junkie, a member of a sports team, or a marathon runner knows the danger that dehydration poses. With the tank top that we have created, dehydration can be prevented. The garment has been created with a polyspandex purple jersey knit with side panels of conductive gold fabric. According to Mayo Clinic, when your body temperature rises, your eccrine glands secrete fluid onto the surface of your skin, to cool your body as it evaporates\u2014this fluid being composed of mainly water and salt. This process takes the water from your body and slowly causes dehydration. So with our design an arduino device is connected to the conductive fabric to read the voltage levels that are triggered by perspiration. As the fabric is wetted with sweat, it creates a voltage difference that triggers the led light on a patch on the front of the exercise pouch. The yellow light on the front indicates that it is time to rehydrate. With this creation we hope to prevent the cases of hospitalization and even death that occur from exercise induced dehydration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">conductive-material</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">polyspandex</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ardiuno</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Theia", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Theia \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/339/516/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration I had problems as a biker, with people wearing headphones, and not aware of my presence</h2>\n<h2>What it does using sonar, it gives feedback to the box, vibrating faster and more frequently the closer it approaches an obstruction from 3 feet in</h2>\n<h2>How I built it, I connected the Ping to the arduino, developed code to measure space and give feed back every 1 second, then developed a ration code for the vibrator. then</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into Compacting everything into a sleek package, along with shorting the technology and having to get replacement.
