We had a good mix of technical and artistic abilities on our team so we decided to try to make an app for Phil Knight's 80th birthday basketball tournament. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app is an all-in-one experience for the PK80 tournament. We designed it to enhance the spectator experience by providing live coverage, directions to and from the venue and some of Portland's best Dining and Entertainment options. For those spectating from elsewhere, we ensured access to live scores was accessible, a window into the live twitter and news feed relevant to the team being cheered for from afar. We added social media features to entice younger users, but also kept the interface simple for older users as well.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started off by brainstorming a huge list of ideas for the app and what we wanted it to do. We also decided what demographic we wanted to target in order to maximize users and profit. Then, we started to build the foundations with Adobe Illustrator and Android Studio. Almost everyone in our group lacked experience in Android Studio, so we had to learn it on the fly. Our artists spent a lot of time designing a majority of the artwork in our app and the developers overcame many obstacles to reach a functional prototype.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the largest challenges we ran into was not having very much experience in Android development. It was a learning experience and we utilized mentors a great deal in order to get the most out of our time here. Another problem we ran into was only having one computer that could run Android Studio effectively, so it required us to work slower but also more collaboratively.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>For our developers, the greatest accomplishment was having a functional app by Sunday morning. At first we didn't think we had time to make anything but a linear demonstration, but after a lot of time developing, we made it so that you can go anywhere in the app at any time. Our artists were very proud of the work they did and the images turned out to be beautiful. They were able to make a stunning UI, even if we had to cut back on some features due to time constraints.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned how to be better team members and leaders. We coordinated ourselves really well and learned a lot along the way. We each had our specialty coming in, but through working together, we each learned something that's not even related to what we usually do. Whether it was business, tech, or art, we all learned something unique and the mentors taught us a lot along the way too.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PK80 App</h2>\n<p>The next steps for the PK80 app include presenting it to the judges today, adding more features and functionality, and using it as a tool to continue learning and improving our own skills.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/dropbox\">dropbox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-10\">windows-10</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">osx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Future Sport VR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Future Sport VR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/278/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The Game Environment </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Future Sport VR \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/250/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Developing in Unity </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Future Sport VR \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/255/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Oculus and Leap DUO</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Future Sport VR \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/260/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Developing with Echo </i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The Inspiriation was when in the opening ceremony we saw Ashton Eaton's cruthes, and realized how innaccesible things are in life.

EngageAble's systems detect when a key moment occurs in game and send a signal to the end user's device, which vibrates to alert them to the event.  Different moments are assigned different vibration patterns to help the fan differentiate.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The control signals which indicate key moments come from EngageAble's sensor systems.  There are two sensor systems available, the impact sensor and web app.</p>\n<p>The impact sensor is meant to be attached to athletes and equipment to detect significant impacts which coincide with key events.  The prototype impact sensor is built with an Intel Edison Arduino breakout board and a 3-Axis accelerometer.  The accelerometer is used to detect the fast acceleration that coincides with catching a ball and the Intel Edison's WiFi modem is used to transmit the event.</p>\n<p>The web app is made to identify those events which we cannot or have not made sensors for.  The web app provides an interface for venue operators to send out key events by hand, as they choose.  For example, it might be used in a baseball stadium to signal a home run.</p>\n<p>EngageAble's low latency networking system is built on top of the MQTT messaging protocol.  MQTT lets us \"publish\" a message and have it sent out to any number of \"subscribers\".  In our application the sensors act as publishers and the fans' devices act as subscribers.  A code is sent out specifying what event occurred and the subscribers react as is appropriate.</p>\n<p>The devices used by fans are readily available consumer electronics.  We have built Android and Pebble apps to be installed on fans' devices.  The Android app subscribes to the MQTT server and passes any events to the Pebble smart watch.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many difficulties when building the impact sensor.

Before we go on lets answer a very important question, why do people watch sports? Well, They thrive on competition, if half of the people watching could be out there playing they would, so lets give them something to play that will get them intimately invested in the game, entice them to stay the whole duration and keep them coming back for more. So how does it work? Imagine watching  UofO playing Oregon State, you open up Sideline showdown and a question pops up, \u201cWill UofO convert this 3rd down play for a first down?\u201d YES/NO? If you get the question right you earn points. Special questions will get you discounts at the concession stands. Note: you have to be within the radius of the stadium to participate. On the jumbotron theres a leader board for sideline showdown showing the top scores for the day. At the end of the day, Top 3 get a prize, and points accumulate over the season, at the end of the season, top 10 get special prizes and top 3 get to have dinner with the team. \nWhat does this accomplish?</p>\n<ol>\n<li> According to research, +50% of people would rather watch from home. SidelineShowdown brings people to the games, keeps them there for the entire game, and keeps them coming back.</li>\n<li> Audience feels invested in the game and are more likely to stay and feel included in another dimension of the </li>\n<li> Professional sports organizations are targeting the youth through social media, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach, we believe the solution is to give the youth something to post on their social media sites, fostering friendly competition between friends they can compete among one another by forming groups, this way the crowd is used to do the advertising, which will reach many more people than personalized social media sites.</li>\n<li> Sideline showdown also levels the playing field such that no one feels disadvantaged. For example when prizes are thrown into the audience, people with more expensive seats are usually winning those prizes. Sideline showdown gives everyone a fair chance.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We have a working prototype which can be tested on a demo board and for the future we hope to have a full functioning app. Our end goal is to take the design and pitch it to professional sports teams and enhance the modern fan experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/m364nm/clickpots\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/m364nm/clickpots\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Set up and co-developed the Admin Console to Sideline Showdown's web application.

Colleges are always looking for new opportunities for their teams to raise revenue and generate excitement.</p>\n<p>Solution</p>\n<p>Introducing: Icarus. There is existing apparel with built-in GPS technologies, designed to record athletes\u2019 stats and other data. Icarus interacts with similar technologies to seamlessly merge athlete performance with fan engagement in an experience unlike any other. Our jersey contains integrated LED strips that dim and brighten based on happenings in the game. Athletes\u2019 jerseys light up in response to measurables like speed and acceleration. We believe this visualization of data in the player's jersey will aww fans and will give a new meaning to speed kills. The data is accessible through the user friendly app with statistics from that game including the top speed for each individual player and the \u2018play\u2019 or \u2018performance\u2019 of the game. \nProblem</p>\n<p>Following the hype surrounding the unveiling of the player jersey, stadium goers will be able to purchase a replica (includes the LED system without the data collecting technology) at the following home game(s). In hopes to coordinate a flash mob esque event, we envision using the fans\u2019 jerseys to illuminate the stadium for big plays and touchdowns in eye catching displays.</p>\n<p>Market Size</p>\n<p>We believe our initial market to be the University of Oregon football fans which will eventually expand to all Ducks sports. Considering the undergraduate enrollment of 24,125, we expect considerable market traction. However, our total addressable market uses the capacity of Autzen Stadium, 63,000. Successfully capturing this market will give us considerable momentum in expanding to other schools, other sports, and eventually the professional level. </p>\n<p>Business Model</p>\n<p>We will partner with Nike, with a typical 60/40 retail distributor deal, to ensure our jerseys are the best quality and are given a proper introduction into the sports landscape. Creating a jersey for the players serves as initial advertising before creating replicas available for the sports consumer. Fan jerseys will be priced higher than most jersey replicas. A higher quality football jersey replica ranges from $80 - $100. The Icarus line would be priced at $165 per unit. However, to encourage fan attendance to home games, the jersey is only made available at the stadium for the premier Light Up event. Following the reveal, the jersey will then be sold at all Duck Stores and even online. Given the Light Up game demonstrates an interest in tech integrated apparel tethered to a mobile interface, Icarus will then expand business into other sports arenas like soccer, hockey, basketball, baseball, and others. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solder</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Ekin", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Matthew was enthusasitic to work with the hardware featured here. Months ago, he was in an accident that required physical therapy, and so he wanted to focus on something that could help athlete injuries. When the team met together, we knew right away we wanted to focus on athlete enchacement, so we brainstormed several ideas. Matthew was a former varsity track runner, so the team decided to focus on something that could help a runner's form. That's how we eventually arrived at the Ekin, the insole gait analysis tool.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Ekin is designed to observe and analysis the running form of the user. It is equipped with technology that allows it to sense where a user's foot is emphasized during normal gait and running form. It compiles the data to a web page that the user can review to better understand their form.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Ekin is divided into 3 fundamental pieces: the analysis equipment, the data visualization/viewing application, and the model and fastener.\nRui and Andy set to work on getting the analysis equipment up and running. The Ekin required portability, since it was to be affixed to a walking medium. They decided to use an Arduino matched with a bread board and pressure pad. \nMatthew and Zach began development on the analysis visualizer, with Zach running the client-side webpage and Matthew handling the back-end data storage. Zach used focused on his strengths, which included HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (with a focus on node.js). Matthew learned a few new tools, and implemented a couple old ones, when he set up the Apache server on AWS and attached it to a database using MongoDB.\nAlex focused on the model for the device, using a range of craft tools to construct a model to fasten the device to.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Once the pieces were working independently, we had issues putting them all together. The analysis equiment (Arduino) was designed to communicate through Bluetooth wireless signal. However, our viewing application server (Apache) required HTTP POST in order to communicate over Bluetooth, something that no one on the team had a firm understanding of. Matthew soon figured out that Apache had no way to communicate through POST, and he quickly typed up his own web server. \nLater on in development, we discovered that the scope of our project had spread the team thin, weakening areas that needed to be addressed. The data visualization application was enormously difficult to bring together, when it needed to be connected to the Arduino, the database, and the web server. This was the team's most difficult challenge and took multiple people (Matthew, Rui, and Zach) working together to hash out the details and finally get the visualization tool up and running. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The model was one successful endeavor that we are proud of. Matthew in particular expresses pride in its form and achievement. Alex is also proud of the model. \nRui is proud of his persistence and endurance, going so far as drinking 12 Red Bulls in 2 days!\nAndy is proud of his achievement in setting up the Bluetooth capabilities of the Arduino, especially concerning his unfamiliarity with it. \nZach is proud of his state-of-the-art design decisions regarding the web page.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Matthew found the experience rewarding, discovering that although he can do many things in Python, that isn't always the case. Alex learned that he had quite the knack for crafts and what it means to stay awake 24+ hours working. Rui learned that League of Legends has split-screen mode. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Ekin</h2>\n<p>We have plans to make Ekin into a legitimate product, but we careful considerations for the technology we produce it in. For example, the Arduino doesn't have WiFi capabilities, which was an initial desire. The sensory technology we used could have been easier depending on the equipment, so those decisions need to be reevaluated. The web application needs to be expanded, ideally including a user login and more comprehensive data analysis. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">littlebit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">resistor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">breadboard</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">foam</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/canvas\">canvas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">insole</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">duct-tape</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wires</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows\">windows</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mac-osx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heatmap\">heatmap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">multimeter</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">soldering-iron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">alienware</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hot-glue</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sewing-kit</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jagielski/quackcon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jagielski/quackcon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Setup the AWS server.

About half of the population rather watch their games from the comfort of their home than get the fun and physical experience of live sporting events. As sports biggest fan we will have none of it!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app focuses on fan engagement and revenue. We like to keep the game fun. We also like to keep it interactive. Our app allows the management of polling your stadium fans (Who was the MVP this game? How well do you know Portland Blazers?, etc.) or run raffles to raise money for a charity, organization or both! </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Consistency was our number #1 goal. This is why we went with a full stack mobile web app that would have the same robust and UI feel regardless of where and when you access it. We used various technologies to make this idea into a reality. Nodejs, SQL, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Xamarin, Android, iOS, and honestly the list will go on. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Most of us were absolute beginners to lots of the technologies we covered in this hackathon. We never got uncomfortable with the idea and used it as an opportunity to learn something fun and new. We reached lots of dead ends, lots of head banging, and hair pulling, but we pushed on into creating our complete and working full stack app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made something awesome! Is it a full complete working application that can now be used by millions of users? No. We needed 20 more minutes for that.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Lots! We loved the idea of using technologies we never even heard or were familiar with.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hyped!</h2>\n<p>Exactly! Why leave Hyped where it is? We did an awesome thing in just 2 days. Imagine the possibilities we could do in a whole week. A month? A year? WOW! We want to make Hyped be reached to any sport fan and get them excited one again. GET HYPED!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xamarin\">xamarin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tochiton/Hyped\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tochiton/Hyped\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped with the back end, design, and business side of the full stack development.
