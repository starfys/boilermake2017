Great. Now you have to pay an immense fee because you had to take care of other responsibilities. You, trying to help that old lady cross the street, which delayed you just a few minutes. Life isn't fair, but you know what, it can be a bit better with the Meter Beater Club. Now there's one less thing to worry about.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When you get out of your car, just whip out your phone or open up the app on your watch. Pay the meter and say how long you paid for. If your car is still around the area at the time of expiration, either the Meter Beater community or somebody looking to score some easy cash will feed the meter for another hour for a small fee. So no more pesky parking tickets to fuss about and more time for you to live your life the way you want.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Its a three part app - the watch and iOS app work together for the parker and a companion webapp for community club members. We spun up a backend heroku app project with Java/Spring as the backend. Split the work into four parallel parts, one back-end, one apple watch, one iOS app, and one webapp partner portal. Stubbed out data to work with in the beginning, then later filled it in with working end-points and data sources. Pieced it all together at the end to create an incredible experience.</p>\n<p>By utilizing arcGIS, we provide a map display with routing to find the best path to take for any community club member planning to help out a few needy souls.</p>\n<p>With weather-underground, we provide an added benefit for members that are helping in poor weather conditions. Think like surge charging, except we take the cut instead of the club members.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into (What I learned)</h2>\n<p>EC2 instances went down, which meant heroku went down. We readily swapped to using a local server which the four of us shared and worked off of.\nSetting up a server is a pain in the butt. Lots of technical details to work on.\nLearning a new language is always fun, but also difficult.\nThere are a lot of APIs out there in the world, which isn't a bad thing. But having so many APIs that do the same thing but with different terminology is a huge headache. Adds huge friction to development. And having a \"simple\" API to have a 15+ step process to just start using shouldn't really be \"simple\".</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Beat the EC2 downtime by creating a local environment working off of an iPad hotspot</p>\n<h2>What's next for the Meter Beater Club</h2>\n<p>Full integration with payment systems to make a seamless process from start to finish.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ios-swift</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/weather-underground\">weather-underground</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/magnet\">magnet</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/karen-ho/meterbeater\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/karen-ho/meterbeater\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://meterbeater.club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://meterbeater.club/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>meterbeater.club</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Trump This!

Incidents happen when parents are not alert, and we wanted to find a solution for that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Parents designate an activity zone that their child is allowed to be in.

We use the ESRI iOS sdk as well as Magnet. ESRI maintains the polygon for the geofence, and child-parent communication between the devices is handled via a Magnet chat room. The child device sends GPS coordinates to the parent, which the parent device checks against the established geofence (Activity Zone).</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We are not iOS developers, so a completely native app was scary. There were some technical challenges in getting geographic coordinates mapped correctly as well as using Magnet's messaging in a creative way to fit our needs. One we got those challenges straightened out, our only problem was lack of familiarity!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re proud that this native iOS app actually works, looks good, and has a simple user experience. We focused on ease-of-use so that parents can spend less time fiddling with devices and more time being confident that their kids are safe.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>With ESRI, we learned about their awesome API for native objective-C apps and the difference between two types of geographic coordinate systems. With Magnet, we learned about their inter-communication library. We also grew our skills on objective-C and iOS development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Happy Parent Club</h2>\n<p>Next, we want to create a smaller device for the child to carry in order to lower the cost of entry to this product.

proud of:</h2>\n<p>Walmart Simple Text can help Walmart customers with the following </p>\n<p>Can track usage of feature\nCan save time and money on hiring service associates because of automatic response. \nCan provide faster assistance to customers\nSMS is very basic phone functionality and easy for customers to understand and use</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that Walmart Labs has a great API that is kept up to date with a lot of rich and useful information that is easy to implement. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Walmart Simple Text</h2>\n<p>Targeting customers with in-store promotions (coupons) associated with keywords they search for (i.e. typing in the keyword \"dogfood\" will not only show available dogfood at their store but also what the prices are and current

Especially when the mechanic tells you that you could have prevented this costly repair if you had done it sooner. If I knew I would have done it sooner, but there is no one telling me that I needed that specific maintenance. That is why we are developing Car Sight</p>\n<p>It is an application for Ford Company, Dealers and owners. The project is using internet of things, machine learning and predictive and prescriptive analysis to foresee car failures before they happen. There are two aspects to this project. The first part is the android app that syncs with Ford Sync. The app has the intelligence to record driving behaviors to predict what type of maintenance is needed. Users will receive a notification of what maintenance is needed due to what driving behavior. </p>\n<p>For the company and dealers, the information recorded from the new app is valuable information. Using Machine learning models, utilizing predictive and prescriptive models, and real time data from the Ford Sync dealers can observe the behavior of their vehicles. Then recommend service based on driving behavior. This is a powerful tool that can transform this data into powerful analytics that can help not only Ford owners, but as well dealers. Dealers have the power to see potential maintenance needed on the car and recommend their service department to fix it.   </p>\n<p>The application was built with android studio and the machine learning models were built on Microsoft Azure ML.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating different companies APIs onto the android application. As well as gathering all the data to build the predictive analytic dashboard that utilizes machine learning models.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Created a successful application that syncs directly to Ford's Sync and designed a machine learning model that could predict driving behavior. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Working on this project the team and I learned how to work together to get a project completed. Also we had the opportunity to learn about the different technologies offered by the sponsors and brainstorming how it could all fit together into one  project. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Car Sight</h2>\n<p>Continue refining the application and adding more features to it.

Sometimes you just wish there was someone who could simplify the whole process for you and take you through it. Well, now there is. Meet Jobot \u2013 the world's first chatbot job consultancy.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a WeChat chatbot that asks the user a series of questions to determine best company fit. It uses IBM Watson for processing and user personality insights like culture fit and sentiment analysis. It then searches through its database of companies to find one that's right for you, and reaches out to them on your behalf. Simple \u2013 just as it should be. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Rivescript, an artificial intelligence scripting language to build the core conversation logic, and then submitted REST requests to IBM Watson for analysis.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest hurdle was getting the chatbot to work on WeChat, honestly. Once we figured that out, though, it was smooth-sailing from then on.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we proud of</h2>\n<p>We actually got some sleep at a hackathon. I know, I know \u2013 hold the applause. Also, we'd met each other at the hackathon itself, and managed to work together pretty well. I think that's a pretty phenomenal feat.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Chatbot scripting. It is a fascinating niche in technology that hasn't really been explored in depth. We are eager to delve deeper into it and discover new ways to use AI in our everyday lives.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Jobot</h2>\n<p>With 1.1 BILLION users on WeChat, we can safely say there are great things in store. People already have chat integrated into their daily lives \u2013 we plan to capitalize on that.</p>\n<p>Tech-wise, we plan to buff up the analytics, so companies can use Jobot as a prescreening measure for their initial interview processes. This will allow them to save both time and money by filtering out applicants who might not be a good fit for the company or position. We also plan to install an admin dashboard for companies to keep track of their potential applicants, with possible integrations with other talent platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rivescript</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wechat\">wechat</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://jobot.club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://jobot.club/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>jobot.club</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["It was fun to integrate the watson APIs into a service like WeChat that has so many potential users.", "", ""]], ["techkno.club", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>People in the tech industry who aren't technical need a better way to learn technology.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>two sided marketplace for tech explanations\ntech: system for ranking user submitted entries</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Slowly at first, then recklessly fast.

It understands what you mean not what you say about the multimedia in your personal collection.  We also made special efforts to support Dolby audio for cleaning up content descriptions and background noise.  There is not limit to the length a customer can annotate content, more is better in this case.</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into:</h2>\n<p>The test was dealing with the issues of Watson training and speech enabling the browser experience across operating systems, browsers and codecs.  We utilized encoding.com for trans-coding of several flavors of the same file permitting users to organize content easier than with using Tags or their poor mouse finger.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of:  Protecting anonymity and privacy for our users.

Each person at the dinner table scans the QR code, which then takes them to our web app and through the bill splitting process. As people select their items, we update the receipts for everyone in real-time to show who got what. The real-time updates are made possible through a two-way communication with Firebase.

We then decided to create both a mobile and desktop web app. The mobile app focused on the the victims of the disaster, allowing them to post what was happening and how they needed help. The web app would then notify community members about information happening in that disaster in real time. When implementing, we decided to use Esri\u2019s ArcGIS API and Android SDK for location data and map data visualizations, which are both key to our applications. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We tried using the beta version of ArcGIS Javascript API, but some features we needed were not yet fully supported because the beta is still a work in progress. </p>\n<p>We were hosting our API on Heroku, but it went down around 4am, making it too unstable for connecting our application.

It became difficult to scale down, and we ended up pivoting many times in less than 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even though Heroku went down, we are proud of building a functional API service connected to a PostgreSQL database.\nUser centered design. We focused designing on user driven application flow for a victim to easily interact with in a high stress situation. We heavily referred to HCI guidelines and used HCI methodologies in designing before coding.</p>\n<p>With material design still relatively new, we\u2019re proud of being able to integrate a lot of material-style UI and \nConnecting with an external API and learning to read and use their documentation</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How useful external API\u2019s are and how to read and use external documentation.\nWe wanted to save the world, but there is only so much you can do in less than 24 hours...</p>\n<h2>What's next for test</h2>\n<p>Continue building on the web portion of our project. Ensure community members can be aware and to act on the local disasters in order to provide direct relief such as volunteering, providing food and water. We will want to spend more time on more robust map data visualization and connecting the social medium to our application. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\" https://github.com/jaytolentino/haven-android\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" https://github.com/jaytolentino/haven-android\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/truongmm/haven-web\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/truongmm/haven-web\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\" https://github.com/truongmm/haven-api\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" https://github.com/truongmm/haven-api\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["git2docker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"git2docker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/161/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"git2docker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/162/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"git2docker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/163/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"git2docker \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/164/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Keeping Docker releases up to date with Git releases today is a very manual process. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Creates an automated pipeline from git through testing to a Docker Registry.

Many people struggle with mood swings and fluctuations brought on by changes in the weather. Everything from everyday feelings to Seasonal Affective Disorder and depression can be affected by changes in our environment. What if people had more awareness and control over the patterns in their mood and looked out for warning signs in the future?</p>\n<p>Using the power of social media, natural language processing, and the wealth of weather information on the web today, we can mash up a variety of data sources. Using Hack My Mood, users can track the sentiment of their tweets over time, and relate that to the weather in their area that day. </p>\n<p>We believe that awareness is the first step to better mental health, and by educating people on the patterns that arise in their own writing, we can build a happier, healthier world.</p>\n<h2>APIs Used:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>IBM-Watson Alchemy API</p></li>\n<li><p>Weather Underground</p></li>\n<li><p>Twitter</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Results:</h2>\n<p>At least on my tweets, it does appear that sentiment drops slightly as temperature drops.

Somewhere to find hardware solutions and request what I want.</p>\n<p>I searched for hardware that works and was not a toy, learning the mobile side with more then simple examples that never work or are outdated and getting my hands on everything I need. For the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2015 Hackathon I wanted to create this solution as a market place with a hardware based kit to start with everything you need and make a few sample projects.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The hardware kit consist of an Anduino controller with Bluetooth (BLE) as well as a Relay board and input board. With these base components you can get many projects working. There is also a seed of software that can be used to control basic devices using relays and get basic sensor input with an Input Board.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The development consisted of assembling the boards together and writing software for iOS and the hardware device. This software consisted of C and Objective-C with communications of BlueTooth for the communications.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Many of the samples online are outdated or simply wrong. Getting the hardware was the simple part, the Objective-C software for iOS was fairly simple but then I have been working on iOS for 8 years now. The device software was much more complicated, in as far as technical challenge but as far as getting firmware that worked with the correct chip-set and other devices.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting the boards together was simple, getting them to work together was a challenge, understanding what version of software and chips was hard but once I completed this task I felt that I had accomplished something that I needed to share with others.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that what appears simple is never so. Getting hardware from so many sources and making it work together is time consuming.</p>\n<h2>What's next for IoT Fun Source</h2>\n<p>I hope I can present my completed project at the Techcrunch Disrupt Hackathon SF 2015. I hope to make people aware of what I am working on and share what I have done. Getting others to see what I have done and to contribute work will make a true market place that does not exist today.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["360FX", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"360FX \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/858/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A lot of people enjoy adding filters / effects to regular photos, 360 degree photos / video could use the same thing!

First, there are significant costs associated with furniture, appliances and linens (approximately $15,000-30,000 for a 1-bedroom condo).  Second, there are several service needs such as housekeeping, handy maintenance and even interior decorating. Third, there are food provisions such as coffee and milk that need to be regularly restocked.

How about an interior decorator to help you stage your property? Perhaps a property manager who delivers keys and troubleshoots issues for guests?

Again, book these services through HostUp and we will automatically add these items to a running list of tax-deductible expenses that seamlessly integrates with Xero or Quickbooks.</p>\n<p>Users can even scan receipts of property-related expenses incurred outside of HostUp and we will categorize these expenses and leverage this data to recommend great deals from our merchant partners, such as terry-cloth bathrobes from Zalando or a bulk order of discounted toilet paper from Walmart.

A lot can be done with Vinli's API that gives us valuable information about the user's automobile, while APIs like Weather Underground and Outlook's calendar API serve as providers for user's day to day activities. Esri's ArcGIS platform remains one of the top players in the domain of GIS. On top of that we also wanted to work with something that will help us validate our deployment. To give a facelift for our application we choose something cool for hosting like .club</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This Application improves the user's automobile experience by enabling direct notifications of calendar events and translate them to routes navigating to the user's destination while providing quick and yet, in-depth peek at the car's dashboard of the car and road weather condition. </p>\n<p>Gives you more vital information about your automobile than its dashboard. Enables you to route places without on the fly. Provides navigation with one of the best navigation service providers. Gives you details about your travel like the automobile condition the roadside weather conditions, and picks everything up from your calendar. We are also allowing the users to get the best information about the gas stations around him/her based on automobile condition.</p>\n<p>Our App enables Esri's navigation through the events on the Outlook's calendar API. Gives you intrinsic information about your ride and natural obstacles while providing the user capability to save and retrive information about their previous rides. We're not just making an app, we're innovating the way users look at their cars.</p>\n<p>We're making an Application that embeds itself into the day to day life of the user enabling them to simplfy their journeys in life. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>AFNetworking through cocoa pods helped us simplify the service calls. We're planning on fully building our app around a full fledged integration of Vinli's mutli-nation hardware distribution channel when we ship. We're also mocking and integrating the Microsoft's Outlook Calendar API.  We're using Weather Underground's HTTP GET request to give useful weather updates through the user's route.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating the Vinli API and working with their simulator was one challenge as the simulator enacted a real time deriver software integration a bit challenging. auto mobile tracker.

By correlating the two, it reports down to earth advice in a conversational style to help the user learn about their habits. For example, if we find high levels of alpha waves while the user is browsing Youtube, we may suggest that they browse Youtube to relax when they're feeling stressed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The system is primarily built around the Cloudbrain API (<a href=\"http://getcloudbrain.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://getcloudbrain.com</a>), which allows the streaming of Muse brainwave data and the tagging of correlate events.

These uploads can be done using two modes:\na) Auto Share - The camera goes into a burst upload mode i.e. whatever picture the user clicks, it is automatically uploaded to the event bucket, of course with the user's consent!\nb) Instant Share - The camera goes into a \"Approve Before Load\" mode i.e. whatever picture the user clicks, he/she is asked to approve, before it's uploaded to the event bucket.</p>\n<p>Family and friends can subscribe to these buckets (by Invite only) to receive photos and videos in real time as they are being created.

It can sense things like temperature, light and moisture, and send that data to your phone over bluetooth. Plus, it is fully powered by solar energy!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We got an Arduino board, and connected a bluetooth module, RGB LED, and sensors for temperature, moisture, and light. We wanted everything to be solar powered so we got a charger board optimized for solar charging and hooked it up to a LiPo battery.</p>\n<p>The software component of WisePlant is an Android app that reads sensor values through bluetooth and visualizes the current state of the plant, with an emphasis on what the plant needs. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Soldering for the first time was a big challenge. We wanted our device to be packaged nicely, so we spent some time to build a custom-soldered breadboard to drive the sensors.</p>\n<p>Also, finding the right components to make solar work was challenging. We wanted to use green energy and did not want any wires to be sticking out of the plant. So we had to get the right voltage for the Arduino board, get a battery that can draw enough current for all the components, and a controller board that optimizes the charging process.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We\u2019re proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we learned hardware fast (both of us are software people), and integrated it with software that resulted in a very responsive experience. The second there is a change in the physical environment, you see that on your app. We are also proud that this all runs on solar!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Hardware rocks! Prototyping with hardware has become way easier with open source projects like Arduino. Where is gets complicated is when you want to balance a lot of functionality with a simple and small package. For example, we had to make sure that all our sensors are 3.3V compatible because a 5V Arduino required a battery and a solar panel that were too big.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WisePlant</h2>\n<p>We would like to add Wifi to WisePlant so we can send an SMS (with Twilio) telling you if the plant needs watering, light, etc, regardless of your location.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">appengine</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solar</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">moisture-sensor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">temperature-sensor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">light-sensor</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sssaylin/WisePlant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sssaylin/WisePlant\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Health365.club", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><strong>Health365.club</strong>  ##</p>\n<p>Health365.club wearable monitoring textile and mobile app that monitors, send data to doctor &amp; connects w/loved ones/supporters</p>\n<p>Preventable medical errors are the No. 3 killer in the U.S. \nIt is third only to heart disease and cancer, claiming the lives of more than 750,000 people each year.<br/>\n1,000+ deaths per day. </p>\n<p>There's also the 10,000+ serious complications cases resulting from medical errors that occur daily. \nOne of the more significant issues relating to medical errors involves missed and delayed diagnoses.\nStatistics show the shocking extent of post-operative side-effects, drug-induced illness, illness or injury caused by medical intervention as well.</p>\n<p>When medical intervention cripples personal responses to pain, disability, impairment, anguish, then the patients go numb and let themselves go even to fatal death.</p>\n<p>These medical errors cost the nation a colossal about $2 trillion each year through the direct and indirect cost of pain annually.</p>\n<p>The IT systems need to be designed to better manage and have better results, but it isn\u2019t at this time.</p>\n<p>What it does</p>\n<p>Health365.club is a wearable monitoring textile system and mobile app that sends data to the doctor to see the progress of the out-patient by having the patient submit their data, photos and notes directly.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>While car telemetry and location data is deemed sensitive, it's use in triggering customize-once-and-automate IFFT-style seamless actions amongst trusted family members cannot be discounted and resonate with family members. \"notify the parents automagically when the new teen-driver revvs up  engine RPM beyond specification or  overspeeds\", \"notify a spouse when they are delayed at work or stuck in traffic\", \"read aloud a kids wishlist in the car as he approaches a store\" are few scenarios that come to mind. \nAn overarching design consideration was the app/geolocation triggers had to function even in the absence of speacialized car data gathering hardware -- such as the OBD-II can bus module or the ford sync3 platform which are still in their early adoption phase when compared to the abundance of smartphones that people carry with them almost 24/7 and never leave home without.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Several Geolocation and car data rules are setup by indvidual family members and downloaded to a smart phone that invoke the actions when the cutomize-and-automate rules are tripped</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The ideation, design and integration of the various sponsor platforms/technologies were all done in the span of 16 hours by the team of three developers -- Lance Nanek, Henry Chang and Anand Setlur</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the various credentials setup and operational to access the various partner platforms -- began with domain.com signon challenges, vinli credentials, applink appid permission issues and integration of the various disparate pieces to form a single cohesive story that will resonate with a wide-audience.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Proud that this is a useful service in that I endorse it, since data stays within the family and I will likely use well past the hackathon</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Hackathons are an excellent way of meeting and collaborating with creative engineers/designers  and the sum is always greater than the individual parts. </p>\n<h2>What's next for CarDataIFTT</h2>\n<p>We have registered a domains thecardata.club and thecardata.com and intend to continue to refine the use cases so they simplify and automate more scenarios in people's daily lives as the world becomes more connected/complicated.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a

DreamList is created to aggregate your future purchases, charity contributions, project fundraising, registries, savings accounts and any other expenses you expect in one place - so anyone who wants to help you can do so easily and meaningfully. Now, instead of Toys'R'Us we can direct friends who want to send gifts for our children to a savings fund that distributes contributions across a selection of tech stocks. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Dreamlist provides an environment of social encouragement for people to save for big expenses - such as college, cars, vacations, or homes, or other things they find meaningful.  It also shows what people give to charities and the needy.  Ultimately every user has a profile of the things he or she is saving up for.  Users largely contribute to their goals individually, but others are encouraged to help when it makes sense.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Postgres, Heroku, Stripe, .CLUB . We want to aggregate a financial savings tool and registry/merchandising inventory from each user's registries as well. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Heroku, our main host, was down for more than 5 hours out of the 20 hour hackathon. Fortunately, we deployed early, but it is still down as of this submission. Please, let us show you our local version for judging, if needed.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>DreamList has a lot of monetisation opportunities - from referral bonuses, to shares of transactions, to positive cash-flow, to vendor promotion opportunities, and other revenue channels. In less than 20 hours we were able to create a basic prototype, demo to friends and family and receive confirmation that there is demand for such a product. </p>\n<h2>What's next for DreamList</h2>\n<p>Built a fully functional prototype.</p>\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dreamlist.club\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.dreamlist.club</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">devise</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stripe\">stripe</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mastercard\">mastercard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">zelando</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dreamlist.club\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.dreamlist.club\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dreamlist.club</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Quarry", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Quarry \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/296/168/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>The search experience on e-commerce sites are stuck in the past. They utilize basic text matching and category matches but ignores all of the product metadata and user insights that e-commerce sites have access to.</p>\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n<p>We built the autocomplete brain and you plug into us.  Our team has in the past, built a similar autocomplete system for a hotel search company, which boosted conversion tremendously.  We realized that it is a feature that many e-commerce companies do not have the time to invest in. Our autocomplete service takes all of the product metadata and filters available from your e-commerce site and intelligently chooses the ones that work best for your shopper's queries.</p>\n<h2>What we built at SF Disrupt 2015</h2>\n<p>A proof of concept of what Quarry could do using the Walmart Open API for an initial data set.  We connected our backend autocomplete API to a Google Chrome extension, so we could demo our autocomplete on top of Walmart.com.</p>\n<p>Here is a side-by-side comparison of our autocomplete vs the existing autocomplete on Walmart.com:</p>\n<h3>Autocomplete plugged into Quarry's API</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Us\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.yoquarry.club/oursearch.png\"

autocomplete are linked to directly to Walmart.com with the correct filters applied, whereas the existing autocomplete mainly uses a text comparison to grab the top results.</p>\n<h2>Future goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Generalize how we store data so we can partner with more sites</li>\n<li>Integrate user analytics to surface the most popular searches</li>\n<li>Enhance autocomplete matching

Drug related morbidity and mortality was estimated  to be $177.4 billion and rising in the US. There are many research resources for researchers in this field, but they have never been together and as easily accessible until now.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The drug safety market is huge (drug related morbidity and mortality was estimated to be $177.4 billion and rising in the US). Most people won't read all the box indications, the FDA website for adverse reports, or even simplified resources like drugs.com or drugbank, which often need some expert level knowledge to interpret. We aggregate research literature, FDA information, and publicly available data sets and resources to facilitate the advancement of the field.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Send small query, we will identify which drugs you are talking about and send you/provide you with a page that find all research literature involving the drug(s) and adverse effects. We even take this further and search a highly specialized curated resource that contains multiple leading drug interaction prediction methods and score the drug-drug association based on 6 different sources of information. All this work is publicly available and under publication in the leading journals.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Combining all my day job experience with the desire of hacking things together, this resource combines 6 different APIs and 6 different pharmacovigilance datasets to provide a comprehensive overview of drug interactions and adverse events.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Drug name normalization is a nightmare... I have spent months of my life addressing this problem in my day job.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Combines multiple resources that have never been available in one single place via API calls, no need to install huge datasets locally. The level of expertise in the field to be able to put all these resources together has been a challenge in the last year of my life (after switching fields from solar informatics!!!), it all finally comes together in one nice and sleek product.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Tons of drug safety domain knowledge and technical know-how to combine resources in an efficient and clean way.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Drug Safety Portal</h2>\n<p>Add more research data sources, improve API connectivity and full integration with bio2rdf resources</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sparql</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/curl\">curl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jmbanda/DrugSafetyPortal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jmbanda/DrugSafetyPortal\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://s113291353.onlinehome.us/TCD/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://s113291353.onlinehome.us/TCD/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>s113291353.onlinehome.us</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["creator and data source curator"]], ["Ahead", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ahead \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/361/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ahead \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/362/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ahead \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/301/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ahead \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/303/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Many people, like myself, prefer to place order in advance and when I arrive at the restaurant they like to get freshly made meal without any delay or without food is being cooled-down.</p>\n<p>Similarly, restaurant owners would also prefer to prepare and serve meals in a most efficient manner instead of first-come-first-serve basis.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Ahead</strong> allows consumer to place order and let the store/restaurant owner know exactly when the consumer is <em>heading out</em> to the restaurant. </p>\n<p>At the same time <strong>Ahead</strong> enables merchants/restaurant owners to start preparing meals, or orders, and serve their customer with freshly prepared meal, without any delays.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built consumer app for iOS app using Swift - not very fancy but enough to place order and do <em>'Heading out now'</em>.</p>\n<p>Then built a server side script to receive orders and location (<em>'Heading out'</em>) info from consumer which is then sent as notifications to the Merchant (store owner) <em>Ahead</em> app on Clover. </p>\n<p>On the Clover side (android tablet), the app receives notification and shows the order details.

Those moments come and then go quickly.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Re-live.Your.Rides allows Ford drivers to record their trips (including location, telemetry information) using simple menu item on Ford AppLink system or voice command \"Record View\".  Once finished, drivers can playback their rides using the app.  It uses the recorded data to recreate the experience using StreetView.  </p>\n<p>We also made it easy to share the video with friends on social networks such as facebook, YouTube or Twitter.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>After ideation, we created a low-fidelity user experience mockup on paper, as well as an application architecture diagram to identify the required components and how they interact with each other.  We quickly created a new github repo and Slack channel for asset sharing.   Maria started creating UX assets, Sean focused on the AppLink integration while Billy started drafting the iOS ViewControllers and assembling the necessary framework components through CocoaPods.</p>\n<p>Along the way, we integrate each piece to identify weaknesses in our storytelling and re-prioritize.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>User Interface:  Overlaying the gauge, map and other elements on top of the Street View visualization was challenging.  After many failed attempts, we managed to achieve a translucent user experience that is both useful and visually appeasing.</p>\n<p>AppLink:  Documentation and sample code were in very early stages.  Frequent consultation with Ford developers was critical.  TDK and simulators still had some work to do to enable a smooth developer experience.  Debugging on iOS with TDK was proven to be tricky because the phone could not be connected to the TDK and Xcode at the same time.  This had made things a lot harder than it had to be.  Fixes and bug fixing without a step-by-step debugger and console output was hard.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were very pleased to be able to go from conceptual sketches to an integrated working prototype that included integration with Ford AppLink, TDK Development Kit, Google StreetView and LMGauges.  The team had limited access to latest Ford libraries, simulators and documentation before the event.  It was challenging and yet satisfying.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>In-car application is highly promising and untapped.  It's still in very early stages and very close interactions with OEM manufacturers will be the key to quality delivery.   Internationalization is going to be a significant challenge as well.  Drivers' expectations on in-car apps will be much higher than other consumer apps.  It cannot crash and has to work as reliably as the car itself.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for \"Re-live.Your.Rides\"</h2>\n<p>We intend to share the prototype with Ford development teams to access the potential and opportunities in this space.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sdl\">sdl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ford\">ford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zcr1cmUsHV7eBC6cLhf03vVuHCicRae83uFc-2l7uGs/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Zcr1cmUsHV7eBC6cLhf03vVuHCicRae83uFc-2l7uGs/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the mashup user interface by combining Google Street View with telemetry data obtained from Ford's AppLink System.

We store our city lists(by zip code) and our phone numbers in Firebase. Each is saved by a dynamically timestamped automatically generated ID on behalf of firebase. This ID represents the User. When a user signs in to the home page, they are added to our firebase database if they are not already in it. They can then add more than one zip code of cities as input on the next page of the site. </p>\n<p><strong>Obstacles we encountered:</strong>\nWe spent a lot of time on authorization, supporting multiple users, and how to structure our database(by phone number, by email and password, by dynamically generated ids?) We found that email and password is simply overkill for this type of service but login would be appropriate so city lists can only be updated by that authorized user. We also struggled to focus on the simple minimum viable product even though we had really trimmed down our ambitions! </p>\n<p>Additionally, we had two api struggles: We had hoped that the API we were using to check for emergencies was just one endpoint that would return a object with a list of places or emergencies(called \"alerts\" by Wunderground). This way, we would be able to scrub that against our users' array of zip codes. Hence, a match is found, then that objects respective phone is messaged with our Twilio api. </p>\n<p><strong>What we learned:</strong>\nInstead, this endpoint (the Wunderground alerts API) could only be queried with a particular zip or city name in tow(included with request), so we had to iterate through our list and query, then look for a match and invoke the sendMessage function. This opened a new can of worms: How often would this process need to happen to ensure our users are getting frequent data? Would the same person be getting constant messages if they were a match? We needed to decide on a time interval and protect the user from being spammed. Also, luckily, Wunderground helped us unlimit our API calls so we could test to our delight!</p>\n<p><strong>Our successes:</strong>\nWe worked really well together, focusing on our strengths and helping each other along. We didn't have any problems agreeing on anything except where to sit. We each learned a lot. Although, it doesn't work as well as we'd planned as we put all the pieces together, each piece worked on its own. It was a truly educational and fun process, and a glimpse of real world use cases-- something that we have not yet experienced as we are new to programming.</p>\n<p>We learned a LOT about modularization, controllers, services, organization of files and concerns. This is a new concept for us students, (we are in week 4 of a bootcamp). After spending only about a day or two learning each Firebase and Angular, we were able to get a lot done. We also learned how to pack third party dependencies with our webpack even though they weren't necessarily webpack-loaders.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next for pocketWatch:</strong>\nWe each want to put this in our portfolio so it is not done. Samantha wants to implement MMS and other endpoints that return satellite data. Darien wants to test this with different structured firebase approaches. We plan to incorporate multiple users with multiple phone numbers, ease of login, and geo-location so your current location is always suggested as a city in your accounts city list. We also can't wait to implement more Twilio APIs that enable inbound messaging so people don't even have to log in or go online!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webpack</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/weather-underground\">weather-underground</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dlombardi/pocketwatch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dlombardi/pocketwatch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Angular UI routing, and made a function to scan all zip codes with the WUnderground API affiliated with a user for disasters.

But sometimes you just can't be bothered to have to go through the process of texting all of your friends just to make sure one is available to hang out. This is an issue we wanted to tackle with our app, i'm bored.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>i'm bored allows users to see whether or not they're friends are ready to hang out, or \"bored,\" all within the privacy of their own account. Each account contains a contact list of friends who are on the app, and that contact list is only displayed when the user labels themselves as \"bored.\" The contacts are displayed in a way that allows the user to differentiate between their \"bored\" and \"not bored\" friends so that they can consider their options of who to hang out with more easily. \"Bored\" contacts can then be notified by the user if they want to hang out.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our minimalist design was constructed using HTML5 and CSS. In order to allow users to use our app conveniently on many different types of devices, we took advantage of the JQuery Mobile Library in order to give our product a responsive design. The functionality of the app, from the buttons and switches to the notifications and user accounts, were initialized using JavaScript. All of the data used in i'm bored, including the usernames, passwords, names, and friend lists for all users, were stored in a Firebase database, which we accessed with JavaScript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As we wanted to make our product as simple and user friendly as possible, we spent a large chunk of time figuring out which features we were going to include in the app, so as not to distract the user from the main function of i'm bored. It was very difficult to cut ideas that could potentially have worked in our product, but would've defeated the purpose of making hanging out and connecting with friends a relatively effortless process.</p>\n<p>One of those features was in-app messaging, so that users could interact with the friends they wanted to hang out with and possibly set up a time and place to meet, rather than just notifying them that the user is bored and wants to hang out. We were planning on integrating the Twilio API, where each user would be able to swipe on a friend's name and open up another screen with the message feed between the two users. Unfortunately, integrating Node.js with HTML5 on a local drive proved to be more of a challenge than we expected, despite having the original Twilio JavaScript file work in Terminal.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Overall, we're proud of the design of our app. Many of the debates we had over the app itself were about how people could merely see i'm bored as a substitute for a group text, so we reached the decision that i'm bored had to be simple enough for a potato to use. We were able to design and program an app that seems to have a very bare and minimalist design, but actually has a lot going on beneath the surface.</p>\n<h2>What's next for i'm bored</h2>\n<p>As of now, i'm bored is a web-application, which works fine across all browsers and operating systems, especially when the Twilio API is involved in terms of messaging. However, we would like to take it to market as an iOS and/or Android application, possibly linking the in-app messaging to the respective devices' built-in messaging applications. Users that prove to use different browsers and/or operating systems could still make use of the Twilio API in order to communicate.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on managing the Firebase database information, and attempted to connect i'm bored to the Twilio API in order to enable in-app messaging.", "", "", "", ""]], ["Didn't Read", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Sometimes reviews are too complex and long to read and you can't have a complete opinion about it just with some stars.

As high schoolers, we use social media to communicator with out friends more often than not, and we began to see a common problem in our respective lives: they interactions in our lives have become increasingly boring. We wanted a new way of looking at how we talk to other people (and how other people respond), we wanted something more than just the text we see and send on our screens - so we created IBMessenger.</p>\n<h1>What it does</h1>\n<p>Our app can tell us the person's personality traits, their general sentiment towards and more. We also built in extra features such as healthy texting - if your general tone takes a sharp spike downwards or we pick up certain key words we can recognize if you're suffering from depression and get help.</p>\n<h1>How we built it</h1>\n<p>We used the Twillio API to message/communicate between the app and other people\u2019s phones. All of the Twillio management is done on the backend with nodejs. After a sufficient amount of text is used in the interaction, we sent the text to our Watson backend which ran IBM Watson\u2019s personality insights. We then use those personality insights to create a \u201cpersonality profile\u201d for everyone you message. Based on that info, we calculated a \u201ccompatibility\u201d score which represented to other persons interests in you, along with other various information to provide a greater insight into your daily conversations.</p>\n<h1>Challenges we ran into</h1>\n<p>Connecting the Twillio to both receive and send SMS without being too complex. We also had some trouble setting up the initial IBM Watson backend.</p>\n<h1>What we learned</h1>\n<p>We learned a lot about the Twilio API as well as setting up IBM Watson. </p>\n<h1>What's next for The Ultimate Messager</h1>\n<p>We are looking forward to launching our app in the app store.

It's true:  ADD/ADHD can make you procrastinate, think there is more time than there actually is, and frustrate those around you.  </p>\n<p>I could have blamed it on Dreamforce, the Giants vs. the Diamondbacks... but it was me.  </p>\n<p>This is the inspiration for my app. I want to build an app that would tell me when I have to leave, both as a soft reminder and a hard reminder,  and then tell me to get the hell up and GO!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is an IoT app that gets you to where you need to be on time by synching your email, calendar, mobile, wearable, and car/rideshare together.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I first explored the user experience from last week (e.g. being late).  I mapped out a journey map to identify my pain points and opportunity for improvement.  I graphed all actions necessary for an appointment on a timeline beginning before leaving for my destination.  I further identified weather my thoughts, actions, feelings were positive or negative.  Marking the downward sloping trends in the graph, the opportunities for improvement were clear: knowing when I needed to stop what I was doing, clearly defined when I wanted to arrive comfortably, allowing enough time to get to my destination, and adjusting for variables (e.g. weather, conferences, need for parking, etc.). </p>\n<p>I am a native San Franciscan.  So, I know the streets of San Francisco like the back of my hand.  What I do not know, however, are the variables that arise from construction, street closures, etc.  Moreover, my lack of knowledge completely prevents me from adjusting my travel time.  </p>\n<p>Thus, the app strives to make adjustments for me, give me \"ticklers\" to alert me to the actual time I need to be en route, and position me to get to my destination, on time and relaxed.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The number of API\u2019s I wanted to incorporate was unreasonable.  Every time I listened to one of the API talks, I ended up changing my mind about my project.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>As previously stated, I procrastinate, won\u2019t disengage when I get \u201cin the zone,\u201d struggle to accurately estimate time constraints.  Here, I really tried to watch my time,  my game plan, and keep my project and its development simple.  I think I did pretty well\u2026</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How talented everyone here is!  My fellow hackers have truly inspired me, and I am so proud to be among them!<br/>\nI have to give props to the Teenage Hackers and Pre-Teen Hackers who are here!\nAnd their parents to!  Thank you for taking the time and exposing them to a skill that will\nChange their lives for sure.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tickler</h2>\n<p>I hope that Tickler will inspire kids\u2026 and adults to give hacking a try.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">htm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag

We were inspired to create a tool that would help educators world wide communicate with students regardless of their location, culture or language.   </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The project uses inexpensive Raspberry Pi 2 computers, Windows 10 IoT Core, and live translation services running in Azure to transmit translated text to a remote device that can then project a 3D image for the students to view.  The 3D view is rendered dynamically using Unity, and the translated text is then converted to spoken word using the Cortana API. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the 3D projection using Unity and published the display to a Windows 10 IoT Core UWP app.  We then display that on a monitor that has a \"Pepper's Ghost\" inspired pyramid placed on top of it to create the feeling of a 3D image floating in space.  </p>\n<p>The text translation is done using the Text-to-Speech APIs built into Windows 10, then sends that data to a Project Oxford translation service running in Azure. The translated text is returned, and sent over the nextwork to the remote Raspberry Pi where the 3D display is rendered and the translated text is spoken using the Cortana API. </p>\n<p>We built it using Visual Studio Community Edition 2015, Unity Community Edition, and a lot of cutting and gluing of Acrylic.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Geometry.  Turns out cutting a 4 sided pyramid out of Acrylic is a lot harder than it seems.  In addition we ran into issues with the Raspberry Pi being temperamental about the USB port the headset was connected to.  </p>\n<p>Other challenges had to do with us all pushing ourselves to understand the tools and platforms we chose.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Geometry.  We finally got the pyramid made!  All in all it is a pretty impressive collection of technologies to pull together in a single hack.  Raspberry Pi, Windows 10 IoT Core, Universal Windows Platform, Azure Machine Learning, Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, Pepper's Ghost, Acrylic Fabrication, Unity Multi-Camera Views, and Slam Chopping code!  We are proud to have envisioned the project in the first place, and hope that you are as inspired by it as we were inspired by our teammate teaching in Africa! </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Geometry.  No seriously.  That was a lot harder than it should be for professional developers!  We learned a lot about the various APIs including Raspberry Pi, Windows 10 IoT Core, Universal Windows Platform, Azure Machine Learning, Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, Pepper's Ghost, Acrylic Fabrication, Unity Multi-Camera Views and Particle Systems. </p>\n<h2>What's next for HelloHolo</h2>\n<p>We would love to be able to render a full size person.  In addition, we'd like to extend it to include the ability to remotely sense and control the environments on both ends using a variety of sensors and actuators.  </p>\n<p>Most of all, we would love to be able to give it to somebody else as they travel the world to educate others.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-10\">windows-10</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-project-oxford\">microsoft-project-oxford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cortana\">cortana</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/dxmakers/disrupt15\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/dxmakers/disrupt15\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the acrylic pyramid and various Raspberry Pi and Windows 10 IoT Core debugging tasks.", "I worked on the backend machine translation service and the acrylic pyramid.", "I worked on the XAML UI with Paul and worked on the initial Unity integration", "", ""]], ["Grocer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Usually when I go to a supermarket, I spend a lot of time thinking about what I need to buy.

It's the joy of discovery that connects us with the world. Each of us has a different take, so why consume generic news feeds like \"business\" or \"foreign affairs\"? Our interests are dynamic (ever changing?) ! We want to know about what's going on right now, whether it's the Fed raising interest rates or the USA #feelingTheBern. </p>\n<p>Reading a news article is an effective way to learn about what happened, but what about contextually related issues? When Bernie Sanders talks about Universal Healthcare, you should be able to dig into Universal Healthcare. The market's current offerings lead you to a mind-numbing amount of articles parroting each other endlessly. Why aren't they guiding you deeper into the issues so that you can form your own point of view? <strong>Kn\u014d</strong> is an app that affords self-directed learning; enabling us to explore ideas to a personally significant level of understanding.</p>\n<p>Knowledge is power; get powered by <strong>Kn\u014d</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Experience</h2>\n<p>Search.

It allows you not to stand up from the couch to use frequently used commands like set \"do not disturb\" or set an alarm clock. All with voice control.</p>\n<h2>What is Amazon Echo?</h2>\n<p>Amazon Echo is a new category of device designed around your voice \u2013 it is hands-free and always on. Ask Echo for information, music, news, and weather from across the room and get answers instantly. Under Echo's light ring is an array of seven microphones. When Echo detects the wake word, it lights up and streams audio requests to the cloud, where it uses Amazon Web Services to recognize and respond. And because Echo\u2019s brain is in the cloud, it continually learns and adds functionality over time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You can activate it using \"Alexa, open app\" command, and she can do room services for you.\nE.g., \"Alexa, open app.\"\n\"Hello! Welcome to XYZ hotel.\"\n\"I'd like to get a cab.\"\nAlexa knows where you live. She sends an email with your room number and desired destination to the reception. </p>\n<p>Or, \n\"Set do not disturb mode on\"\nAnd she will change light indicator above your room door to red color.</p>\n<p>\"Room service\"\nAnd she will change light indicator above your room door to green color and send a text message to room service to clean your room.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mailchimp\">mailchimp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-lambda</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rstormsf/alexaclub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rstormsf/alexaclub\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Build-a-Buddy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build-a-Buddy \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/824/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build-a-Buddy \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/309/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build-a-Buddy \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/440/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We have learned that virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Samantha can be more than just assistants.

We enable conversation using the IBM Watson Dialog Service API.</p>\n<h3>Dialog Service</h3>\n<p>We transform each autobiographical text into a stream of vectors using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Latent Semantic Indexing</a>. This creates a list of topics that we use as classifiers.</p>\n<p>Using a <a href=\"http://www.nltk.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural-Language Toolkit</a>, we tokenize the body of text into sentences and label each sentence with the appropriate topics (classifiers). Using the topics as inputs and sentences as outputs, we can convert a  body of text into an xml file for the dialog service.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>It was difficult to find sufficient open-source text to train a wide range of personalities.
