Our vision was to merge the physical and virtual worlds in a visual medium through the power of the internet.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Data from the Myo armband is parsed, and state information is sent to the Arduino-connected LED strip via UDP over a WiFi network. A two-byte data packet is all that is sent, with the first byte representing a state command, and the second byte representing the ASCII representation of the luminosity of a particular channel (Red, Green, Blue).</p>\n<p>The controls are as follows:</p>\n<p>Relaxed Gesture (locked/unlocked):  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hand up/down with palm facing up will increase/decrease all color luminosity<br/></li>\n<li>Hand turn (think doorknob) will fade through colors.</li>\n<li>Hand above head - will flash colors!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SwipeIn/SwipeOut Gestures(unlocked):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will iterate through a list of colors<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fist Gesture while unlocked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will turn all lights off.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Calibrating the Myo armband for use was strenuous, but after some tweaking it works well in most situations. The Myo is also limited to five gestures, which prevented us from implementing as many features as we would like. There was a latency issue with the early TCP/HTTP implementation of the client-server protocol, and UDP was chosen as a better alternative for the application.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Not only can the device code be used for lighting the LED strip, but it can also be used for other hardware control projects. Since the Arduino simply accepts UDP packets and acts accordingly, there are limitless possibilities for creating and controlling an Internet of Things.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Real-time communication over WiFi generally is pretty slow. The Myo armband requires a heavy amount of calibration, and will hopefully have a lot of the bugs worked out in the near future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MyoLuminati</h2>\n<p>Using a second Myo armband, a greater degree of accuracy and a larger host of features can be achieved. The LED strip could also be embedded in clothing, which would be sure to create a marketable and frankly, awesome piece of partywear. Furthermore, the PC used to connect to Myo and send UDP packets could be replaced by an iPhone app for greatly increased portability. In another use case, the strips could simply be mounted on the wall as a piece of intuitively-controlled home-automation technology.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">udp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">9volt</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">socket</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">passion</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gokcekca/MyoLuminati\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gokcekca/MyoLuminati\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created both the client and the server code, which involves UDP packet communication.

After the user picks up the poke-ball they are teleported to a grassy field where they can throw their poke-ball and have their Pokemon come out. Little do they know, that Team Rocket's Meowth is lying in wait and appears to steal your precious Pokemon. You must fight him using the 2 moves your Pokemon knows. Choose which move to use by moving your Myo armband (waving in and out, and double tapping).

With standard chargers, charging your phone over night causes the battery to overcharge after it reaches 100%. This overcharge is not healthy at all for the battery and reduces its capacity and performance over time. Project Vitality solves this problem by providing a \"smart\" interface to the charger. This \"smart\" charger automatically stops sending current to the phone once it reaches 100%. This allows the phone's battery to remain much healthier, giving users longer use of their battery over a long period of time, and a longer charge over a short period of time. This saves the user a decent amount of money in the long term, as well as a better experience with their device as they get longer charge times during their normal use days.</p>\n<p>The project uses a Spark Core to connect to an Android application running on the phone. Once the phone reaches a full battery percentage, it tells the Spark Core to stop the current and stop charging the phone and alert the user it has done so. The Android application can also manually change the charging threshold and state of the charger from on or off.</p>\n<p>We hope to expand this product to iOS and other devices, especially by improving on our initial design. We also chose to nicely package our product into a nice prototype design as opposed to simply leaving everything as wires. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://charge4.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://charge4.me</a></p>\n<p>A334</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">relay</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://charge4.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://charge4.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>charge4.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Datlas", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Datlas \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/121/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Datlas \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/122/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Datlas \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/123/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The ease, speed, and convenience of being able to click on a word and have its definition is unmatched. We loved the idea of being able to move beyond simple English definitions of words, and open up the \"clictionary\" for developer documentation! To this end, we created a new tool: Datlas. </p>\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n<p>Our design strategy was simple and intuitive: To use the fewest amount of mouse-strokes and clicks as humanly possible. With a quick double-tap, this trigger summons a window to display Programming Language documentation at a glance. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>Once we harvested the documentation from our programming language of choice, we realized that the sheer numbers of the results would prove to be an arduous search task. We determined that by moving from an interpreted language to byte-code would give us the edge in speed required for those lightning results. Thus, we leveraged a database approach.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're Proud of</h2>\n<p>A steady, constant, and enlightening build process harmonized the relationships of the team and optimized productivity. We over came challenges through quick sessions of creative problem solving, followed by an action-based approach that made sticking with our plans a reality. </p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li> 4/4 all new to browser extension development</li>\n<li> 2/4 team members new to javascript</li>\n<li> 3/4 members new to couchDB</li>\n<li> Deeper development of HTML5 and CSS3</li>\n<li> Strategies to have a motivated, high-energy team that produces results</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's Next for Datlas</h2>\n<p>As we extend the scope of the project, we reuse design infrastructure like CouchDB to add more programming languages to Datlas.

Players indirectly control a ship by placing either positive or negative megnetic anomalies, which will either repel or attract their charged ship such that it reaches their goal.</p>\n<p>Derek Rooco and I sought to create a game that could be played on any system - computer, phone, or tablet, but that would also provide a full-featured user experience. We wished to create a game that, unlike most, could actually reach market and captivate audiences.</p>\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n<p>In Phazor, each level is broken into two stages. In the first stage, players may examine the level and place magnetic anomalies, each with either positive (red) or negative (blue) polarity. Then, the player launches his ship to begin the second round.</p>\n<p>In the second phase, players no longer place nodes. Instead, their ship travels through the level and is pulled or pushed by the nodes they placed earler, so that they do not crash into any obstacles. At any time, the player may swap the polarity of their ship, which inverts the effects of all nodes.</p>\n<p>Players win a level by reaching a goal with their ship. Players who successfully reach the end are given a score based on the number of magnetic anomalies they had to place in order to win. They may then proceed onto the next level.</p>\n<p>The game begins with a tutorial, which teaches players how to place magnetic nodes and how they affect the environment. As they progress through the game, they must cross progressively more difficult obstacles, including moving platforms and spinning wheels.</p>\n<h2>Technologies and Algorithms</h2>\n<p>Phazor is developed written in C# and developed in Unity 5, a popular videogame developent engine. Because Unity doesn't have support for magnetic attraction (or gravitational attraction in a non-uniform direction), we implemented our own engine for that purpose.</p>\n<h2>Custom Levels</h2>\n<p>In addition to its built-in levels, Phazor also provides full custom level support. Users can create their own levels of the same quality and with the same game elements as ours. We feel that this is an essential tool missing from many modern games, and we are happy to support it. </p>\n<p>Users specify their custom levels in XML, and can customize a very large number of attributes for each game element.

The idea is that filters are adapted to color and brightness and not to the image's \"meaning\". For Monet, there are exactly 76899 types of images. For every one of these images, it applies a predefined set of filters (contrast, saturation, blur, exposure etc). </p>\n<p>At each generation, there are 21 versions of Monet being generated, each with its predefined filters. \nThe fitness function is you, the human being, voting for the best pictures. Human beings are excellent at intuitively computing what is beautiful. \nMonet starts with completely random filters, but using the principles of natural selection, it should theoretically converge towards quality art.</p>\n<p>What happens at each generation?</p>\n<p>First, from the votes registered in the database, we select the best global adaptations \nWe make all the genes slightly converge towards these optimal values (computing weighed averages with an element of randomness).\nThis mimics natural selection.</p>\n<p>Finally, we keep evolution from reaching a plateau by introducing completely random mutations uniformly within the population.</p>\n<p>Since this application is written in JavaScript and not running on a supercomputer, generation increment takes about 30 minutes.

The tools meant to help them such as CodeAcademy end up boring them, doing more harm then good. This is due to their fixed interactions, set lesson plans, and lack of interactivity with the user. Users should learn what they want, when they want, just as you would during an actual coding project.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>With GitYouSome, we let the user decide their own path. They pick the content along the way, and get self-tailored content and coding challenges built at their level. By crawling thousands of sources (Git, StackOverflow, etc) and parsing out user-specific content that learns as you do, we provide a level of support not found elsewhere.</p>\n<p>We make sure a user will never encounter any functions or commands they haven't been taught. This will reinforce the topics already visited and not make the learner confused about a topic due to unrelated syntax complexity.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the hardest parts of the project has been working with one experienced coder and three others who are new to coding. Delegating tasks has been fun, and trying to help without just completing along the way is difficult. However, my team has put in great effort throughout the time here, especially considering that we arrived very late after an entire day of driving.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The entire project has been very challenging technically. I've had to parse code segments to find both valid and invalid code, parse code and modify code in-line to override built-in functions for proper page rendering, and aggregate thousand of scraped web pages to find the best code to teach a user.</p>\n<p>We had to come up with ways to challenge a user based on arbitrary code. This was particularly difficult to even imagine. We came up with some clever solutions using code content and knowledge of what is being shown.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about JavaScript parsing, setting up multiple servers, and doing data analysis and comparison. Getting the front-end to work and format properly was a particular hassle, especially formatting of code.</p>\n<p>The other teammates all worked with completely new technologies. This posed a great challenge, but gave great rewards. Everyone is super glad they came and made huge personal strides.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GitYouSome</h2>\n<p>The next step is to make GitYouSome into a full-fledged educational tool. We believe the potential is massive, letting users follow their desires in learning. The fact that the code base is not fixed also allows for lots of interesting opportunities and easy expansion.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">scrapey</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chartist</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">putty</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">filezilla</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">win-scp</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Re-myx", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/337/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/335/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/333/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/334/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/336/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/464/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/331/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/332/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/330/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Re-myx \u2013 screenshot 10\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/329/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to redefine how artists present their music to their fans, while enriching the concert-going experience. There are a lot of music festivals out there, and bringing this new platform would open a great deal of potential features to them.</p>\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n<p>Re-myx is a gesture-based DJ application to mix music and control audio visualization. Simply download the <a href=\"http://www.mixxx.org/download/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mixxx DJ software</a>, and install the <a href=\"https://github.com/mcopley08/dj-sparta/tree/master/myo_scripts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Re-myx Lua scripts</a>. Also, the <a href=\"https://github.com/mcopley08/dj-sparta/tree/master/mixxx_keyboard\" rel=\"nofollow\">custom keyboard</a> needs to be integrated in your Mixxx profile, and instruction on that can be found <a href=\"http://www.mixxx.org/manual/latest/chapters/advanced_topics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Once these steps are completed, you can start controlling your music via your <a href=\"https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Myo device</a>!</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>This project was exceptionally difficult because our team wasn't familiar with the Myo platform. We struggled with creating mappings between the Myo armband and the Mixxx playback software in the early stages of development. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We created three sets of scripts for Myo that control music through Mixxx in three very distinct ways:</p>\n<h3>Equalizer Mode</h3>\n<p>Allows user to finely control the high, mid, and bass level for a track</p>\n<h3>Distortion Mode</h3>\n<p>Gives user ability to adjust synchronization and special effects of a track</p>\n<h3>Advanced Mode</h3>\n<p>Allows user to control track, equalizer, and volume</p>\n<h2>Audio Visualization</h2>\n<p>We also had enough time to write a Lua script for <a href=\"http://www.vsxu.com/products/player\" rel=\"nofollow\">VSXu</a>, which is an audio visualization program that analyzes the sound your computer is creating, and adjusts its video output accordingly. Our initial idea was to control LED lights to enhance the experience, but we didn't have the compatible hardware to make that a possibility.</p>\n<h2>What We've Learned</h2>\n<p>This project gave us experience with how to use the Myo SDK to control various desktop applications, and also how to write code in Lua. We've also learned about what gestures/features would be meaningful to a live performance artist that would be using this kind of feature. </p>\n<h2>What's Next for Re-myx</h2>\n<p>Right now, Re-myx has three solid pre-sets that easily allow users to control their music. We want to expand on this idea to customize Re-myx for any performing artist that wants to integrate it into their set. This includes but is not limited to:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding more pre-sets</li>\n<li>Using the Myo armband to control lights, fog machines, sound samples</li>\n<li>Triggering other kinds of events, possibly through cell phone push notifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal we have is to connect with interested artists and create a memorable, lasting experience for the fans that attend their shows. </p>\n<p>Re-myx has the potential to change how we as a community interact with music. It may drastically transform the atmosphere of musical gatherings, the flow of concerts, and the way that music is produced. </p>\n<p>We hope to take Re-myx to the next level by developing more Myo scripts for extended functionality as well as integration among other wearable platforms such as pebble and Oculus rift. Re-myx can be an invaluable tool for current music students and performers. It can easily assist students to better study music. It can help reduce the cost of DJ equipment and help performers better interact with their audience. Though Re-myx was made to enhance how my friend and I enjoy our music, we see now, that the possibilities for it are endless.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mixxx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vsxu</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.myx-band.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.myx-band.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.myx-band.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mcopley08/myx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mcopley08/myx\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Whirlpool Real Time Sports Display on Dryers", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_R9xhq0VSU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Whirlpool Real Time Sports Display on Dryers \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/057/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Whirlpool Real Time Sports Display on Dryers \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/059/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>March Madness and MSU going to the elite eight and Whirlpool having a nifty api to give a main appliance a creative feature</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The user must provide the URL from espn through clicking on the box score.

To account for the increasing demand for smartwatch applications and the large population of users being college level and above, we have decided to create a Pebble Smartwatch application called Watering Hole. Watering Hole is an application that allows users to see open bars (or establishments that serve alcohol) near their current location. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>This app works by getting the current user locations through the smart phone and running the search queries we have created through the use of Google Places API.  The query shows bars that are within 20 miles (only the first seven results are shown), that have the keyword \u201cbar\u201d at the locations, and are currently open, noted by the \u2018open_now\u2019 field under the location.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into issues with familiarizing ourselves with Pebble.js and IP addressing.

Data from the packets is also available to viewed on the Android device, as well as several different settings and options.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had never really worked with Android apps before, which provided a considerable challenge to overcome in thirty-six hours.

Regardless of what you want to do to your stuff or your arch nemesis's stuff, BB can handle it.</p>\n<h2>Super Technical</h2>\n<p>The core of the BB is an Intel Edison. With just a servo connected, BB can limit who or what accesses the box. The primary way of using BB is the web interface, which uses your computer webcam to see what's going on. Images from the webcam are piped to the Edison, which runs an OpenCV algorithm to detect faces. Depending on what the box was set to, and whether it was armed or not, the box can deny entry to your potential Twix Thieves. Or Peanut-Butter Plunderers. Or you could trick them and not put anything into the box.</p>\n<p>The box also keeps a record of who attempted to access the box. A special panel allows you to see, in real time thanks to Socket.io, the faces of those perpetrators. Someone tried to steal your cookies? BB will catch them red-handed.</p>\n<h3>Regular Safe Mode</h3>\n<p>Just put in your items and watch your enemies tremble.</p>\n<h3>Self Restraint</h3>\n<p>BB can also be used to control your snacking. Now everyone knows how many snacks there were this weekend at SpartaHack. This is where BB comes in handy!</p>\n<p>You can place your items inside the box, and place BB into lockdown mode. If it sees anyone coming, it'll alarm the buzzer! So don't go anywhere near that box! Control thyselves!</p>\n<h3>\"Coop Mode\"</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, you just can't do self restraint. Well, having two people is always better than one!</p>\n<p>This box will keep shut, until you show up with one of your friends.

And by that, I mean this is our first one. \nOur hacking resume boasts a web app that emails you comic strips each morning and even three (wow!) Arduino starter-guide projects. Basically, we came relatively prepared with modest coding knowledge, not many ideas, and a large desire to learn everything we possibly could.<br/>\nWe've got quite a rap-sheet in the hardware lab's database\u2013we checked out a Myo, Leap, Pebble, and like a million other things. We eventually settled for the Intel Edison, because it seemed like a good combination of hardware (we liked our arduino) and software (we liked our web app). </p>\n<h2>The Plan</h2>\n<p>Our initial idea was to use the Edison to host a website, and then feed information like uptime stats and users online to a pebble app. We then realized that realtime web hosting info isn't really something anyone needs on their wrist; or, at least, not something <em>we</em> need. </p>\n<p>So, the new concept was set: Explore the potential of the Edison by creating a proof-of-concept home automation system controller, with the easy ability to see and change the status of, say, your garage door (if it's open) or your deadbolt smart-lock (if it's locked). Theoretically, this could be expanded to encompass ANY smart connected appliance. Though apps exist already for individual controls, we decided it would be great to place all the controls in one simple location; on an Edison web server. You log on, and then can control whatever factors you have access to with simple switches. You as the homeowner could theoretically give the babysitter a login to control the lock or baby-cam, revoking the access once she gets fed up with your low pay and eggs your house. \nIn addition, because the Edison has (buggy) USB Host capabilities, we installed BitTorrent Sync on the Edison, allowing one to connect to a plugged-in flash drive or external hard drive and upload or download files from any device, including a phone. And it's all from the same server! Essentially, we've created a home-base for your home. </p>\n<h2>Challenges (of which there were many)</h2>\n<p>After finally picking an idea to move forward with, we had to spend oodles of time learning how to work with the Edison, which is as powerful and useful as it is, at times, complicated and frustrating. We had just finally seemed to get into the swing of things when we (with the help of the awesome Intel guy, Wai Lun) realized the physical pins on our Edison were bad. He swapped it out for us, but it meant we had to start over from scratch. Then, at about 2:00am, when we were on <em>another</em> roll and really getting everything working, we encountered <strong>another</strong> bug in the hardware that left us with an unreliable system (basically it blinks a lot and crashes for no apparent reason). This was terribly frustrating to troubleshoot and work around.</p>\n<h2>We really like what we've got.</h2>\n<p>We can see a significant amount of potential for expansion, and would love to explore connecting smart-products through their APIs as well as developing more useful resources to include on the all-powerful ControlYourHo.me server.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned:</h2>\n<p>Actually a really surprising amount. We learned about the Myo, Oculus Rift, Leap Motion Controller, and Pebble, and that none of them are really for us at this stage. We got pretty darn deep into the Edison, and can confidently program on it in the future. We both knew the basis of object-oriented programing, but we used Python and Flask for this project, neither of which we had used before. We learned about tons of great options for our future projects, like FireBase and Mashery. We also learned the difference between an API and an SDK, which is probably a pretty good to know. Finally, we had a really fun time and enjoyed ourselves greatly, even while in a constant state of being tired and puzzled.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bittorrent\">bittorrent</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ControlYourHo.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ControlYourHo.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ControlYourHo.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://35.14.107.22:5000\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://35.14.107.22:5000\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>35.14.107.22</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://35.14.107.22:8888\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://35.14.107.22:8888\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>35.14.107.22</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Hackathon Hub", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hackathon Hub \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/096/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hackathon Hub \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/262/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by various social media sites such as Reddit, Twitter, and Yik Yak to develop a way for hackers to communicate with each other during the period of a Hackathon only.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Hackers use the website to discuss what is going on at the Hackathon as well as brain storm and collaborate amongst each other.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning new platforms.

We then pivoted to making our Toss idea into a web app.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Bootstrap for the front end, Firebase for the backend.</p>\n<p>When you first load Toss in your browser, you are assigned onto the Blue or Red team, and given the opportunity to do you first \"Toss\", which tosses a \"pebble\" into your team's pile, giving you (and your team) a point, and gives you five votes to spend on your team.</p>\n<p>In order to toss again you need to spend \"votes\" given to you by your team. Your future tosses have a cost equal to the amount of points you've earned for your team.</p>\n<p>The goal is to facilitate teamwork between players of the same team as they try to accomplish a faster \"toss and vote\" loop between their team mates, helping each other beat the other team.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was the team's first time using Firebase, and some of the concepts that Firebase uses are new to the team, such as the async, ordering data, and callback stuff. Even though we had a bunch of issues, and have some incompleteness, we all learned a lot about how Firebase works (it's awesome) and some advanced javascript stuff (which is also awesome).</p>\n<p>It was the person who did the front end's first time using Bootstrap.</p>\n<p>Also, Chrome doesn't like it when a local html file sets cookies. Firefox is cool with it. That was an hour wasted.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are really proud of how we dealt with problems as we approached them. We came to the hackathon with no ideas, but had an awesome brainstorming session and pivoted several times throughout the weekend as we learned more about how Firebase worked.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Toss</h2>\n<p>We want to add perks that players can spend their individually accumulated points on to give players more of an incentive to continue their play session over time and rack up points. A chat may also be cool.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TeamImpatientBanana/toss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TeamImpatientBanana/toss/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Stage Manager", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stage Manager \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/146/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stage Manager \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/147/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stage Manager \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/148/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>How many stage managers does it take to...done! If you've ever had experience with technical theater, you understand the expectation for multitasking. The show must go on! Our app, Stage Manager, helps manage stage managers. Streamlining some of the responsibilities stage managers have during a rehearsal, such as recording times, overseeing actor attendance and taking notes, we no longer have to lug around our laptops and binders. With a script and one hand, and Stage Manager in the other, you'll be ready to fully immerse yourself in whatever production you're a part of. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Using local storage, Stage Manager keeps it simple and encourages its user to as well. Thanks to the darker colors, Stage Manager can be used backstage, or in booths without creating distracting light pollution. The large buttons and basic design are ideal for people in a hectic environment, such as backstage, and for those who are lacking in a technical background. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This is our first Hackathon and our first time working with mobile development and design. There was definitely a learning curve, especially in a time crunch, to figure out the fine points of making a completed project for the first time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to correctly set up a database and make smooth navigation. As we said, neither of us had much experience with mobile development, so just making a product that runs, especially one Miranda claims she will use for future shows, is something we are really happy about!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Coding rapidly is more of a challenge than we expected. As always, debugging is the trickiest part.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Stage Manager</h2>\n<p>We'd like to make Stage Manager for iOS. Also, adding features to cover more responsibilities, such as changing text color and being able to send rehearsal reports as emails.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">samsung-galaxy-s5</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["SpartaNow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SpartaNow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/041/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SpartaNow \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/040/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SpartaNow \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/039/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SpartaNow \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/018/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SpartaNow \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/019/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SpartaNow \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/233/020/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to create an app that fellow Spartans could relate too. Every Spartan can relate to walking and riding buses.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Whats the fastest way to get to Shaw from Wells right now? Most people would probably say that walking along the Red Cedar might be the fastest route, but what if it wasn't?  What if there was a Eastbound 30 stoping at wells in 30 seconds? That would make taking the bus the fastest route, since the next stop for Eastbound 30 is the CATA Station.  </p>\n<p>We managed to port our idea to iOS and Android as well as the Web. Our apps are super simple to use. First select the destination of you favorite place here at MSU and click the next button.  Immediately, you will see whether or not walking or taking the bus is the fastest.  The apps also provide travel times and arrival times.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Jeff: I struggled for hours with auto layout, so the app could could look nice on all iPhones and iPads. Everything thing else I was able to work through.</p>\n<p>David: Learning the google maps APIs for android was hard to start, but pretty easy and fun once integrated with the app. Also designing a UI that was consistent across Android and iOS was new for me and it was challenging to keep another platform in mind when working on the android app.</p>\n<p>Whitney:  I have never worked with Google Maps JavaScript API and have had very little prior experience with Javascript. Throughout the course of this weekend, the learning curve posed the largest struggle for me.</p>\n<p>Richard: I struggled at first to use the Google Directions API, but it became easier to use as the hackathon went on. I also had some difficulties parsing the http request response to find the proper data that we were after. When working on the design of the webpage, I was constrained by the designs of both the Android and iOS version of the app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Jeff: I feel like I got a much better handle on auto layout. I taught myself how to the use the Google Maps iOS SDK and how to request information from a server to an iOS app.</p>\n<p>David: I learned how to use the Google Maps Android API, and worked to design a server-client web service that would work with different platforms.</p>\n<p>Whitney: I have learned how to implement an API (Google Map Javascript API) into a Web Application as well as how to utilize the abilities the API offers. I also learned how to successfully use JQuery and Ajax to submit forms.</p>\n<p>Richard: I learned how to use the Google Directions API on a web server to communicate directions/time for our project. I also learned how to design and interface the web-server with different platforms.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>if here then see \"## Accomplishments that I'm proud of\"</p>\n<h2>What's next for SpartaNow</h2>\n<p>We plan to add more features like searching for locations and favorite locations.  We plan on eventually porting to the App Store and Google Play Store.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-directions\">google-directions</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/core-location\">core-location</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Jbaumeff/RedwoodIOS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Jbaumeff/RedwoodIOS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Jbaumeff/RedwoodAndroid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Jbaumeff/RedwoodAndroid\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Jbaumeff/RedwoodWeb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Jbaumeff/RedwoodWeb\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~baumjeff/SpartaNow/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~baumjeff/SpartaNow/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>webdev.cse.msu.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Say Something", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MwqiL2NQ4P4?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our love for Venmo</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Just watch it</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Trying not to smile</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We did it without smiling</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The lyrics to this song</p>\n<h2>What's next for Say Something</h2>\n<p>Janum's Venmo internship</p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]]]
