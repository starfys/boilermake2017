While talking with some friends about their bad experiences with eyewear, we thought of some solutions to make eyewear fitting more accurate and individualized.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Eye to Eye takes a thermal image of someone's face (and some notes on their preferences). This information is used to process an ideal frame for them which is then searched from an existing collections of sunglasses from retailers (sunglasses hut, etc.). If a match is found, the app returns a price estimate to the customer and the option to ship the eyewear to their address. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Backend is made in Java, pipes are dropbox API, front end is HTML5 and CSS. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There wasn't enough Android FlirOnes, so we had to build our app with the input from the iOS FlirOne but the backend on java. This meant some complicated piping from the iPhone to the backend than back to the front-end. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>FlirOne thermal imaging is passed to the backend which breaks it down into 3 sections. We gather the most intense heat points (reds) and take an average to draw contours (specifically in the eyes and nose). These lines are then compared with a table to find recommended fit.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Eye to Eye</h2>\n<p>Eye to Eye can use the imaging and data to produce a very personalized eyewear model which customers can then customize (change color, shape, etc). 3D-printing could then print out their customized frames which the customer can walk out of the store with.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/shuaizhu2/Eye2Eye\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/shuaizhu2/Eye2Eye\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the back end image processing algorithms and wrote the code that captured the images and broke them down for use in processing.

It matches riders with drivers that are going in the same general direction, and gives drivers the option to choose how much of a detour they are willing to make per rider.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We each had a slightly different idea of how the app was going to function. On the back end side, figuring out the right schema was the first challenge. Along the way, we came across a lot of bugs and had to figure out how to implement the map(...) function, call back functions, and asynchronous functions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We had an idea and were able to bring it far.

We also improved our ability to work in a team and collaborate, to patiently listen to each other and consider different perspectives.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cera</h2>\n<p>We definitely want to make it so that after a rider requests a match, the driver is able to be notified. Afterward, we would update the driver's information accordingly. The backend logic for taking into account the driver's destination and the destinations of the riders she's already taking is already implemented.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"

With this power, we hope to make a positive impact in the world- and what better way than through education? After all... would you rather read a textbook, or EXPERIENCE learning in the most immersive way possible? With VR, there's a lot of incredible possibilities, and for this Hackathon, we knew from the start we wanted to make something educational.</p>\n<p>In fact, our team (Connor Smith, Anish Kannan, and Kristin Agcaoili) often pursues social good and meaningful Virtual Reality projects on a regular basis. We're all officers in the Virtual Reality Club at UC San Diego, and lead frequent workshops for members. We've also won several awards for past social good projects, in areas including health, education, and environmental awareness.</p>\n<p>Now, equipped for the first time with an HTC Vive, we hoped to create yet another educational experience that could help students learn in a way that truly appeals to younger audiences. After enough thought, we focused on the idea of a chemistry lab simulation. Imagine being able to virtually perform labs and experiments before actually doing them in real life! Not only does it offer great training, but it outlines the risks that are often associated with chemistry labs and can effectively prepare students and teachers alike for real-world chemical experiments.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Chemistry Lab VR is an educational experience that can virtually simulate lab procedures and important lab safety measures. The user is immediately immersed inside a Virtual Reality laboratory, and can begin walking around using the HTC Vive to interact with the environment. There are lab procedures and safety guides spread across the tables, and a great deal of lab equipment that can be picked up, placed, thrown, or actually used in real lab procedures. </p>\n<p>The first step is to actually put on your goggles, which can be grabbed and physically placed on the user's head for full immersion. After that, it's free reign over lab experiments. For example, it's completely possible for the user to grab a beaker, fill it with water from the sink, place a ring stand on the Bunsen burner, place the beaker on the ring stand, and boil water. An even cooler experiment involves burning steel wool to observe an increase in mass. Of course, it's also possible to burn the lab pages using the Bunsen burner, and although we don't recommend this... it's pretty fun.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In order to create Chemistry Lab VR, we primarily used the Unity Game Engine, which involves C# scripting. We also used Autodesk Maya to create a vast majority of models in the experience. Of course, and most importantly, the project was created for the HTC Vive and was built with the help of SteamVR. We brought our own desktop computer capable of running Virtual Reality systems, and our own HTC Vive for development.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was our first time actually making an HTC Vive game at a Hackathon. We'd worked with Virtual Reality and Oculus before, but trying to set up the Vive and develop with it was an entirely different experience. We already faced an obstacle just trying to set the equipment up in a packed hackathon space, and barely met the 2 meter x 2 meter minimum space requirement. </p>\n<p>Much of our time was actually spent demoing the HTC Vive to others. Since it's new technology, most people at the Hackathon wanted to try the device. We were flattered and extremely willing to show others what we're so passionate about, but inevitably, it did greatly cut in to our development time.</p>\n<p>The hardest part about this project was probably coming up with the idea in the first place. We like to create meaningful experiences, and go above and beyond the current standards in Virtual Reality. After already making an educational cell biology game (Cell VR) on Oculus Rift, we had some trouble choosing a direction. Thankfully, after walking around at midnight at UCSB, we were able to come up with the idea for Chemistry Lab VR.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were actually able to create a full HTC Vive experience in the span of 36 hours, and had the amazing chance to share this technology with others. It's always enjoyable to come to hackathons and be in an environment with other tech enthusiasts and innovators, and so it was even more surreal when we were able to spread our own passion and share our experiences with others. </p>\n<p>On the technical side, almost all of the 3D models in the game were created by our team. These include the tables, the room, the information sheets, the scale, the Bunsen burner, the ring stand, the sink, the flask, the beaker, and the goggles. It's very rewarding to actually create so much of our own content, especially with an original idea.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to develop using the HTC Vive for the first time, an experience that required a great amount of team collaboration (especially when it came to debugging using the actual hardware).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Chemistry Lab VR</h2>\n<p>As officers and dedicated members of the VR Club at UC San Diego, we often form teams based on our hackathon projects and allow club members to work on experiences we created. This is a create way to get a group of extremely motivated people working with real, cutting edge technology, and also a fantastic method of continuing our original work. Through UCSD VR Club, members can expand on projects, create new projects, and improve projects in ways we may never have thought of. We hope to see this project reach great heights, as it's something that can actually help people in a positive way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">htc-vive</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/autodesk\">autodesk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">steamvr</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/connor-a-smith/SBHacks.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/connor-a-smith/SBHacks.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/share/ZkXvZdUqZb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/share/ZkXvZdUqZb/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>build.cloud.unity3d.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote several C# scripts and created particle systems from scratch.

As users upload receipts, it uses computer vision technology to automatically read and save that data into their spending habits.

We were going to pull the data from the Android SDK (Windows SDK not available yet) and port it into the Unreal Engine. If the average of the stress levels was above 60%, it would trigger a binary switch which would allow the user to put a great force on a block from some distance away. It was essentially telekinesis in VR. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Since we ran out of time, at the moment it's just a cool OCULUS platformer. (Sorry to let ya down!) I designed the map to make it challenging and visually appealing at the same time. Boxes, narrow walkways, and fast-paced movement controls made things difficult for the player.</p>\n<p>Players can make a mini-explosion happen in front of them by pushing T, which will set boxes near them flying. Using this mechanic, something even as simple as boxes can be made into a fun-to-beat enemy. I also observed that stacks of small blocks were a lot of fun to blow away - it felt a little epic for the player. So I made sure to include some of those juicy moments in the level :~)</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>OCULUS, Unreal Engine 4, Muse SDK, C++</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Muse SDK - Since the SDK was limited to Android, it was difficult for us to get the data across.
