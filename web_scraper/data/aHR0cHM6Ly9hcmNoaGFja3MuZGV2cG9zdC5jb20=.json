[["Brush Brush Revolution", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Dentists usually recommend using the fancy, $100 toothbrushes that have motors, Bluetooth, and an app store. For most people, these are out of reach, either because of fiscal insecurity or because there are cooler things to buy with a $100. We wanted to investigate how we could provide help with brushing while staying strictly within the confines of the cheap $1 disposable toothbrush and an everyday item: a smartphone.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>BrushBrushRevolution uses the webcam of the person's device to \"lock on\" to the color of a person's toothbrush. From there, it tracks the x-position, y-position, and velocity of the brush. We use some fancy, behind the scenes, math to derive the z-position, acceleration, quadrant of the mouth and other helpful data. </p>\n<p>We developed two example places to pipe this data - but this data could easily be opened via an API to let users put it in Apple HealthKit or let developers create other apps.</p>\n<h3>Brush Hero</h3>\n<p>As a child, we all brushed less than the recommended 2 minutes just because brushing is boring. We hoped to make it exciting by having children brush in rhythm. We only demoed quarter notes but that could easily be replaced with a <em>Let It Go</em> or whatever the child wants.</p>\n<p>Brush Hero also includes a monster fighting component. We developed an algorithm that rates brushing on a 1-10 scale in three categories (taken directly from the scientific literature): did they brush 2 minutes, was the brush at a 45 degree angle and did they spend roughly 30 seconds in every quadrant of the mouth. The higher the score is, the smaller the monster gives. Since the algorithm contains a time component, the real goal is to manage your quality/sec. That forces kids to get that 45 degree angle <strong>and</strong> brush for the full 2 minutes.</p>\n<h3>Analytics Software</h3>\n<p>While Brush Hero is fun, we also provide a more buttoned up analytics software. It rates your brushing and provides indications where you brush the most.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed the tracking software with a lovely library called <code>tracking.js</code>. The process behind developing tracking started with a basic \"can it recognize a specific color\" but quickly multiplied in complexity. Colors are not consistent to a camera (even if it was looking for a unicolor object, which was basically not the case) over time so we developed more and more complex calibration algorithms that would look for the correct color.</p>\n<p>Once we told <code>tracking.js</code> what to look for (usually a neon band we wrapped around the brush), it would show us with a little rectangle on screen what it was \"looking\" for. We exported that data for use in both </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We constantly faced calibration issues. We chose to use <code>tracking.js</code>'s color detection features because it involves less matrix math on our end than detecting the edges. The problem is colors change over the day (especially with all the natural light in here) and, more disconcertingly, they change with hardware. We did our best to make our app compatible witn as much as we could from a Nexus 6P to an iPhone 7 to an old 2 megapixel webcam. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Brush Brush Revolution</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tracking.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/plotly\">plotly</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stapes.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/brushbrushrev\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bit.ly/brushbrushrev\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bit.ly</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on gameifying for little kids and developing confidence intervals for the calibration of the color recognition.

Many blind students face great difficulty in mathematics due to their lack of visual understanding of functions and have little more to help them understand these equations than reading values aloud.</p>\n<p>We take eyesight for granted everyday and rarely stop to appreciate what a gift it is.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>I envisioned InteGraph as a teacher's resource to help blind students \"sense\" math. Instructors would simply visit our webpage, enter the function being taught to students, and download a 3D printable model that students could run their fingers along to feel the change of the function of the physical graph in order to gain a better understanding of math's nature.</p>\n<p>InteGraph works by accepting a math function from the user's text field, which is then sent to Wolfram Alpha's API to retrieve a processed GIF image of the two-dimensional graph. Each pixel of the image is then analyzed for deviation from the average overall color; using the deviation values, InteGraph compiles a mesh 3D model (STL file - fully ready for your 3D printer software), where each point's depth is determined by it's deviation from the overall average, resulting in a 3D graph that students can track with their fingers.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Similar to many web development projects, we created a git repository and devised a 'divide and conquer' approach. Two members worked on the front end while the other two worked on the backend.</p>\n<p>We wrote the backend in Python due to its extensive mathematical libraries which helped us write our algorithms in an efficient manner.</p>\n<p>The frontend was designed with bootstrap and programmed with JS to allow effective communication between our python scripts and the client.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>While trying to use Heroku-Django, we ran into a problem with nginx requiring another library to handle static files, so, to be most efficient, we switched to Flask in order to keep the number of dependencies and platforms to a minimum.</p>\n<p>While using Wolfram Alpha's API, I was getting invalid URLs and the error messages weren't helping.

What's even worse is that elderly and those near the poverty level either aren't getting their mental health checked up enough, if at all. This is evident because mental disorders are most common in both of these groups: the elderly and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Even when they do visit a mental health professional, the presentation of themselves to the mental health professional may only represent how they're feeling in that day. This problem of horridly low frequency of mental health tracking amongst these groups is what we sought to fix with our app FeelShot. FeelShot is a free mobile application that lets anyone track their daily mood and feelings so they can have peace of mind and also have a record of such informtion to show their mental health professional.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>FeelShot allows the user to take a picture of their face (selfie) in which an image analysis outputs how they are feeling today.

The best way current medical professionals and researches have to track prescription adherence is by tracking how often patients fill their medications at a pharmacy. This is a working method, but it doesn't provide granular data about the patients habits and true behavior. It also doesn't give the patient a reliable way to track their own medication adherence.</p>\n<p>We want to help patients stay on track with their medications with an easy-to-use, inexpensive, smart solution. The goal is to make the product fit naturally into the user's current routine. To do this, we use OCR to read the user's prescription information and require minimal setup with the physical hardware. Patients can use their existing pill bottles, and exchanging bottles is easy.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our hardware keeps track of when the user has taken their medication, and automatically syncs with an iOS app. We can use this data to provide the patient with reminders, a history of their medication adherence, and list of their current medications and schedule. The data can also be shared with physicians and researchers to study the benefits of medications.</p>\n<p>To set up the medication tracker, users simply need to scan their current perception bottle. The app reads the information, including the name of the medication, the dosage, and the frequency of dosage. This information is used to send the user reminders, track adherence, and visually display this data to the user.</p>\n<p>The user can view their adherence data in multiple different ways. The app includes a today widget, which displays the previously taken dosage and the next dosage. This information is quickly accessible on the lock screen of the phone so users don't have to open the entire app to check if they've taken their daily medication. The main app presents three separate views, the today view, the week view, and a monthly view. This allows the user to easily compare their adherence over a period of time, and motivate them to achieve perfect performance.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app is built with Swift and Xcode, and communicates with a Raspberry Pi that tracks the pill bottle through a Go server. The pill bottle's position is tracked using a magnetic sensor, which determines if the bottle is lifted out of its container. This information is sent to the server and analyzed by the iOS app. All sensitive medical information is saved locally on the user's app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The largest challenges were hardware-related. Finding an easy, safe, consistent way to measure when the user takes their medications proved difficult. We're happy with our magnetic sensor solution, and know that it can be improved in the future with a more powerful magnet.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're happy to have built a working product! We created a working prototype that solves our original goal, and can be useful in the real world.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about medications and current research into the effects of medication adherence. We also learned how to design for people other than ourselves, having to think about the needs and priorities of various parties, and come up with a solution that would be beneficial for a wide audience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MedTracker</h2>\n<p>User testing!

She gave my mom a little dictionary and told her that if she had any doubts about an ingredient, she should look it up and double check to make sure it was okay. Instantly, grocery shopping became a very tedious process of carefully reading lists upon lists upon lists of ingredients. And when I went to a friends' house, it was not uncommon for my mom to send me with gluten-free pasta in order to avoid the panicked phone call that inevitably came when their parents realized they had to figure out whether they had something gluten-free lying around. So, this weekend we set out to find a solution for people who are in the process of transitioning to a gluten-free lifestyle, as well as an easy way for people unfamiliar with the disease to be able to easily find a safe dinner solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app allows the user to take a picture of the list of ingredients on the packaging of any food item they wish. Then, it sends this image out to an OCR API to detect and extract the text in the image. This raw data gets sent to our custom Classification API, where first we use express.js to receive the data and communicate it with node.js. Then, we send the data out to an autocorrect API to catch any errors that the OCR might've made. At this point the app pulls data regarding the 'safety' of different ingredients from a Redis database. Finally, it parses the ingredients data, determining which one are 'safe', which are 'unsafe', and which are 'risky', before sending all this data back to the app to be displayed to the user.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the back end using Node.js, express.js and Redis; the front end was built using Swift and Xcode. We also used the Google Cloud Vision API for its OCR capabilities, as well as using Microsoft Cognitive Services Bing Spellcheck API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>On the back end, the biggest issue we ran into was trying to implement the use of a spellcheck API because the way our code was structured involved trying to deal with return values from Promises; we had to restructure our whole code in order to get around this issue.\nIn terms of design, the biggest challenge was figuring out what was useful and what was not, as well as the best way to represent the data gathered and how to communicate it with the audience.\nFinally, on the mobile end the biggest challenge was trying to figure out how to integrate API's into the project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This project was everyone's first time building and deploying a mobile app, so we were all super stoked that we were able to bring our vision to life as effectively as we did. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Having a well-balanced team is an incredible asset when working on such a comprehensive project.

We wanted to develop a solution to help people of all ages and background become more compliant in taking their medicine regularly while making it as easy as possible to do so.</p>\n<p>Compliance and medication scheduling is especially an issue in our aging population. We envision something like <em>The Med Manager</em> being very useful in nursing homes and assisted living communities.

To do this, you just tell Alexa you took your medication and it gets tracked. You can the request a compliance report from Alexa and she will tell you which medication you have missed in the past and when you missed them.</p>\n<h2>Barriers</h2>\n<p>The biggest barrier was that two of us had no experience with development on the Amazon Echo. This was also our first time working with DynamoDB, which was a great learning experience.</p>\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<p>The biggest takeaway for us is the realization that the future of smart home assistants is very bright. Voice controlled assistants will be very helpful for many segments of our population, especially the elderly.  </p>\n<h2>To the future</h2>\n<p>We would like to develop an app to be used in conjunction with <em>The Med Manager</em> that is capable of letting users visualize their data and share that with their primary care providers.

attention to their sleeping habits. To achieve this goal, we model a \"sleeping habit competition\" based on personal social network. Users can choose whether to publish their sleeping record to social network and also gain the access to their friends' data.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users link their accounts through Facebook so that their friends' data will be available as well. The app can rank the sleeping time, and display the top three \"winner\" in the sleeping competition and their own ranking.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use Facebook Api to connect people, HealthKit to collect sleeping data, SQLite to manage small pieces of data on iPhone, mLab (MongoDB) to maintain big data, Heroku to operate the whole system, NodeJS as server-side framework and language to apply high quality data structure calculation, and, the most important thing, Swift+HTML+CSS+jQuery to </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Successfully find the Facebook friends and get access to their data.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for SleepRank</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SleepRank\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SleepRank\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["reQuest", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"reQuest \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/470/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>restrictions keep people from viewing what the world has to offer\ncomplications as varied as physical and mental health can keep an individual indoors or bedridden</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We provide a service valuable to those experience these hardships.  reQuest connects viewers and explorers.

What the code for the create method does is find a user with the username, uses a helper method built into the User model through bcrypt's has_secure_password (which we'll get to later), then if the user exists and is successfully authenticated, the user will have a session, and the app will redirect to its root path, which we'll also get to later.</p>\n<p>After that, create a users controller.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ rails g controller users new create destroy\n</code></pre>\n<p>In your new users controller (located at /app/controllers/users_controller.rb), edit it to look like the following.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>class UsersController &lt; ApplicationController\n    def index\n        @users = User.all\n    end\n\n    def new\n    end\n\n    def create\n        user = User.new(user_params)\n        if user.save\n            session[:user_id] = user.id\n            redirect_to root_path\n        else\n            redirect_to signup_path\n        end\n    end\n\n    private\n    def user_params\n        params.require(:user).permit(\n            :username,\n            :first_name,\n            :last_name,\n            :email,\n            :dob,\n            :password,\n            :password_confirmation\n            )\n    end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>The index method indicates necessary code for when the /app/views/users/index.html.erb page is shown.  After that page is implemented, when the user navigates to localhost:3000/users, the user will be able to see a list of users, because they have access to a variable that displays all users.  For the new method, that essentially just takes from create for the purpose of this controller.  For the create method, a new user is created from the given permitted parameters in the user_params method.  If the user is saved, the user will automatically be logged in and redirected to the root path.  Otherwise they'll just be redirected to signup.  Finally, the user_params method is just a method that allows for only certain fields to be passed in through a form so hackers don't try to inject SQL or something.</p>\n<p>Next, navigate to /app/models/user.rb and add the following line inside the User class</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>has_secure_password\n</code></pre>\n<p>This comes from the bcrypt gem we added to our gemfile. This stores a password digest, an encrypted version of the password, in the database, so even if a hacker gets access to your database, they'd still have to decrypt the passwords to make any sense of it. This also adds the authenticate helper method to verify a user with a password.</p>\n<p>Now we want to make a view such that users can actually sign up for this app.\nNavigate to /app/views/users/new.html.erb and edit it to look like the following</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>&lt;%= form_for :user, url: '/users' do |f| %&gt;\n    First Name: &lt;%= f.text_field :first_name %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    Last Name: &lt;%= f.text_field :last_name %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    Username &lt;%= f.text_field :username %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    Email: &lt;%= f.text_field :email %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    Date of Birth: &lt;%= f.date_select :dob, :start_year =&gt; Date.today.year - 100, :end_year =&gt; Date.today.year %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    Password: &lt;%= f.password_field :password %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    Password Confirmation: &lt;%= f.password_field :password_confirmation %&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n    &lt;%= f.submit \"Sign Up\" %&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This creates a form, allows for users to add in each of the required fields to create a user, and submits it.  Upon submission, it will call the create method from the users controller and go through that code to create the user.</p>\n<p>Now that a user can sign up, we want a way for them to log in as well.  So we're gonna navigate to /app/views/sessions/new.html.erb and create a login view.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>&lt;h1&gt;Login&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;%= form_tag '/login' do %&gt;\n\n  Email: &lt;%= text_field_tag :email %&gt;\n  Password: &lt;%= password_field_tag :password %&gt;\n  &lt;%= submit_tag \"Submit\" %&gt;\n\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>This routes the submission to the login path, which will be defined in config/routes.rb as sessions#create, which will call the create method in the sessions controller and create a user session.</p>\n<p>Now, just so that users have somewhere to navigate to and so that we have an adequate root page, \nFinally, you need to add your new routes such that everything will point to the right thing.  Navigate to /config/routes.rb and edit it to look like the following.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>Rails.application.routes.draw do\n    get '/dashboard' =&gt; 'pages#dashboard'\n    get '/tutorial' =&gt; 'pages#tutorial'\n\n    root 'pages#dashboard'\n\n    get '/login' =&gt; 'sessions#new'\n    post '/login' =&gt; 'sessions#create'\n    get '/logout' =&gt; 'sessions#destroy'\n\n    get '/signup' =&gt; 'users#new'\n    post '/users' =&gt; 'users#create'\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>This essentially says \"when the user navigates to /dashboard, it will link to the Rails route described by the command 'rake routes' as 'pages#dashboard'.  It essentially renames the routes to those pages to something more user-friendly.\" Speaking of user-friendly, open up /app/views/layouts/application.html.erb and add the following in the  tags.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>&lt;% if current_user %&gt;\n    Signed in as &lt;%= current_user.username %&gt; | &lt;%= link_to \"Logout\", logout_path %&gt;\n&lt;% else %&gt;\n    &lt;%= link_to 'Login', login_path %&gt; | &lt;%= link_to 'Signup', signup_path %&gt;\n&lt;% end %&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Therefore, on every page, you will be able to login and logout. Stuff in application.html.erb will be visible and accessible everywhere in the web app. Now we need to one last thing. Go back to your terminal and type the following.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ rails g controller pages dashboard tutorial\n</code></pre>\n<p>And now you have all the pages you need!  Just run 'rails s' and you'll have your user model and authentication working!</p>\n<h3>Adding a user avatar</h3>\n<p>This is an image sharing website, right? Wouldn't it only be right for a user to have a profile picture?  Let's make that now.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ rails g migration AddAvatarToUsers\n</code></pre>\n<p>For this one, we're gonna manually write the migration for this. Navigate to /db/migrate/_add_avatar_to_users.rb, and then edit it to look like the following.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>class AddAvatarToUsers &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]\n  def self.up\n    change_table :users do |t|\n      t.attachment :avatar\n    end\n  end\n\n  def self.down\n    drop_attached_file :users, :avatar\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p>Self.up tells Rails what to do when the attachment is created.  It adds a field of type attachment called avatar to the users table.  Conversly, self.down tells Rails what to do when the attachment is destroyed, it just drops the field from the table.  Now that you've changed the database schema, you need to migrate your database.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ rake db:migrate\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we need to update the model to accept and validate an attachment, as the Paperclip gem requires.  Navigate back to /app/models/user.rb, and beneath 'has_secure_password', add the following lines.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-ruby\"><code>has_attached_file :avatar, :styles =&gt; { :medium =&gt; \"300x300&gt;\", :thumb =&gt; \"100x100#\" }, :default_url =&gt; \"/images/404.jpg\"\nvalidates_attachment_content_type :avatar, :content_type =&gt; [\"image/jpg\", \"image/jpeg\", \"image/png\", \"image/gif\"]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now that the model has been updated, we need to update the controller and the view to allow for a user to upload an avatar.  So remember the users_controller.rb file we edited earlier?

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We observed that large hospitals and other organizations often have translation resources available for situations in which patients and doctors cannot easily communicate. However, smaller organizations do not have those resources on hand, yet still might occasionally face language barriers. We wanted to create a tool that would allow doctors and patients to communicate critical symptomatic information in situations where the two parties speak different languages and even in cases where the patient cannot read or write.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The patient selects a body type that most accurately reflects their size and gender identity. Then, the patient selects body parts with which they associate the symptoms they have. Upon selecting a body part, a more detailed view of that part will be displayed where the patient can select a more specific area where the symptom is occuring. After selecting that area, the patient can choose from a list of visual icons representing common symptoms that might be assocated with that area of the body. After selecting a symptom, the patient will then be able to convey details such as pain intensity, duration, and frequency through visually-oriented sliders and diagrams. At this point, the patient can then go back to the body screen, select another part for a new symptom, and continue the process. A doctor standing by can take note of the information the patient is conveying and interpret it to produce a diagnosis and eventually a solution.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Android Studio to design an application for Android devices which would perform the tasks described above. We made resources by researching common visual guides used by medical professionals to help diagnose patients, such as the Wong-Baker pain scale. We modeled our images off of these designs and also made our own illustrations to best suit our purposes.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We encountered a lot of difficulty when trying to find usable data about patient symptoms and how they are used for diagnoses. Lots of data was not available publicly and we could only find general overviews about it that were not very useful to us. We also don't have a lot of experience with designing applications or working with Android Studio, so we encountered many hurdles while trying to design our project and implement our ideas.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the very broad perspective we took when considering what sort of information doctors and patients would need to communicate and the diverse sets of ways in which they might choose to convey it. We were very aware of the fact that people from different places around the world don't necessarily associate the same visual cues with certain symptoms as we do, so we tried to design our visual aids so they could be used universally instead of just choosing images that we and our friends could understand. We are also very proud of the fact that all of us come from different disciplines, such as computer science, public health, social work, mathematics, and environmental sustainability. We each contributed very different ideas to our project and brought them together to create something unique. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about troubleshooting, Android Studio, and using GitHub. We also learned a lot about creating images and health communication.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Connect Health</h2>\n<p>We would like to get the app to a workable state, add many more symptoms, and also cover situations including mental health and preexisting conditions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">paint</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/powerpoint\">powerpoint</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/johnisboring/Concept\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/johnisboring/Concept\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped develop the general idea and concepts, and also worked on setting up the application code.", "I helped conducting research around physical and mental symptoms.

We therefore developed PyLens, a portable low-cost microscopy system capable of screening for eye disease, profiling the ocular surface, and measuring differential changes in oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the eye. </p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>The PyLens is constructed with a Raspberry Pi, four individually addressable LEDs, low-lost optics, and 3D printed optomechanical components. It also only costs around $130 and requires no smart phone to operate. By acquiring images with different angles of illumination, the PyLens is capable of acquiring 3D reconstructions of the ocular surface. In addition, the PyLens can also perform spectral imaging of the eye. Due to the wavelength dependent absorption of light by hemoglobin, the PyLens can measure relative changes in oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin.  Both these features in combination with machine learning algorithms available developed with our system, give the PyLens a unique capability in diagnosing eye impairment, specifically in low resource settings. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Medical Advice Twitter Bot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Medical Advice Twitter Bot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/672/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Reply with links from search results</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Medical Advice Twitter Bot \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/673/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Reply with stored response</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted a web-based project and had just recently learned about Twitter and Node.js in class.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It searches through recent tweets for medical keywords, and either replies with specific advice if available, or links to outside information.

With weekly data ranging from 1990 to 2016, we have mapped the percentage of all deaths that are flu deaths as well as unemployment rate at that time and location. Looking to the future, we have created a K-Nearest Neighbors model to predict influenza deaths using factors such as location, year, week, and most importantly, unemployment rate.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using data sets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and The Department of Labor, we built a visualization using javascript leaflets with state color varying by flu severity and individual city flu mortality and unemployment rates. The K-Nearest neighbors model was created using SciKit-Learn to predict future flu data based on the prior datasets. Built on a local host, this web visualization is also enabled for iPad, iPhone 6+, iPhone 6, and a variety of other mobile devices.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>From computer problems to training a model, the process of creating a working visualization proved to have many challenges. Leverages rest APIs for Javascript libraries and correctly importing the data to the end product. Working with such large datasets, it was difficult to ensure the proper format and clean data. Implementing CSS libraries also proved to be a challenge, as well as training a model and creating predictions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of every element of our final product. The visualization of the flu data on the U.S. map with the specific coloring related to severity, the specific city data, the week slider, and overall design of the visualization are all elements that we are proud of. An accomplishment we are particularly proud of is the K-Nearest Neighbor model and it's predictions.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Throughout this process, we have learned how to train a K-Nearest Neighbor model and make predictions based on that data. We have also learned many new elements of web design and how to deal with all of the challenges we have encountered over the past two days. This experience has also helped us develop many new collaborative and problem solving skills, as well as how to develop under pressure and with limited time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Where in the World is Flu-men Sandiego?</h2>\n<p>An improved prediction model with more socioeconomic data would be a wonderful improvement to Where in the World is Flu-men Sandiego. With more time, we could extend the model beyond just the flu to include the spread of other diseases.

It is hard for everyone to understand another person when language is a barrier. More so, when it comes to professionalism, especially in the healthcare industry, patients have to completely understand what doctors are telling them. And sometimes it is just tough for a person to learn numerous languages to convey their message to people. While doctors may utilize English as a means to communicate, not everyone has a powerful command of English or sometimes nowhere near proficient to effectively communicate with a doctor to convey symptoms or to easily understand the doctor's diagnosis</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Cadence is a 3 part program. \n------FIRST------\nWe have a speech translation service to translate from almost any language to English, this is mostly used by patients to keep the doctor informed of any information. \n------SECOND------\nThe information is then evaluated by a doctor. The doctor then replies with an input or any pertaining information, which is automatically translated back into a language that the patient is comfortable with.\nThe overall information that is kept by the app, easy-to-understand visuals are constructed to convey the diagnosis of the doctor and to keep track of the patient's overall health. \n------THIRD------\nShould the patient have any more concerns, there is a \"doctor bot\" which the patient or doctor can ask questions to be provided concise answers quickly about symptoms.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The linguistic translation process works by having speech be transcribed into text with Tropo, an API by Cisco. Then that transcription is translated from the selected language into English through the Google Translate API. Finally, the translated text is played back to the user through the use of the Text-To-Speech service, also by Tropo.\nThe Bot was created on Cisco Spark using their chat-room service, which is able to host a bot.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A major challenge was to link all the APIs together, especially for the translation aspect of the app. The process to invoke Tropo then Google and finally back to Tropo was easier said than done. It was indeed a struggle to link them together. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The team collaborated together and managed to come a long way to develop such an application involving multiple technologies, despite not having all of the expertise needed. Many hours were put into making Cadence happen, and the outcome of it is astounding.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about the process of making an application from scratch. Everything from design, programming to touch-ups and execution was an intense process. The team also had to quickly pick some new languages up, which is a long-run accomplishment.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cadence</h2>\n<p>Cadence may seem to be an intuitive and simple application, it has the potential to become something much more useful and powerful. It would be of sheer happiness and pleasure if a company were to adopt Cadence and continue to develop the app to allow patients and doctors to communicate more effectively.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tropo\">tropo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cisco\">cisco</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-translate\">google-translate</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://cadencecares.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cadencecares.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cadencecares.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Gesture Based Caregiving", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNP6vq-AiZQ?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gesture Based Caregiving \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/453/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Caregiver Interface</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gesture Based Caregiving \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/600/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Gesture Requests</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gesture Based Caregiving \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/641/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>In action</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Currently, patients in hospitals notify staff of their caregiving needs by making a call using a phone, or by pressing a button that requests the presence of a nurse. We wanted to improve on two aspects of this system. First, injured or elderly patients may not be physically able to reach a phone or a button. Second, valuable hospital time is wasted when the nurse must visit the patient for every request, find out what the request is, and then leave. Our system allows patients to send requests with a minimum of physical movement, and for caregivers to know what their request is instantly through the visual request dashboard.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Once a Leap Motion controller with Gesture Based Caregiving is mounted by a hospital bed, bedridden or physically less-able patients can simply make gestures in the air to navigate a caregiving request menu. The request is made and prioritized based on severity (request for water, low priority - request for painkillers, high priority), and is fed to a web-based visual dashboard to allow the caretaker to manage requests from multiple patients.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The gesture-recognition is done using a Leap Motion controller and the Leap Motion Javascript library. The visual dashboard is built in Javascript using D3.js. For high priority requests (such as health emergencies), a notification is sent to caregivers over text using the Twilio API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>While our original plan was to store requests using JSON files and read then using D3.js, it proved to be difficult to get working.

The created various questions about determining which drug was the best over-the-counter medicine based upon the symptoms to how much a drug is safe to take based upon person biostatistics. Unlike prescription medicines, over-the-counter requires no prescription and no consultation about usage and dosage from a medical professional. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SiMed was created with the intention of designing a simplistic and easy to use application to aid in discerning knowledge about over-the-counter medications. Thus, the app\u2019s main three functions are </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Giving a dosage amount personalized to biostatistics</li>\n<li>A recommendation based upon current symptoms </li>\n<li>A notification system to aid people in remembering when they last took a dose and when it is safe to take the next one if necessary.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The dosage function uses conversion units recommended by various hospitals and pharmaceutical companies data and research to determine the personalized amount. And the recommendation function uses user input of current symptoms and algorithms rating each system to come to a conclusion of the best over-the-counter medication for their current state.  And finally, because a common issue is forgetting when medication was taken, over-the-counter drugs actually have a level of danger due to over usage of the medication. A notification system allows for a safe way to take medications in a timely manner by reminding and storing when a person has last taken the medication. \nThe mobile application runs on both iOS and Android operating systems to allow for a larger consumer base. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app was built using the Ionic Framework with Cordova.

We believe that one of life\u2019s most rewarding and necessary experiences is the relationship between seniors and the young. With many seniors living alone in facilities with limited contact with their family CTG can remedy this issue by providing a social platform where hospitals and nursing homes can:\nSignup their facility to be a part of the CTG network\nThe facility will now appear on the CTG map\nStudents will select facilities, appearing on the facilities\u2019 account\nNurses will browse through user profiles, screen them, and contact the students\u2019 schools and the schools will validate the student</p>\n<p>Where applicants can: \nBrowse for the nursing homes/hospitals in their area and select the facilities they are interested in\nVolunteer to meetup or talk to their buddy\nDevelop a lasting meaningful relationship and receive community service hours</p>\n<p>Unlike existing social platforms such as Facebook, Connect the Gap allows for faster and more reliable applicant validation through communication between facility staff and schools. Facility staff will screen user profiles based on their criteria to identify the most viable and beneficial candidates based on their personal knowledge of their elderly\u2019s needs, contact the schools for validation and setup the meeting. Facility staff will receive compensation for each meeting they set up since this should count towards improving their quality of care.

We\u2019ve learned through our Pfizer friends that their company, and other like minded companies, are beginning to ofter incentives for people who go out and exercise. This system is hard to manage and companies often have to design their own organizational system. These two ideas allowed us to create: StepScores. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>StepScores is a companion website to the fitbit. Fitbit come with a unique code. Every user will sign up, create an account, and sync their individual fitbit to their account to make sure multiple people cannot use the same fitbit. If a fitbit is lost or someone buys another one, all they must do is change the fitbit code on their account information. </p>\n<p>When the average person uses StepScores, they synchronize their fitbit and create an account. Using fittest own software, we made it so every single day the fitbit will automatically update the information on the website. Fitbit keeps track of all information on their app/website, and we merely use data from fitbit for the individual. Each person can track total steps, daily steps, weekly steps, and yearly steps (along with the averages of each). They can also see graphs of the aforementioned data, and if used for more than a month can see their improvements made. </p>\n<p>Our website allows companies, nationwide, to post prizes and incentives to people for working out. For instance, Starbucks may want to offer a free small coffee to people who, on average, walk 5000 steps a day for 5 days straight. Our website automatically calculates this data. There will be a list of prizes and incentives offered by each company. The prizes will be ordered by the number of steps needed, and companies can offer weekly, daily, or yearly prizes. This list of prizes will show you where you are in accordance with how far you are to completing your goal and being able to redeem your prize. If you like, you can filter prizes based on categories: food, entertainment, or clothing. Every day you can only redeem one daily prize and every week one weekly prize. On the other hand, every year: you can actually unlock all yearly prizes you qualify for. We are incentivizing this country to go out and walk or run, making steps and exercise a form of currency. Most fitbits sold are not worn regularly.  Based on data collected, there are approximately 10 million fitbits used every day by people who want to work out and get in shape. This number is growing rapidly with almost 1 billion dollars in revenue in the last year. Also, fitbits are generally purchased solely with the reason of working out, unlike say an apple watch which people do not use sole for exercise, and unlike a fitbit, is easily tricked into recording additional steps. Thus, this website is not targeted to people who have no desire to work out. But, people who want to work out, and may want an additional incentive(most everyone who wishes to ever work out) will want to connect their fitbit to this website. Rewarding people for working out, incentivizing exercise, and giving people a stronger reason to all work out is a great solution to many health problems in our country. But wait, there\u2019s more!</p>\n<p>Companies want healthy employees. Companies will pay MONEY to promote a healthier lifestyle for their employees. Companies like Pfizer give money back on insurance payments based off of fitbit performance. Organizations, with more than 10 people, will pay our company a fee. What we will do is, create a system that keeps track of all people associated inside the company that have a fitbit. When a company makes a group they send a code to their employees and employees update their account and join the group using the company code. They still keep track of all their steps, see all their data and graphs, and are able to redeem all prizes as before. However, now, companies will have a self updating list that tells them the highest performing employees and most improved employees(that have made true improvements starting with at least 500 steps a day to minimize a null or zero start value or a very insignificant improvement of a small number inflating an improvement percentage). Individuals can see their rankings but not their fellow employees. Also, since companies will want to offer incentives based on performances. On the user's home screen, next to the list of coupons and discounts will be a list of the incentives each company offers based on performance, what one needs in order to get the incentive, and the list, like the national coupon list everyone will see, will highlight where you stand in regards to each incentive and how far away you are from achieving your goals. It also will, as before and as with the larger coupon reward system, show you total steps, daily steps, etc...</p>\n<p>If users wish, in the future, after setting up an account they can be updated once they have reached a certain goal and thus achieved certain prizes. Or they may wish to be alerted when they are close to a certain prize. They may want to know if in a certain day they are only 100 steps away from a free dessert per say. </p>\n<p>We have sign ups for both organization leaders, and individuals.</p>\n<p>This website allows people to keep track of their steps and allows certain organizations to provide incentives to their employees, and other companies to provide incentives and coupons to the general populace in order to encourage a healthier lifestyle. Companies will want to do this to both get people in the door, get free advertisements, and promote healthier living. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using Javascript, Flask, PHP, CSS, Fitbit API, Google charts, photoshop, Ruby on Rails, and Java.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble figuring out how to compute the steps necessary for the reward system with regards to the self updating data. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Honestly, we really like our idea, and our website. We like our design, and how the graph self updates averages that are automatically inputted from fitbit data. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Many of us have never used flask and we have had to learn. That was a rewarding experience as we used it to make self authenticating email verification to create a username that when paired with a fitbit automatically collects data and creates a user profile. We like how it is extremely easy for the user and they do not have to do much, confirm an email really, before this awesome website is completely set up for them. </p>\n<h2>What's next for StepScores</h2>\n<p>Market the idea, add a new email authentication service for companies to send verification codes to employees, figure out how to accept continuous money from companies and store data in sql tables. One thing we may want to change is make it so that long time frame prizes can be set up differently. Currently we have it so that one can claim the weekly prize of 7000 steps during the week just by doing 1000 steps on average for the whole week. Some companies may want to make sure that in order to unlock a prize the person must do a minimum number of steps during each day, so that employees maintain a more consistent rate of exercise. So in this case, company X may want the person to have to walk a minimum of 1000 steps every day, which totals to be 7000 in the entire week, but make sure the person takes requisite steps every single day. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/domain\">domain</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/fitbit\">fitbit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-chart\">google-chart</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dns</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.stepscores.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.stepscores.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.stepscores.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stepscores.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://stepscores.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>stepscores.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Hoekz/hackness-monster\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Hoekz/hackness-monster\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed and implemented our user dashboard.

Sometimes it is difficult for them to go to the doctor. Furthermore, if they go there to run some tests, they just get one value instead of a progression over a longer time period, which would be more useful. This would enable the possibility for early recognition to prevent disease. Also it would help to reduce the consume of drugs, which is a big problem too. During a experiment in the biology labor we had the idea to automatize the process of running test on the urin, which allow severel diagnosis. Therefore we developed the MED-CHECK.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The MED-CHECK is a system which is placed in the back of your toilet. It automatically runs different tests on the urin to measure the pH-value and the present of glucose. By injection of an indicator it is possible to get the values with a photometer. It immediatly returns the value to the database. Also it gets compoared to default values. The access of your data is possible through the website of our device. After the login every user can see the history of his data.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Hardware:\nAt first we designed a CAD model of our device which could be placed in the back of a toilet. For the Hackathon we built a Prototyp of the Measurment part to simulate the tests of urin. It is made out of every available Hardware on the Hackathon. The casing, in which everything is included is made out of package material. It includes a LCD display for instant feedback, buttons to control and to simulate the flush, and the measure unit in a darkroom. The measure unit was built out of an RGB LED and a photoresistor. To get the values for different indicators it is possible to use specific wavelengths. The functionality is like in a real photometer. The whole device is controlled by a arduino 101.</p>\n<p>Software:\nThe software is used to read values from the arduino hardware, and based on the readings comparisons are made to the normal ph value stored in the database. Once the values are read from the database a chart is created where the x axis represents the time at which the value was recorded while the y axis represents the ph value in real time. Different colours are used to represent the ranges of values being mapped.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge for the Hardware were the missing tools, 3D printer and electronic components. Because of that we hat to review our Prototyp adampt our ideas for building and the sensors. We ended up using everything we could find for the Hardware like packages, straws and the woodsticks of starbucks. Reading the values from the database and converting them to a graph format was a very challenging part as well as reading the serial data from the arduino system via python. Especially because we hadn\u00b4t got a ethernet or wifi modul for the arduino. Also the website we created is just running local at the moment.\nA challenge which wasn\u00b4t technical was the language, because sometimes it is difficult to describ complex technical problems.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We got a running measurement system for the pH-value with a visalization. If you some up the costs it would be around 40$ and it is accurate enough for simple applications. The usua measurment systems start at around 600$, so we are pround to get representive values out of our device.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A huge benefit for our team was the variety of our majors. With Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science and Biotechnology, we were able to implement a product which combines hardware as well as software and biological data. Hence, each team member was able to perform and improve his personal occupations and got an insight into different project related areas. Through continuous communication among ourselves we combined the knowledge of out different majors</p>\n<h2>What's next for MED-CHECK</h2>\n<p>The next prototypes will measure more variables and also run the tests automatically. \nAlso there are a lot of other things we want to implement:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>automatically generaten mail to contact in case of irregularity</li>\n<li>user identification (finger print on flush)</li>\n<li>integration in appications like apple health</li>\n<li>check, if older persons took their drugs (inform contact)</li>\n<li>recognice eating habbits and suggest mealplan </li>\n<li>monthly pdf report to doctor</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">siemensnx</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["The software is used to read values from the arduino hardware, and based on the readings comparisons are made to the normal ph value stored in the database.

As we were searching through the particular governmental data, we noticed that much of the information was disorganized and difficult to understand.  Additionally, Medicare provider data has not been visually mapped, to our knowledge.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The project, Geographical Visualization of Medicare Providers, plots the locations of individual providers and organization providers onto a map of the United States and provides detailed information regarding Medicare services and Medicare payments.  Users can filter this information by the state of their interest and discover what providers are within their proximity.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team created this web-app using the statistical programming language, R, and its packages, <code>shiny</code> and <code>leaflet</code>, HTML, and CSS.  Additionally, our members used much of their own blood, sweat, and tears to ensure that the quality of this visualization is clear and easy to understand.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Often times, it was an arduous task to deal with data of over 9 million observations and publish them on a web-app because it takes a lot of time and effort to computationally process the data.  To overcome this, we took a sample from the 9 million observations, a sample of 30 thousand, and continued forward.  Although it may still take a bit of time to load, the web-app ended up being completely functional and a reliable resource for users to understand Medicare data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>None of us killed each other, which is fantastic!  Additionally, all of us survived this weekend trek.  However, we are quite pleased with this fully functional prototype after testing and attempting to crash it multiple times.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Several of us did not think it was possible to come out with this web-app within the given time frame.  Additionally, some of us are not as well-versed in R as others, so it was daunting to approach the task at hand.  However, all of us came out with a new appreciation for R and a more developed understanding of how the language functions as a powerful statistical tool.  Additionally, one of our members found out recently that R can produce efficient web-apps.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Geographical Visualization of Medicare Providers</h2>\n<p>The dataset that we dealt with had much more categorical variables that we could include to further filter the data such as \"provider.type\", \"city.of.the.provider\", and \"HCPCS.code\".  Additionally, we aim to modulate the points on the map, by color and size, to better display differences between provider information so that users can effectively evaluate what provider is best for them.  Whether it is an insurance company or someone receiving Medicare, we hope our future work on this visualization is beneficial and impactful.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">shiny</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://jarrenls.shinyapps.io/Medicare_Map/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://jarrenls.shinyapps.io/Medicare_Map/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>jarrenls.shinyapps.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jarrenLS/Medicare_Map_2014\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jarrenLS/Medicare_Map_2014\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on creating the map using the `leaflet` package in R.

After gathering their data we store it and allow them to view aggregate data for each of our questions. This allows them to keep track of the similarities in their panic attacks and hopefully learn more about what causes them allowing them to hopefully determine a cause and ways to avoid those situations.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Stress Less is built in two components, the iOS application and the web portal. Reiker Seiffe built the iOS entirely native using Research Kit and native Apple libraries. Michael, Maria and Will all worked on the web portal with Will and Maria working on design and frontend and Michael doing the database and backend. In addition we utilized Google charts for the data visualization. The frontend uses the Material Design Lite library for CSS and the backend uses the Laravel framework in order to implement various helper functions to increase the versatility of our application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were some challenges integrating Research Kit and being able to send the data off to our web server. We also ran into some problems integrating our data with the Google Chart API. We also ran into a few issues while considering security. While we did not perfectly follow HIPPA guidelines, we tried our absolute hardest to follow as closely as possible within a weekend. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're extremely proud to have been able to complete an application of this size in only a weekend. We also are really proud that we are able to correctly aggregate data and that it can provide meaningful insights into panic attacks.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Reiker learned how to use Research Kit. We learned just how much work goes into creating any kind of medical application and why we have laws such as HIPPA to protect us.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Stress Less</h2>\n<p>In the future, we would like to offer anonymous data to doctors and medical professionals in a large scale aggregate manner in a way that might help them see how people in their area are dealing with panic attacks. We also want to implement many of the graphs into the iOS application. We would like to add additional data visualizations in the future</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">research-kit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-chart\">google-chart</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://stresslessportal.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://stresslessportal.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>stresslessportal.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wmock561/ArchHacks-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/wmock561/ArchHacks-2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["ArchHacks2016_Bluetooth", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ArchHacks2016_Bluetooth \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/444/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Android Device tracking bluetooth signals</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanted to test the capabilities of Bluetooth on a device.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A user with a phone can be accurately tracked in 2D space on the ground using their phone \nand three other \"beacon\" devices that use trilateration to triangulate their position via Bluetooth.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Used three Intel-Edison devices and their Bluetooth as the beacons and a user phone such as an android\nthat gets tracked by the Edisons.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Very very difficult to get accurate distance measurements to each bluetooth device.

It would really help the doctors not only by the medical check up at the hospitals, but also with their daily activities. This platform is meant to serve this purpose.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The work was divided into two parts :</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Hardware</li>\n<li>Using Bio sensor acquisition device. When the user triggers the acquisition device, it collects the desired bio-medical sensor data and pushes it to the cloud hosted on Intel Edison using MQTT protocol. The server stores the data to the database.</li>\n<li>System development<br/></li>\n<li>We allow the user to add the data acquired from the hardware above to their profile.\nThe system also allows users to integrate data from various wearable devices like Fitbit, Google Fit, Any other Sensor based data, external api etc. These devices can be added/removed at any time, and latest data can be fetched automatically. This creates a user profile, where in he/she can view there daily progress across devices /sensors on a single portal. A potential functionality of this application is to allow particular super users (in this case, physician or a medical representative) to access the user's data.

We are using state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques/APIs to help sick patients get diagnosed from the comfort of their home. Dr. AI is a chatbot that will take your particulars and symptoms and connect you with a real doctor that will use our pre-calculated diagnosis to quickly and accurately diagnose you. If necessary, the doctor might also recommend the patient to visit a doctor in-person or a pharmacy with a prescription. For this, we identify the users' location and suggest the 5 best doctors in the vicinity according to the diagnosis. </p>\n<p>Currently, we have a bot that diagnoses a patient based on the personal details and symptoms. </p>\n<h2>Working Functionality</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Talk to a Nurse Bot</li>\n<li>Initial Diagnosis based on the symptoms</li>\n<li>Probability of the diagnosis</li>\n<li>Best recommended doctors in the area</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Future Work</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We are currently working on an interactive app/web application (with GUI).</li>\n<li>Create a real-time chat application that connects patients with doctors directly after diagnosis.</li>\n<li>Incorporate our bot to handle mundane/standard work (i.e. collecting particulars/symptoms, passing info to doctor).</li>\n<li>Come up with list of nearby pharmacies for the user.</li>\n<li>Greatly improve accuracy of diagnosis prediction.</li>\n<li>Create a prescription delivery system where patient can get medicine delivered to them.</li>\n<li>Create a database of the patients for a smoother user experience.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the best user-experience and more accurate diagnosis we strongly recommend you to follow the following steps while interacting with the Nurse bot.</p>\n<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Please provide us with your full name</li>\n<li>Please type in your gender as either 'male' or 'female'.</li>\n<li>Please provide the symptoms as accurately as possible.</li>\n<li>Press enter once to put in the next symptom and twice to see your diagnosis.</li>\n<li>Finally book an appointment before contacting the doctor for futher analysis of your symptoms.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kausik93/archhacks16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kausik93/archhacks16\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Express Medicine", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Medicine \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/290/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Designing_Progress 1</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Medicine \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/291/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Product_face_view</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Medicine \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/292/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Product_out_side_view</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Medicine \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/293/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Product_in_side_view</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Medicine \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/294/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Designing_Progress3</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Medicine \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/295/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Designing_Progress2</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration of the design is that one of the people in our team, Yutao Hu, caught a cold last month. He went to hospital. He waited 30 minus in Purdue Pharmacy Center to wait for the medicine. He think the efficiency of the medical system is too low. \nOur design is a vending machine that can help enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the medicine receiving process. The design applied the facial recognition technology to recognize patient quickly. The average reacting time is less than 1 minutes each person. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We will build a folder for each of the patients in the hospital server. When a patient comes to our hospital, doctor would make a database for new incoming patient, or load previous database for previous patient.  To simulate the process of  interrogation\uff0ca GUI is created. The doctors can input the basic personal information and photo easily using the GUI. The prescription will be stored together with the information of the patients.</p>\n<p>The medicine distribution machine has a camera that used to take pictures of patients. Then the data is sent to the server of the system and the return value will be used to drive the machine to distributing the corresponding medicine to the patients. The patients can get their medicine by using our machine by following the instructions on another GUI based on Raspberry and LCD display.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The first step is to step up the machine. Raspberry pi and Arduino boards are used as the controller in the machine. The raspberry pi take charge of controlling the machine and communicating with other device. LCD display is used to provide information to patients and receive instruction. Arduino boards are applied to drive the servo. The GUI of the system is created by Kivy library. The connection of the net work is created by the ssh in the local net work.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge I met was that how to use hardware interrupts with software. The communication between the software and hardware is hard. The problems with hardware also gives me a lot of trouble. The torque of my servo is not stability. It is hard for me to vending the machine with that. I used the Raspberry pi, Arduino and some other sensors. The supply voltages are different. It is hard to implement them together.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully made the design in the given time. We still up all nights in the two days to finish the design. I finished hardware part which I have never tried before.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>It is my first time to do a project on Microprocessor and I never use python before. I got some experience in digital design and I learnt a little bit python. Besides that, I learnt how to use the ssh to setup local network between different computers.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Express Medication</h2>\n<p>Firstly, other method should be used to make the design more accurate. Now, we use higher threshold value for the face detect, but one method is not enough for biomedical application in which no mistake is allowed.\nSecond, we need to use better data analysis system. The system should contains more information about the patients,<br/>\nwhich have a high  potential in salvage. In the emergence situation, the doctor can save more life if they do not have to spend time on inspection. \nThird, the machine parts of the design should be improved. None of us has experience in ME. We need find better parts for our design. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kivy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the raspberry PI GUI and part of the doctor software.

While modern-day smartphones, laptops, and tablets have amazing capabilities, many elderly people face the problem of not being able to understand the interface of accessing them.</p>\n<p>We were able to get an Amazon Echo, Intel Edison, and an Arduino for this hackathon and we though a voice-based interface would help cross this accessibility barrier. This tool currently has two main capabilities: managing a list of medications to take and fall detection. Using the arduino we wrote a script that detects rapid changes in acceleration and triggers the Echo to ask if the user is okay, and if not, is able to call whoever is necessary (note: this is not currently enabled but could be in the future with Twilio integration). For those who aren't able to keep track of all of their medications, we built a tool that allows a user to create a list for them.

By giving patients ownership of their data, we reduce hospital inefficiency, improve patient outcomes, and help create more informed patients.</p>\n<h1>Who we are:</h1>\n<p>Jeremiah Milbauer \u2014 Computer Science and Philosophy Undergrad at The University of Chicago\nOsama El-Sayed \u2014 MD/PhD student at the university of Illinois at Chicago COM\nHannah Pennington \u2014MD/PhD student at the university of Illinois at Chicago COM\nNavin Weiss \u2014 Software Engineering Undergrad at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology</p>\n<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n<p>One of our group members had a difficult experience while hospitalized in the last year. Although the hospital used a centralized database, he had to repeat his entire medical history every time he met a new care team. Aside from being frustrating to remember all that information, it can be emotionally taxing to feel like the central coordinator for your care. We wanted to create a platform that makes this experience less stressful for patients, and streamlined for physicians.</p>\n<h1>Other Advantages</h1>\n<p>Relying on patients to recall their medical histories introduces inefficiencies into the healthcare system. It can waste the patients\u2019 time, and the doctors\u2019 time: time that is both expensive and all-important for offering quality care.</p>\n<p>Not every patient has access to information and resources to learn about their healthcare. By creating a platform that allows patients to better understand and manage their healthcare situation, we can give more and more people access to information that can improve their quality of life and quality of care.</p>\n<p>This platform also helps patients transfer information between physicians that use different database systems, allowing for greater continuity of care.</p>\n<p>This platform also offers distinct advantages to low-income users. This segment of the population often uses the emergency room as primary care. Studies have shown that increasing continuity of care for these patients leads to significantly better outcomes. Additionally, low-income patients often have the most complex complications accompanying their disease, and keeping track of these additional complications and symptoms offers a distinct advantage.</p>\n<h1>How we built it!</h1>\n<p>We built an iOS app using Swift in Xcode.\nNone of us had built for iOS before \u2014\u00a0so this was an exciting experience!</p>\n<p>From the user\u2019s perspective, the app is fairly simple. Users are greeted with a log-in page, where they can either enter the profile of an existing user, create a new user, or enter as a physician.\nWhen creating a new user profile, patients enter a simple baseline of information and medical history, similar to what they would enter when first registering at a new hospital.\nOnce a user navigates to their profile, they have four categories of information: \u201cPersonal History\u201d, \u201cMedications\u201d, \u201cGeneral Info\u201d, \u201cNotifications\u201d. These categories were chosen for the specific advantages they offer both patients and physicians in understanding the medical records.</p>\n<p>Under the hood, we use a data structure system that stores patients as structs and associates a huge amount of information on visits, diagnoses, physicians seen, procedures undergone, medications administered, etc. This information is not always displayed to the patient \u2014\u00a0that would be overwhelming \u2014 but is always there so that a physician can see the gritty details of the patient\u2019s medical history.</p>\n<h1>Marketability</h1>\n<p>This app would primarily be marketed towards hospitals and insurance providers. Hospitals would be benefited from increased efficiency of care, and insurance providers are benefited by improved outcomes and logistic streamlining. Of course patients would be benefited as well, but the goal of the app would be to offer the basic functionality to every user without cost.</p>\n<h1>Going Forward</h1>\n<p>Security &amp; HIPAA\n     We would love to improve the security of our platform, but that was not a priority in this time-crunch weekend.\n    With regards to HIPAA, the platform as it stands never takes information out of the patients hands \u2014\u00a0so it\u2019s not a major concern.\nPhysician Verification\n    Although it is important to give patients access and ownership of their medical records, we don\u2019t want patients to be able to abuse this. Each visit and diagnosis on the platform is associated with a physician, so future healthcare providers can confirm diagnosis and past treatment with the original physician.\n    We\u2019re really excited about exploring other was to handle this verification\nInformation Sharing\n    It would be nice if patients could actually share their app-data with their doctors. Doing this, however, introduces a slew of HIPAA concerns. It\u2019s definitely a technical challenge we\u2019re eager to approach \u2014\u00a0and we\u2019ve started laying the foundations of the physician-side of the app, which could be used for managing a variety of patient records.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hmeghan621/TheOne\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hmeghan621/TheOne\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android version in the hopes that we could develop a cross-platform application.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Many people do not have access to basic healthcare due to lack of money, transportation or resources. The government allocates a large sum of money to companies which provide and manage the free healthcare that is provided to these people. If a person is rated as \"high risk\", the company currently invests a lot of money in a personalized preventative care plan, which tries to save money in the long run by taking early steps to treat the problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We have developed a managed care solution that uses big data technologies to proactively prevent medical emergencies.\nWe work around data in these 4 steps:\nCollect -&gt; Analyze -&gt; Deliver -&gt; Communicate\nThe best part about the process is that it is a cycle, in that after we communicate the data, we need to go back and collect more data and the whole process starts over. This shows that our solution is scalable, sustainable and self-sufficient.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Collect: We designed our very own smart wearable device using an arduino, intel edison, GPS, some sensors and a Wi-Fi shield.</li>\n<li>Analyze: We developed a big data algorithm to analyze the data. To do this, we wrote a data processing algorithm which finds patterns in the database using Python.</li>\n<li>Deliver: We developed a web app where the doctor will be able to log in and see the patient's data. This was built using Ruby on Rails to write the web app dashboard, bootstrap to design the front end and mySQL to handle the database.</li>\n<li>Communicate: The doctor will be able to use the same web app he is already logged into, to securely send messages to the patient and receive replies. This was built using node.js for the chat app within the web app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Since we are working with very personal patient data, in order to meet important government regulations (such as HIPAA), all the data this is transferred throughout this process will be encrypted.</li>\n<li>Only raw data will be used during the analysis step, when the algorithm examines the data to make the predictive model.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Providing an end-to-end solution for the under-privileged, less educated &amp; elderly (people who do not have any experience with technologies). This means we had to ensure that the overall process is minimal, does not require the patient to do anything and is easy for anyone to use.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The overall healthcare business model and how important it is to have early detection technologies readily available to the general population.</li>\n<li>An incentive to the population is that they periodically get a free partial checkup using an easy-to-use device.</li>\n<li>An incentive to medical professionals is it saves time by allowing them to diagnose patients online</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Project BigDoc</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work with the government to distribute the smart wearable to these high risk patients, all over the country, for free.</li>\n<li>Target healthcare enterprises who are spending a lot of money on preventative care and show them our complete packaged solution.</li>\n<li>Reach out to medical professionals to get them on board our web app through which they can view the data and communicate effectively with their patients.</li>\n<li>Add different kinds of sensors to get more data that will be used to make an even stronger database, more accurate trend charts and a better predictive model.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gps\">gps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gyroscope</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/accelerometer\">accelerometer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">matplotlib</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">flaskapis</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bigdoc.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bigdoc.me/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bigdoc.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bigdoc/bigdoc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bigdoc/bigdoc\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I planned and implemented many ideas and features for the solution.

He was so forgetful he thought he was a cat. Clearly, he also forgot his medication. The team at r3mind were worried for his sanity so they decided to make life a little bit easier for him.</p>\n<p>Enter r3mind.me. This revolutionary website takes the guesswork out of figuring out which medicine pills Dalv should be buying even though he just entered them into the brilliant website. It also makes figuring out how many total pills to buy much simpler, since Dalv has forgotten multiplication as well.</p>\n<p>Using revolutionary HTML/CSS coding, the team was able to make simple, yet intuitive webpage. The team's radical use of JavaScript allowed them to create a script that actually did what the team set out to do.</p>\n<p>This endeavor the team set out on was not with out its own issues. The r3mind team had grand visions of getting real-time drug pricing and using the Google Calendar API to help Dalv get the best possible aid for his afflictions. However, with their time and talent constraints, as well as having various spirited intellectual discussions, they were not able to fully implement their back-end structure to tie in with the front-end. As greedy as were to not use their own system resources, the team decided to move as much as possible to the front end which solved some of their problems.</p>\n<p>The team accomplished a lot over the short amount. They learned that by doing the most minimal amount of work together as possible, they gained a greater return on investment. This disruptive method they developed was subsequently coined B.U.L.L.S.H.*.T (don't worry about what it means they'll figure it out later).</p>\n<p>The team's creation has earned some very high praises from international tech critics around the world. Some have even called r3mind.me the next wolfram alpha due to the innovative multiplier function they B.U.L.L.S.H.*.T-ed. </p>\n<p>The team learned that they were more than capable of tackling the world's most pressing issues and using their methods and expertise, they would help make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>The r3mind team has moved on to greater challenges such as controlling and modifying the bear-like behavior which Dalv exibits, how to attain more brand-named laptop stickers to attain higher CPU clock speeds, and most importantly to help Dalv get his sh*t together by first making sure he understands his name is Sergey (d&amp;mn*t Vlad...

Family members are the ones that care the most about our health. Our grandparents and elderly loved ones  live far away from us and often alone. Their mobile phones, blood pressure meters, blood glucose meters and other such devices give and record diverse health data and are connected to the internet. We want people to be able to monitor the health of their loved ones remotely and provide the help that is needed. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FamilyHealthWatch has individual dashboards for every person in the family. These dashboards visualize the health data collected by the smart devices and wearables. Our app also has a smart comprehensive dashboard that shows all family members' health data and gives intuitive notifications to the user, all of this in a simple and easy to use web application. </p>\n<p>Elderly people have a lot of health problems both physically and mentally that they do not disclose. However, their need can be identified by observing abnormalities in their step count, blood glucose levels, heartbeat, medication, sleeping habits, activities etc. It also gives the locations  of doctors/hospitals around, their upcoming doctor appointments on a calendar and a super easy platform to chat with your loved ones. You can also set your activity goals in the personal dashboard.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>When dealing with health data, there are tons of implications about how to collect the data, how that data can be stored and transmitted. Human API is a third-party API provider which is responsible for the integration of data from various devices collecting them in a secure way and encrypting the data in the cloud. We query the Human API the data we need via a secure HTTP connection for the data we need which authenticates the users via an access token. We DO NOT store any data on the system, the data we get from Human API is used to build a mathematical model that can be used for detecting patterns in the data, predict trends and abnormalities etc.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Elderly parents living alone and far away is a common scenario in both high-income and low-income families, sensors are getting cheaper and cheaper and a device that measures the blood glucose/blood pressure is $30, step count and heart rate tracking devices come for as low as 15$, when so much of data is available, people should be able to take good care of their loved ones and help them remotely. There are apps like FitBit social and Apple Activity sharing, which add competitive value to improve health but there is no app that is exclusively for family and loved ones, adding to the care-giving and motivational value.</p>\n<h2>Whats next for FamilyHealthWatch</h2>\n<p>The widgets that our dashboard can handle cannot be just limited to wearables, if integrated with the motion, temperature and air quality sensors in the house, more information can be used to build models which enable better prediction of trends.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">async.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">fullcalandar.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">human-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.familyhealthwatch.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.familyhealthwatch.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.familyhealthwatch.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Lexi", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Lexi \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/700/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Lexi \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/709/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>For individuals with dyslexia and dyslexia and other reading disabilities, every word can be a struggle. According to the American Dyslexia Association, as many as 40 Million Americans suffer from dyslexia, most of whom have not been diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the vast majority will never receive treatment, either because testing is too expensive, or because they simply don't know that they have a treatable condition. These individuals are told that they're stupid, lazy, or just not trying hard enough, when the reality is that they have a medical condition which can be treated, though not cured.</p>\n<p>In particular, children from low-income backgrounds are among the most affected, because they lack access to the educational and medical resources that are critical to managing reading disabilities. Without the professional support and reading strategies that come with diagnosis, undiagnosed students lag behind their peers, as they struggle to learn from books and communicate their ideas to others. These students simply fall through the cracks.</p>\n<p>We believe it doesn't have to be that way.</p>\n<p><strong>Enter Lexi:</strong>  a mobile keyboard application that allows teachers to identify students that may have dyslexia in an easy and cost-effective way.

These have also been shown to be vulnerable as well.  Although not as easily available to hackers as a RESTful web interface, an NFC device is still vulnerable to something analogous to packet sniffing.  In addition to this, NFC devices might be inconvenient for patients and consumers.</p>\n<p>Although transfer of data through sound has similar issues to NFC devices, it is not constantly broadcasting a signal in the way that NFC devices do.  In addition to this, a receptionist can keep a 2-way aux cable to create a completely closed network.</p>\n<p>Not many technologies projects or products leverage the transfer of data through sound, so this app is fairly innovative in its approach to securely transferring data, and could be a good proof of concept for similar future technologies.</p>\n<h2>The Software Stack</h2>\n<p>The patient's mobile app was implemented with Ionic, the receptionist's laptop/desktop app was implemented with Electron, and the sound communication was implemented with QuietJS.</p>\n<h2>Potential Future Functionality</h2>\n<p>This project was primarily focused on the secure communication aspect of using electronic data storage to improve the efficiency of healthcare practitioners.\nTo further contribute to what ModemCare has the potential to bring to healthcare practitioners, ModemCare could be extended to integrate with Electronic Medical Records or provide more standardized and customizable forms to fit the needs of each individual practitioner.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electron</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PascalRascal/ModemCare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PascalRascal/ModemCare\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Created the front-end design and logos and worked on some of the AngularJS compnents", "I worked on AngularJS components for the team's ionic mobile app and electron desktop app", "Created Desktop companion app and worked on data transmission and reception"]], ["Check-i", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Check-i \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/661/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Check-i \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/660/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Going to the doctor is time consuming for some, and for others is very expensive.

We use arduino with an NPX NFC module to read RFID or NFC cards. The arduino takes this Unique ID and sends it via serial to a Raspberry Pi. The raspberry pi will pull data from our database (which can be updated via an interface by pharmacists/doctors) and determine what pills need to be taken today.

That stress followed me later in life, and even today I don't feel comfortable talking to my doctor about personal information, potential concerns, or even go to my recommended checkups. This problem goes beyond just my own personal experiences. According to the CDC, 16.8% of adults haven't seen a health care professional in the last year. That's more than 1 out of 6 individuals, one in six who are at risk to a multitude of curable diseases that could all be solved if they simply talked to their doctor. I can't blame them, but if there was a way to break the communication barrier between doctor to patient, a way that allows people to get early care, for doctors to intelligently learn more about their patients habits without the embarrassment, nervousness, or fear of going to the doctors, then that should be something we undeniably pursue.</p>\n<p>We grew our app off of that idea, \"How can we make communicating with your doctor fun, pleasant, satisfying?\" It's one of the world's biggest advertising challenges, and Sup Doc was our attempt to solve it. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We wanted to create a system that rewards constant communications with your doctor - a system that helps facilitate a relationship with your physician. Conceptually our plan was to give patients and doctors access to information about each other, a way to sort of pave a 2 way street of communication. By offering entertainment rewards for constant communication we hoped to promote a friendly type of communication with your doctor. Furthermore, our app planned to prompt users with daily questions that would prompt users to think about their health, and give them a space to raise any potential concerns. Those answers would be forwarded to their doctor's wall, allowing the doctor to easily browse through all of his patient's concerns.</p>\n<p>Of course apps like this ride entirely on the ease of use, efficiency of the system, and quality feeling of the website, so it was also vital that our app looked good along the way.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Sup Doc for the most part remains unfinished.</p>\n<p>Sup Doc was built using angularjs, firebase, materializecss, html, and JQuery.

We hope that some of these future ideas result in some cool apps down the line that really help to make a difference.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Outside of the importance of sleep, we learned how to make the basic implementation of angular, firebase, and materialize, and how all these web technologies interacted with one another.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sup Doc</h2>\n<p>Currently, Sup Doc will most likely remain unfinished, the basic implementation of the app is so far from completion that it makes little sense to continue with the original product in mind.

While the pace of walking on a flat surface is staggered and interrupted, the continuous motion of using a staircase--or even the illusion of a staircase--can enable a person with Parkinson\u2019s to walk with a regular gait. And while many encounter difficulty extending an arm to interact with an object, the introduction of a moving target provides an active stimulus that prompts a response.</p>\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg5M3J_FHXY\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for the inspiration behind our project (3:45 - 5:05).</p>\n<p>We thought: What if we take this painted staircase illusion and apply it <em>anywhere in the world</em>?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Amviewlate (a riff on \"ambulate\" and \"view\") assists with two key problems: </p>\n<p><em>Freezing of gait</em>, an ambulatory disturbance that results in slow, shuffled walking</p>\n<p><em>Dyskinesia</em>, the impairment of voluntary movement, particularly without stimuli to trigger reflexes</p>\n<p>Amviewlate projects visual cues in augmented reality to facilitate walking and interacting with objects. A staircase illusion helps simulate the act of climbing stairs, enabling continuous motion. A visual cue guides the hand to an intended target. All actions are governed by voice control software to enable full agency in users with limited gesture control. Through Amviewlate, we hope to restore mobility, independence, and confidence in our users.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For this project, we quickly set up an AR application using Google Cardboard and a marker recognizer library called Vuforia. The next challenge was to integrate speech recognition as part of the app. There were no free Android speech recognizer assets available on Unity, so we had to build one ourselves by integrating Android plug-ins to the Unity project. Finally, we set up the whole scene in the application to provide a compelling experience for people with Parkinson's disease.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into several challenges while developing Amviewlate. It was important to us to incorporate voice controls to help people with Parkinson\u2019s (who have trouble with precise gesture controls) navigate the AR experience. However, connecting the Android speech recognizer with Unity and exporting to a phone proved challenging.</p>\n<p>Even after building the speech recognition library onto the phone, we realized we weren\u2019t able to trigger the AR effects from voice alone without a preceding cue to trigger the phone to listen for certain words or phrases. </p>\n<p>Building the 3D AR effects was also challenging, as none of us were skilled at 3D modeling, so finding and adjusting 3D models required some trial and error. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team hacked together a myriad of libraries and technologies to create a unique experience, bringing powerful speech recognition and augmented reality technology to any smartphone via Google Cardboard. </p>\n<p>Through guerrilla research of academic papers and testimonials about Parkinson\u2019s disease, as well as paper prototyping of the AR interactions, our team broke down and addressed specific problems unique to Parkinson\u2019s patients. This research guided the three key interactions built into the final AR prototype: The stair illusion to walk steadily on flat surfaces, the stomping animation to aid in making sharp turns, and the ball catching illusion to grab objects.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about the rich research literature on assistive technology for Parkinson\u2019s disease. We found several videos and papers describing specific visual cues (such as the staircase illusion) which help with motor control for people with Parkinson\u2019s. While developing the app, we learned which of the cues best lent themselves to being recreated with augmented reality. </p>\n<p>We also learned how to apply AR and speech recognition tools to an Android app. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Amviewlate</h2>\n<p>While the Google Cardboard has the benefit of using lightweight, affordable technology (a smartphone and a mobile headset), the spatial recognition capabilities are limited. In our demo, we got around this by using the Vuforia library to trigger AR effects based on image targets placed throughout a space. However, using VR headsets with spatial recognition would enable us to generate the AR effects dynamically using computer vision to recognize paths, passageways, and obstacles in an environment. Luckily, better spatial recognition is within reach with the next generation of AR headsets, such as the Hololens or Metavision. </p>\n<p>We are also eager to validate and iterate on our AR prototype through consultations with medical specialists as well as user testing with people with Parkinson\u2019s disease.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vuforia\">vuforia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["In this project, I quickly set up on the first day an AR application using a Google Cardboard and a Marker Recognizer library called Vuforia.

Taking multivariable data inputs, we are able to see connections that were not obvious to the user.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Unity game engine to plot the data points and allow the user to move around through the data. They can move around through it, and using the Oculus Rift can see a full 360 degree view of their surrounding data points. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first laptop we had would not install the Oculus software, so that set us back several hours. Then we got a desktop that didn't have the right cables for its monitor. We then ran into several challenges using the Unity 3D engine, namely how to add more than one data set (linking sets to each other in one program), .</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning the unity 3D engine (none of us had experience with coding in unity before). We found interesting correlations in the data we used using our technique. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Some general conclusions that we can draw from the data that we analyzed during this project:</p>\n<p>Substance Abuse Data </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Males drink more than females.</li>\n<li>If school doesn't matter to the student, students drink more</li>\n<li>If school does matter, the students GPA is higher, and they drink less. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Lung Cancer Data </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Incidence rate is highest for Black males</li>\n<li>White males are the second highest</li>\n<li>Poverty rate and incidence rate show strong correlation. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>We learned a lot about Unity and data exploration. We learned how to clean up data and how to draw meaningful conclusions from it. Dividing up work was also a huge learning experience. It required a lot of thought to select the right task for the right person. The biggest chunk of the learning process was how to handle working in a virtual space with the Oculus. It is difficult, but using this technology during this hackathon we understand that the future is bright for many applications. </p>\n<h2>What's next for ImmersiveViz</h2>\n<p>Allow users to pick more dimensions such as shape of a data point, individual coloration of data points, clustering effects, particle effects, and scene linking in unity so that you can see all of your data sets in real time at a click of a button. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked with team member Luis finding several data sets, cleaning data in R, and several different tasks in Unity.

Whether due to time constraints, isolated location, restricted mobility, or insufficient income, difficulty in getting to a doctor is a widely faced challenge with serious health consequences. The original concept stemmed specifically from the issues faced by people with little access to transportation to the hospital, but we soon realized that it could be used for so much more. The technology to check one's own individual vitals is already out in the commercial space and with the added technology of the cloud, transporting this data is easier than ever before. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our design concept was born when we realized that several electronic wrist watches available today already possess the capability to monitor various individual vital signs of the wearer. Heart rate monitors are standard in most smart watches, and there are thermometers, blood pressure monitors, and even oxidation monitors in wrist watches currently on the market. We decided combine these devices and include a few additional technologies to provide patients with a way to send data to their doctors and have a virtual doctor\u2019s appointment from their own homes. The idea of the home check-up is the core idea of the project, it can be easily expanded to great effect. Elderly people who cannot leave their homes or do not want to go to the doctor could be assisted by caretakers or family members in utilizing Doctor Go to receive quality medical care from their doctors despite limited mobility with minimal strain on interpersonal relationships. Speaking of family members, Doctor Go could provide lower-income families with the means to ensure that all members can track their vital signs and conference with doctors without the heavy costs associated with transportation and appointment scheduling.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Inexperience and little access to the required hardware</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>The idea is innovative and generally unexplored in the industry and we have networked with several ArchHacks sponsors in order to achieve a more complete vision of our product. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how far you can take an idea despite limited hardware capability, and the power of collaborative feedback from experienced professionals in the field. We also gained a lot of knowledge through our research about current smart tech and wearables that can read vitals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I researched the feasibility of the product and presented the product.", "I designed the interface and created graphics.", "I helped in constructing the graphics and the presentation.

Although we had many ideas, we couldn't settle on one that had the impact we were looking for, in the health space we were concerned with, and that helped the most people at the smallest cost. As we talked about project ideas, one thing led to another and we stated talking about our college experience, and one thing was universal among the whole team. We were stressed. That got us thinking about mental health on the whole, and the fact that therapy sessions can cost $50 to <em>$240</em> an hour on average! The truth is, treatment for mental health is out of reach for many people, so we wanted to create something that strove to offer mini therapy sessions at the lowest possible cost. Virtuheal was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Virtuheal has many functions, but primarily it creates a virtual world that patients can interact with in soothing ways. It includes functionality which allows users to pick the intensity of their therapy session, provide feedback on how they were feeling and why they reached out for therapy, and most importantly a live peer therapy function which connects patients to other therapists and patients to help them cope in the moment. Virtuheal also has a tactile aspect, which provides rhythmic vibrations into the palm based on the intensity of therapy and emotion of the patient, a proven technique to add physical accompaniment to the visual stimuli. As well, Virtuheal collects heart-beat data on the patient to help provide information to the patient and to their live therapist in gauging their mood and level of anxiety.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Virtual has three main aspects, the virtual world, the web app, and the physical sensors and outputs. The virtual world primarily uses leap-motion technology to render objects and allow users to interact with them in the virtual landscape. The web app uses HTML5, javascript, CSS, and a number of other programs and languages to render the website, collect and post data to and from the physical sensors, and facilitated the live peer conversations. The physical aspect utilizes Arduino technology, vibration motors, and a infrared heart-beat sensor to interact with and monitor the user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Wow, there were many! The leap-motion library had almost no documentation, and in many places there was no documentation for some function or simply the statement that \"the software is a work in progress, please be patient.\" The vibration motor broke at about 1:00 Sunday morning, meaning that two teammates had to run to CVS and break open vibrating toothbrushes to steal their vibration motors (yup, you read that right). Regardless of all the challenges, we had a great time and are excited to share Virtuheal with the world!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>Again, so many. The late night vibrating toothbrush massacre was one of the best, the incredible logo is really something to be proud of, and of course the absolutely amazing implementation of virtual software in only 36 hours was really an amazing feat of dedication and creativity. Most of all, however, I'm proud of the team we had built over the last two days. Although most of us had never met before, we came together and did something great with the time we had, and together we hope that you will find Virtuheal as relaxing and intriguing as we do</p>\n<h2>What's next for Virtuheal</h2>\n<p>In the future, we hope to expand the number of scenarios we can offer to patients. Clean up and minimize the bulky physical glove. increase the functionality and graphics of the virtual world, and continue to improve and tailor the therapeutic aspects of Virtuheal.</p>\n<h2>PS</h2>\n<p>If you want to try it out for yourself, you'll need a Leap Motion device, which can be rented from MLH for free or bought here: <a href=\"https://www.leapmotion.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.leapmotion.com/</a> <br/>\nHappy Healing! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/peerjs\">peerjs</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rajatmehndiratta/PeerTherapy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rajatmehndiratta/PeerTherapy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["broke apart electric toothbrushes at 3 am so we could have vibration motors; shout-out to jarrek for being incredibly resourceful", "Back end, front-end, and design for the web application", "", ""]], ["PopClinic", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PopClinic \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/357/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Main Logo!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PopClinic \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/352/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PopClinic \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/353/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PopClinic \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/354/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PopClinic \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/355/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Centene mentioned the important of bringing healthcare to people, as those in poor economic situations often cannot make it to their primary healthcare providers.

We start from a common eye disease called corneal ulcer, which affects 2-10% of populations and requires prompt treatment. The major challenge lies in the monitoring process of the treatment procedure, which remains manual and hence time consuming and prone to human errors. We wanted to develop an app that provides an easier way for patients and doctors to track their recovery progress effectively. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>EyeCare</strong> is a mobile app aiming to help people who are suffering from corneal ulcers and epithelial defects. Not only being able to record and track a patient's recovery progress, <strong>EyeCare</strong> can also provide reliable automatic detection on any picture taken by an iPhone with a 15 - 25 magnifying lens. A patient can ask a person to take a picture using his smartphone with a 15 magnifying lens. <strong>EyeCare</strong> is able to detect the ulcer region on the patient's cornea and compute the defected area precisely. Patients will be presented with a comparison of their original picture and a new picture with the segmented defected area being highlighted. All tested photos will be stored on our server so that each user will be able to access their records everywhere through our mobile app. <strong>EyeCare</strong> will also generate a plot of the defected area to show the healing process. In addition, the physician can also user our web app to access and analyze his/her patients' data, therefore, the physician will be able to diagnose this disease more efficiently and remotely. Compare to traditional detection, our new approach is significantly less expensive and easier to perform. </p>\n<p>Segmentation:\n<img alt=\"alt\" data-canonical-url=\"http://ec2-54-173-183-10.compute-1.amazonaws.com/siphon2/uploads/slide%20images/segmentation_process.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--mKxDRz_d--/http://ec2-54-173-183-10.compute-1.amazonaws.com/siphon2/uploads/slide%2520images/segmentation_process.png\"/></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Thanks to all the awesome technologies and libraries, we were able to build this rather complex app in less than 48 hours.

In order to perform detection in real-time, we spent a lot of time to optimize our algorithm. Another challenge we ran into is to setup Mathematica on an Amazon Ubuntu instance and hook it up with our PHP backend. It turned out the setup process is not trivial. We spent quite some time to install all the required packages and troubleshoot problems we have never seen. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Super Fast: Detection and computation of ulcer region for each image (1-1.5MB) only takes 2.3 seconds</li>\n<li>My original implementation of the core algorithm is approximately 1000 - 1500 lines (based on Professor's requirement - like we cannot use many built-in functions, everything needs to be written from scratch, which is useful because ), but after optimization and make full use of Mathematica built-in function, it's only approximately 100 lines.</li>\n<li>I implement Iris Detection within 2 hours, I abandoned it eventually because there are too much computations of this algorithm which takes 5 minutes for one image. But I used to need at least 10 hours to understand an algorithm from paper and do protoyping. This time is fast due to the deadline. I will implement it again in C++. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How to setup Mathematica and deploy our backend on a AWS Ubuntu server.</li>\n<li>Mathematica built-in functions are extremely fast. I guess it calls C++.

Compared to the rest of the health industry, ambulances and other emergency vehicles have been lagging far behind in terms of client-minded software innovation. The only time you know when an ambulance is coming your way is when it's right behind you, sirens blaring and causing commotion and distractions. In many cases, this can cause crashes and delay response times greatly. SafetyFirst aims to reduce these accidents by alerting drivers ahead of time, so that they can be prepared to move out of the way.</p>\n<p>When an emergency vehicle is dispatched, their route is generally predetermined to help them get to the incident as fast as possible. Knowing this, we integrated our software with google maps so that there would be a way to alert drivers when an ambulance is in your area and will crossing your route. It will be used as a more effective alert system so that civilians have more time to react before they see the lights in their rear view mirror. This will allow for much safer and more efficient trips to emergency sites not only decreasing the time to patient but cutting down on creating any more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-speech-api\">google-web-speech-api</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Thembro01/SafetyFirst\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Thembro01/SafetyFirst\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Jared's Choice", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by websites that provide random places to eat based on your location.

Nearly one million people in the US are living with Parkinson's disease. The cause is unknown, and although there is presently no cure, there are treatment options such as medication and surgery to manage its symptoms. Currently, there aren\u2019t many tools to diagnose this disease.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Parkinson's Diagnostic tool (PDT) helps us to detect whether a person is suffering from parkinson or not. Tremoring is one of the common symptoms for this disease. To diagnose the disease, we  collect the position (x,y,z coordinates), acceleration  and speed of one\u2019s tremoring using their phone\u2019s accelerometer. With the help of machine learning we decide whether the collected data resembles the tremors that characterize Parkinson's disease..</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We built an android app to collect the 3 dimensional co-ordinates along with the acceleration and speed every 100 millisecond by holding the phone in your hands or attaching it to your wrist</li>\n<li>We built api\u2019s using python and exposed it over the internet by using Amazon web services. These api\u2019s were used by the android app to either send the training data or the data for prediction.</li>\n<li>We made use of octave to build up the neural network with forward and back propagation which has 500 input layers(coordinates, speed and acceleration of a tremor), 25 hidden layers used to predict more complex features with the features already available and 2 output units predicting if the test was positive or negative for parkinson. We used the training set collected using the android app and passed on to the server with the python api. Similarly the test data was passed from the android app to the neural network with the python api as the interface between.</li>\n<li>Technologies used: Android, python, Flask, Machine Learning, oct2py, Neural networks, Amazon web services.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Being a diverse team and pretty new to the technologies used in the project, the initial part of the effort was loaded with challenges. We faced challenges like creating new training sets to train the algorithm, setting up the dependencies of the project on AWS, using octave with python, etc.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made an application which not only helped us to enhance our technical skills, but also helps society to diagnose parkinson's disease. Since there aren\u2019t many commonly available tools to detect this disease, this tool can be used world wide.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Using octave with python to integrate a machine learning algorithm in a web application.</li>\n<li>Building our own machine learning REST apis.</li>\n<li>Using cell phone\u2019s accelerometer to detect tremors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Parkinson's Diagnostic Tool</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, there are numerous ways to diagnose Parkinson's disease. Our next steps are to make our tool as versatile as possible and to use multiple tests to help with diagnosis. The following are some things that we want to add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>adding multi level classification with results such as: positive for parkinson\u2019s disease, negative for parkinson\u2019s disease, and parkinson\u2019s under control (while medicated) </li>\n<li>using video recordings of walking posture to diagnose Parkinson's disease (Microsoft has some really great video analytics APIs)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/accelerometer\">accelerometer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">octave</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neural-networks</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ParkinsonsDiagnosticTool\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ParkinsonsDiagnosticTool\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ParkinsonsDiagnosticTool/client\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ParkinsonsDiagnosticTool/client\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ParkinsonsDiagnosticTool/server\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ParkinsonsDiagnosticTool/server\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android application that interacted with out RESTful backend.

We thought about how we could use the technology of today to better the lives of those living with alzheimers. It is very difficult for patients in the early stages of Alzheimers who live alone to keep track of what medications they need take along with doctors visits on a daily basis. While there are many tools such as smartphones that most of us use to keep track of such things, it can be near impossible for early stage patients to use such devices effectively everyday. The best way for them to easily get such information is through a voice communication system.</h2>\n<h2>Using the Amazon echo we can take user input and keep track of recurring medication and their doses, as well tracking when and where doctor's appointments are. We also have the power to remind users about taking medicine, and upcoming appointments. We added the functionality that if the user refuses to take medication we contact an emergency contact and alert them.</h2>\n<h2>Using Amazon's aws server, we were able to pull from the Amazon echo API and communicate with echo and based on time or user input had the device respond to certain actions and situations accordingly.</h2>\n<h2>At first we thought of using a pebble watch because it was cheap and was very portable which is important for the elderly especially. We found however that the interface for the pebble was way too small for them to read or use, and it also didn't have voice capabilities, which was a critical part of our design as it allows easier use for seniors. After choosing Echo we had trouble getting access to the Amazon API for Echo because it costs money. We found a way later using aws to get around that.</h2>\n<h2>The integration of Amazon skill set because this our first Hackathon and we spent a lot of time researching how to use the skill set. So it was satisfying when we got it to work.</h2>\n<h2>We had to learn JavaScript on the fly for aws but thankfully it was very similar to regular Java. We also learned the ins and outs of Amazon skill set.</h2>\n<h2>The ideal system in the future can run on a smartwatch like device that is always with the patient and can give them necessary reminders wherever they are. Such a device would be stand alone and include sound and vibration.

She, like many others, is appalled at how inefficient and clunky these systems are. We care to innovate in many areas of healthcare, yet the record keeping software doctors use to care for their patients manages to be the least innovative solution yet. Simple tasks such as waiting for lab results require several sessions of clicking repeatedly through cluttered screens to get to pertinent information. All of this time wasted leaves patients feeling uncared for and medical staff feeling rushed and unproductive. We can do better.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Doc Alert takes updates from EHRs such as Epic through services like Redox to notify those who are involved in patient care of important test results in real time. Get notifications as lab results are returned. Check values of interest and radiology results without having to navigate through the gigantic mess of a health record system.</p>\n<p>A user can sign up for notifications, verify their access, get notified about results in real time with no PII shown on the alert, access newest records with pertinent information, and asses values easily while on the go.</p>\n<p>The software gets result events from Redox's API, processes the patient result data, pushes notifications out to subscribed users on mobile and in browser, and allows the results to be viewed in an easily digestible format.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>OpenSignal for push notifications on mobile and in browser</p>\n<p>Material Design Lite for the UI</p>\n<p>OpenSignal for push notifications on mobile and in browser</p>\n<p>Redox's API for interacting with EHRs (<a href=\"https://www.redoxengine.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.redoxengine.com/</a>)</p>\n<p>Node/Express for handling data and communicating with Redox and OpenSignal APIs</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Interfacing with Redox's API</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team has a diverse background of software engineers, medical students, and art students.

visualizations.</p>\n<h2><strong>Inspiration</strong></h2>\n<p>The current exchange of health information between emergency medical services (EMS) and hospitals is difficult. In several surveys (EMSA 2013), agencies indicated that the they do not receive timely patient outcomes and discharge data as needed. Moreover, patients and their loved ones themselves are not hastily informed about their conditions, possible treatments, and affected bodily regions. We knew there was much progress to be made in both areas and chose to tackle improving the data visualization aspects. </p>\n<h2><strong>What it accomplishes</strong></h2>\n<p>Our project utilizes BodyParts3D \u00a9, an open source 3D model of the human anatomy which includes the skeletal, muscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, and lymphatic systems. With this model, any patient is able to visualize the localized damage of their conditions and/or injuries. Moreover, we condensed, via tables and graphs, hospital records, prior medical records, and treatments to provide the patient with easily comprehensible information. </p>\n<h2><strong>How we developed it</strong></h2>\n<p>We used Blender to decimate the meshes of the model, allowing us to create significantly lower resolution meshes for convenient use on the internet. Then, we used HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and WebGL/AngularJS/JavaScript to deliver a rich, interactive experience with the model in regards to the patient's conditions. Based on a doctor's notes, distinct anatomical regions in the model could be selected and focused on to further educate the patients and their loved ones on their conditions.</p>\n<h2><strong>What we're excited about</strong></h2>\n<p>We are ecstatic about how interactive the medical report ended up becoming. Data visualization via graphs and tables can only go so far to provide the viewer with information. We are very proud to have developed an instructional and responsive report. Not only will web-delivered medical reports make understanding health easier, but it will ensure ease of access and no need to memorize past afflictions.</p>\n<h2><strong>The future</strong></h2>\n<p>We believe that the field of interactive data visualization holds many promises and we look forward to see how easily information can be presented. We greatly appreciate your viewership of our project and hope that our work was inspirational. </p>\n<h2>Running the report visualizer locally</h2>\n<p>Simply start a local webserver in the repository's root directory, and navigate to <a href=\"http://localhost:%7BPORT%7D/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://localhost:{PORT}/index.html</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/J0Nreynolds/MedicalReportVisualization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/J0Nreynolds/MedicalReportVisualization\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked primarily with WebGL and interacting with the 3D model of the human.

If children become more aware of what foods were healthy and unhealthy, they will be able to make better decisions and choices in cafeterias and restaurants. The foods we chose are most similar to those served at schools around the country.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This app is a game where the player has to chose the healthier food out of the two common foods on the screen. There will be two options available in the form of a picture and name, and then the player must pick the one he or she believes is healthier. Each round tallies up points and games are 10 rounds long. Along with this, there are nutrition labels and food descriptions for each food available to read next to the food on either side. Besides helping them pick the healthier option, it also brings light to the different ingredients, components and benefits of foods. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built the application using Android Studio using Java and XML. We were able to scrape pictures and nutritional information of our common foods from the web. From building this app, we were able to gain exposure into mobile development.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>It was hard to decide how simple or complex to keep the foods. This is a health app, so we want to target children with problems they face in their own health. While making the app there was a lot of going back and forth between foods and presentation. Along with this, we had trouble decided the optimal design for the game with all the nutrition components. For us, it was our first time at such an event and we are amateur coders, so to create a creative project which we could code was difficult. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are really proud of the purpose our app serves. If children are exposed to this game, they can become more and more aware of their options, and it will show them the power they have to make healthy decisions. Besides that, it looks good and works well which is a great accomplishment for us.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>Most of us had never coded using Android Studio, so we spent a lot of time learning this new program. Besides this, while researching we got to see many other projects and applications of this software. Along with these points, we learned how to make our own project from start to finish without any guidance.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Health4Kids</h2>\n<p>Well, this app is just the beginning but educating children of the foods they eat is very essential. In the future we can see children becoming more and more aware as they gain exposure to nutrition labels and ingredients. Eventually, we hope for a healthier America and better foods served at schools.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">native-android</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DabeLong/Health4Kids\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/DabeLong/Health4Kids\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Machine-Learning Specialist.", "", ""]], ["medBuddy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TPnlNkHR4lk?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"medBuddy \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/437/374/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>poster</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"medBuddy \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/435/914/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Iteraction model with the human.

So we had to engineer our own solution to this problem. We used a Rasberry Pi, which talks to Alexa to activate it. This made the project much more complex then expected.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We got the first basic interaction (MVP)** with the user for our idea and created a device which tackles a serious problem of elderly people.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We figured out how to use the Alexa environment and learned about the (current) limitations.</p>\n<h2>What's next for medBuddy</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Implementing the full interaction model according to the graphics shown above (<a href=\"https://mm.tt/788656279?t=YamGYOSoPg\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>).</li>\n<li>Extensive testing to ensure the reliability of the system.</li>\n<li>Once Amazon introduced the time-triggered-action (already announced), we can <strong>get rid of the additional Raspberry Pi</strong>, which makes the app cheaper and easy to distribute.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lambda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["mongodb and nodejs, feature planning, raspberry pi setup\n", "", "", ""]], ["HaltNotify", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We got this idea from personal need</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Its meant to take your gps signal and use androids do not disturb function to another level </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were not able to get the gps info to halt your notifications</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>the gps functionality works fine but we were not able to get the app to use that gps info to out benefit</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for HaltNotify</h2>\n<p>To finish it :D</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gps\">gps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Matanatr96/Ahack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Matanatr96/Ahack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]]]
