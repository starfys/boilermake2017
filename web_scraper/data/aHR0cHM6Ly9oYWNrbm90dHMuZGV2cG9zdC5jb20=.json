We first had ideas of sci-fi inspired UI systems navigated with the Leapmotion, but as we had support for the Braintree api, the idea quickly evolved into a digital Storefront in VR, navigated with the Leapmotion</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It shows a list 3D models of products that the user can scroll through, to then further inspect in the VR space. It lets the user manipulate the model through gestures, and buy the product right from within the VR app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The project uses Unity for the VR application, and a Heroku server to handle the interfacing with Braintree. In the Unity app, there are a few scripts which first filter down the Leapmotion gestures to the ones we are interested in, which are then passed on to the main product display to handle manipulation of the 3D objects. The code in Unity and all the Assets were done by me. The Braintree interaction and signup, as well as the interfacing between the Unity app and Braintree, was done with a Heroku server which would take web requests sent from Unity and handle the correct Api requrests to Braintree. This part was done by Marti.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The main problem under our time constraints was that Leapmotion gestures are fairly unreliable and not as intuitive as one might like them to be. While we were able to make the gestures work fine with a bit of practise, they are still hard to instantly pick up when using the app the first time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Making this project in the 24 hours we had during the Hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Oculus and Leapmotion have a lot of potential, but you have to invest time to get everything out of them.</p>\n<h2>What's next for VR Storefront</h2>\n<p>As this was a quick Hackathon project, the project's current state will likely be its finished state.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree\">braintree</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KeyMaster-/VR-Storefront\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/KeyMaster-/VR-Storefront\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I coded the Unity parts and created all the Assets."]], ["The Marauder's App", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Marauder's App \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/327/915/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Map of the lab showing availability and where your friends are</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Marauder's App \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/327/913/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Marauder's App \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/327/914/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Adding friends</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My daily \"Where are people working\" facebook message spam</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The back end crawls the lab computers, interrogating them using who and finger, then collects the data in Redis.\nThe front end allows students to see where machines are free, and where users they're friends with are working. </p>\n<p>People to pay to reserve a computer, marking it as 'Unavailable' on the map.

I also like the news. Thus, I built sheriff: a web-crawler which extracts stories from news-sites.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sheriff can crawl news-sites in two ways: either by starting at the home-page and detecting news stories, or by crawling the RSS feeds of news-providers. During scraping the title, date published, story content, and--where available--the author name are extracted. </p>\n<p>Using the story-text we summarize the story into up to five main points. Additionally, we generate keywords based on the text with which we tag the story. </p>\n<p>Finally, there's  a prototype web-app that presents scraped stories.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>RSS scraper: self-built</li>\n<li>Generalized web-scraper: scrapy</li>\n<li>Database management: mongodb</li>\n<li>Web-app: flask</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Scraping in a generalized fashion is hard. There is not standard for storing critical information: for instance, date published may be stored in the content of a meta-tag, it may be a string a class, or whatever the developers. There is no consistency, so you need to consider all the possible variations and detect them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm pretty please that I was able to cover as much ground as I did in a handful of hours, despite not having experience in many of the frameworks used. It's in a really rough, incomplete format; However, it gets the idea across while giving me a base to further expand off-of.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>Programmatic Learning</h2>\n<p>I did a mongoDB tutorial pre-hack, but beyond that I had not experience in noSQL based databases. Alongside that, while I've worked on html-scraping, I wasn't farmiliar with scrapy. </p>\n<h2>Time-management</h2>\n<p>While I'm pleased with the amount I did, I should have managed my time better. I sunk too much time working on a generalized parser, when I should've focused on RSS feeds.

Just using any web browser, the players can access together the same match and compete one against each other. There are two different game modes, the first one tests the memory and the second one the reflex.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>At the beginning we discussed together the idea of the project. Then we realised that the most efficient way to build it was Node.js as back-end and HTML, CSS3 and JavaScript as front-end.\nWe started by creating the website and dividing into 2 sub-groups in which the first one was involved into designing the web pages and the second one took care about the backend server part.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Dividing and assigning each task to a member of the group in order to complete the project in the possible fastest way.\nConnection and iteration among smartphones, computers and servers. \nFinding a really fun idea for an impressive gameplay and design of the game.\nLearning Node.js and Javascript.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We created a game that works great with many users connected and playing at the same time with each other.\nI am proud of being a part of this incredible team and learning from each other.\nWe were able to communicate and understand our goals and to collaborate in order to reach them.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt how to create a web server based on Node.js, that also implements a Json API and how to interact with other devices through AJAX.</p>\n<p>We improved our work-team skills through planning each step and split the tasks based on the knowledge of every member. Every time we set a goal and when we achieved it we moved to the next one.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Nottic</h2>\n<p>We would like to make more games and challenges that permit the players to also bet their money in a very simple way using Braintree.
