Even worse, areas of our building have a poor wireless signal overall regardless of the areas devices. We've spent a great number of hours roaming our hall with laptops and phones, staring at ugly text based tables searching for devices and checking signal strength. We wanted to deploy devices that could do the job we coulden't; to monitor the hall and its networks (or any area for that matter) 24/7 and look through the data at our leisure.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>WiZer (Pronounced Wiser) works by connecting to microcontroller based devices such as the Intel Edison and Rasberry Pi that run a custom python application. The application reports the wireless networks and a multitude of information about them to a central machine running a WiZer instance. In our case, we deployed our instance to IBM Bluemix. WiZer then cleans up the information and stores it in MongoDB, keeping it at the ready for searching and future analyzation. WiZer features a beautiful web based client that allows for easy network searching, rouge device detection, network monitoring, wireless channel analysis and wireless history storage; all with the luxury of never leaving your desk.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The library we intended to use to capture wireless network information was broken on all systems we tested. We had to reimplement the package from the ground up.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even with the major delay presented by the broken Python package, we were still able to have our Node instance receive wireless data in a JSON format before midnight.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We both learned how to configure and flash an Edison as well as the fine art of messy string splicing to form beautiful JSON. We also learned how to use AngularJS filters to sort data in a more efficient manner. Furthermore, James learned how to work with Mongo.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WiZer</h2>\n<p>We'd like to start by reworking the backend and cleaning up some of the egregiously messy string splits to produce more reliable data. We'd also like to create a more dynamic link between the microcontrollers and the WiZer instance with support for controller (We call them node's) statuses and logs. We'd also love to finish implementing some of our larger ideas for analysis like wireless device triangulation and available bandwidth calculation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cwheel/WiZer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cwheel/WiZer\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://wizer.mybluemix.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wizer.mybluemix.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>wizer.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["SynthCOW", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cB2DcgQfHMs?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SynthCOW \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/798/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SynthCOW \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/799/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SynthCOW \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/797/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SynthCOW \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/796/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SynthCOW \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/795/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration:</h2>\n<p>Distraught by the lack of recent innovation in the theremin industry, the SynthCOW team set out to create the most radical musical interface possible, breaking down the analog walls that have been constraining theremin enthusiasts for decades.</p>\n<h2>How it works:</h2>\n<p>Left distance controls pitch, right distance controls volume.

The glove was going to be able to give feedback by using servos and wires to stop the hand from closing. Because we weren't familiar with developing through the Oculus Rift, we ventured to find other uses for this technology. We took a health approach after we realized that the glove could be used to help people who suffer from arthritis. We modified our original idea so that instead of  stopping the user from closing their hand, it records data about the movement of each finger.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The PowerGlove works by using flex sensors to measure the deflection of each finger. The data gets wirelessly transmitted to a computer which will analyze the raw data, filter through the invalid measurements, and store the data on a database. \nA common method physicians and doctors recommend for patients with arthritis do deal with their pain is simple hand and finger exercises. We have created a web app that walks through these exercises with the patient and records if the user can complete them. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some challenges we ran into were figuring out how to communicate between the glove and the web server; finding how to wire the glove so that each movement could intrusively be measured with maximum accuracy.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about arthritis and the research going on being the condition; how to read from a serial port, parse the data, and write to a MySql database; and advanced soldering techniques. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud-sql\">google-cloud-sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">toro</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/net\">.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/less\">less</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">libserial</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://powerglove.cntr.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://powerglove.cntr.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>powerglove.cntr.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Implemented backend resources and data structures as well as handling client-server API integration between the hardware and web app.", "Worked on the mechanical and electrical systems on the Power glove and set up the communication between it and the computer that handled data processing.

When asked why she didn't call the police immediately, the women said she was scared if the phone made noise or if she talked too loud the intruder would hear and find them. </p>\n<p>This story was very unsettling, and after some research I found it wasn't a rare occurrence either. There are over 3 million home invasions and burglaries in the US every year, and nearly half of those invaders are lethally armed. These victims who were killed by invaders were people: they had lives, families, friends, and they should have had futures too. My goal was to find a way to stop these lethal situations from happening, and to save the lives of future victims.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>RoboCop allows a person to silently and quickly call emergency services without the need to speak or spend time dialing and then explaining the situation. Within seconds of opening the app the police are called and given your GPS coordinates. Any additional information you give the service, such as exact location in the building or your current situation, will be translated from text to speech using IBM's Watson and sent to the police station using IBM Bluemix and Twilio.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Both the accuracy of location and sending out the call quickly were important to get emergency services to the user as rapidly as possible. Seconds can make the difference between life and death in some cases, and we had to ensure we could balance these two components to minimize response time. By allowing the app to send new information as it became available, rather than all at one time, we were able to allow near instant calling when the app is opened.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of &amp; What I learned</h2>\n<p>Because almost every emergency service call center in the US cannot receive text or non-audio information and home invasions are a real danger, we are proud that our app has the potential to save lives that might have otherwise been lost. I have never worked on an app before, and have mostly just worked in data science. Many of the components and steps in this project were completely new to me, but I didn't give up!</p>\n<h2>What's next for RoboCop</h2>\n<p>Using a custom phone launcher, we hope to be able to add a \"stealth call\" feature that calls the police based off of a button click combination (ex.- power button clicked and then volume-up button clicked four times) so the service can be used without the use of a screen and while still in a person's pocket. This might be useful to those in situations where they need to call the police but cannot due to a person watching them such as during a mugging or a physically abusive relationship.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-phone\">windows-phone</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phonegap\">phonegap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">smartphone</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Frontend, UX, presentation, etc..", "Backend, API-integration, frontend, UX"]], ["djQ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A way to request music at parties easily.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Every \"Dj\" has their own page that streams YouTube videos.

I sat with some people from my division and they mentioned how past interns would be measuring the skittle jar and solving how many skittles there were using packing fractions (I just guessed). Not wanting to be outdone by past interns, I told them that next year I will have built an app that would calculate how many skittles there were using just an input picture. HackUMass seemed like the perfect opportunity to make right on this promise.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Using a picture taken from your phone, this program estimates the number of units (in our case, skittles), in a volume. This will ensure that with any raffle you enter that has this criteria, the end goal is an estimate of contents within a certain tolerance. Using OPENCV, we've created two separate methods to estimate the volume. The first of these utilizes bitmasking color boundaries on a container with aid from user preprocessed images to estimate volume and computing a Riemann's sum vertically with respect to x, called \"Poor Man's Computer Vision.\" The second utilizes OPENCV's native computer image capabilities to a greater extent, by blurring the image using a Gaussian matrix, and using a canny edge detection method to outline the filled volume. The scale(pixel/cm) is calculated by using Hough Circles of the most perfect skittle in the glass and returning that circle's radius. The volume is computed the same as our other method.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>-BGR... because OpenCV is too good for RGB\n-color blending issues\n-inexperience (1 Freshman, 1 Neuroscience major with no programming skills)\n-No OpenCV experience\n-picture resolution\n-OpenCV is almost impossible to configure for resizeable windows, 4K resolution isn't enough to show these images.\n-1 mac, 2 linux, and 1 PC consistently caused issues (dependencies, and incompatibilities)\n-Floobits version control (we should have used git, so many overwriting issues.)\n***side note, floobits isn't version control, it's \"Everyone-can-overwrite-an-hour-of-someone-elses-work\" control</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Coming into this event, I was the only programmer on my team of four that had any python experience.  I would say the fact that my team picked the language up so quickly is certainly an accomplishment.  None of us had any experience using computer vision tech coming into this challenge either, and we turned it into the core of our project.

Regular chess rules apply, except when a piece is captured, the capturer gives the piece to their ally, which can then place the piece at any point during their turn on their board. It is a game of strategy, tactics and a lot of chess pieces traveling between the boards.</p>\n<p>Our lead programmer, Richard Cui, did a great job coding almost everything, especially networking and UI:\n<img alt=\"Settlers of Catan\" data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/startMenu.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--6P42j6BF--/https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/startMenu.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"Settlers of Catan\" data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/Client.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--AhxaR8Iw--/https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/Client.png\"/></p>\n<p>Our front-end developer, Diane Tam, designed the most beautiful GUI for chess game:\n<img alt=\"Settlers of Catan\" data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/gameStart.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--OMzetp3I--/https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/gameStart.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"Settlers of Catan\" data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/movePieces.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--uX59HOEs--/https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/movePieces.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"Settlers of Catan\" data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/captureBlack.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--R-OLrU5F--/https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/captureBlack.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"Settlers of Catan\" data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/placeBlack.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--7z1TMkkh--/https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/placeBlack.png\"/>\n<img alt=\"Settlers of Catan\" data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/midGame.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--9OCF6Epn--/https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess/raw/master/pictures/screenshot/midGame.png\"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Rithy58/hackumass-bughouse-chess\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://rithy58.github.io/hackumass-bughouse-chess/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://rithy58.github.io/hackumass-bughouse-chess/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rithy58.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Carpool", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In a lasting tradition that occurs at least twice a semester, the Amherst College Facebook page gets flooded by posts such as \"Hey I'm going to Bradley airport on mm/dd/yyyy.  Does anyone else need to go as well?\" or \"Is it possible for me to carpool with someone back to Amherst on mm/dd/yyyy from Boston?\"  This process was repeated over and over again until eventually everyone found (or didn't find) means of transportation to where they needed to go.  After having to go through the extremely process of messaging all of our friends, all of our friends' friends, and all of our friends' friends' parents we decided that enough was enough.  We decided to make an app that would easily allow us to arrange for transportation to wherever we needed to go for a fraction of the price and effort.  Taking a course at a different college and looking to carpool with someone?  Post an event with our app.  Have a car and want to save on gas/and or get company?  Post an event with our app.</p>\n<p>But we soon realized that the true potential of this app was not limited to college students avoiding the Peter Pan bus.  Such an app would enable college students to also be able to carpool with local residents that might have cars and spare room.  It could be a means for people that have daily commutes from say Waltham to Boston to be able to organize carpools to work.  We believe that this app has a lot of potential and as a result have decided to begin its implementation here at HackUMass.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>This is an android app that caters to people looking to create or join communal trips.\nThere are two kinds of users: drivers and travelers. Drivers create events by providing info about the trip such as origin, destination, date, time, car type, and seats available. Travelers can search for a trip that fits their needs and once they do, they \"take a seat\" in the car.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Most of the languages used were languages our team members had little to no experience in.\nGit push/pull/merge/stash/clone</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We have never done an app that depends on a database (half of our team had never worked on an app at all) so getting the backend running was a big accomplishment.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to set up a database on a server.

This acts as the home module, and would be located in or near the shower (waterproofed, of course).  This module is running in AP mode, acting as a wireless access point. A UDP server and the Johnny-Five node.js library are running to collect data, and to output information to the LCD screen in your shower.  A serial-to-wifi device (ESP8266) and an I2C temperature sensor are connected to an ST Nucleo MBED board.  This mbed setup is measuring the temperature of the water heater, and sending this data wirelessly via the serial wifi module with UDP to the UDP server on the home module. This in turn does calculations to find how much time of hot water is left based on the varying usage of the hot water, and the result is displayed on the home module LCD screen.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>-Calculating the change in temperature in the water heater.\n-Sending temperature data wirelessly from the shower and hot water heater to each other to display data on the LCD screens.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>-Figuring out how to calculate the rate of change of temperature (in the water heater), and the Time to Cold Water\n-Using a bus pirate to successfully scan the I2C address for the temperature sensors to grab data.\n-Accessing the ESP8266 via serial from the mbed board.\n-Getting the ESP8266 (Serial Wifi module) to connect to the Access Point.\n-Having the ESP8266 send temperature data to the home module.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>-Thermodynamics of water\n-I2C addressing\n-LCD interfacing\n-Learned how to use the Intel Edison, Nucleo MBed platforms.\n-ESP8266 Usage</p>\n<h2>What's next for Water Heater TTC (Time To Cold Water)</h2>\n<p>This is obviously a prototype setup, so we want to make this use more dedicated hardware rather than a lot of unnecessary hardware. The Internet of Things setup is using the home module (Edison) as the network access point, but in the future we would want to have this automatically connect to a home network for easier access.

We determined the best implementation was using organized government information on different medicines. While this was a useful tool, we wanted to expand the app, so we continued to brainstorm. Soon Danny had come up with another idea, a program that could guide you through finals week with an optimized study schedule using some of the latest research on sleep, and ideal studying. We decided that since both of these could be considered health and wellness apps we combined them to provide a great resource for all students.</p>\n<h2>The Design Process</h2>\n<p>We started by designing the basic screens on paper. This evolved into graphics created with the latest version of GIMP(The GNU Image Manipulation Program). The basic designs were then abstracted out into the different elements for which we then wrote implementation code. We continued with this until we reached the more complex algorithmic requirements of the academic section. Danny and I, in collaboration, designed a simple linear time algorithm that provided optimal results for maintaining circadian rhythm while maximizing efficient studying. This was then implemented in the code and debugged. The next hurdle was creating the API calls in the medicine section. This was accomplished using the open documentation on <a href=\"https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://open.fda.gov/drug/event/</a> and <a href=\"http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/RxNormAPIREST.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/RxNormAPIREST.html</a> which were very helpful. Once these were implemented we finished designing the screens, and, with a little touching up, we decided it was ready for beta.It was developed for all major mobile platforms (Android, iOS, Windows).</p>\n<h2>The Testing Process</h2>\n<p>We ran through it with multiple different data sets for both features without major issues, user testing revealed some user interface issues and a few crashes. We then proceeded to debug the issue and find design solutions. This resulted in a slightly more polished and much more stable app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">awk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">objective-c++</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sdl\">sdl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">openfda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rxnav</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ruler501/HackUMass\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ruler501/HackUMass\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote most of the code, and helped design the algorithm.

Instead of having to manage everything yourself, our website allows for a host to create an event, set a start and end date for the event, start and end time for the event, and an estimated duration for the event.  Once the host inputs and submits this information,  a random id is assigned to the inputs, and then placed in our database. From there we generate a new url that the host can send to their guests. The guests than can input the times and days they are available for the event. Once again, we take these forms and input it into another table in our data base, and then return the best dates and times that all the guests can meet for that event. </p>\n<p>We did run into many challenges while creating our project.  We both were using github in order to work on the project. Many times we had merge conflicts where our work was not syncing. Another issue we ran into was when we were working on the algorithm to return the best times and dates for the events. It took us a while before we found the best algorithm.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we had issues with the CSS. We struggled alot to decide on what background to use. After that it take hundreds of tries to make the banner. We than had difficulty making the banner stretch regardless of the browser type. After that we had trouble formatting our forms and submit buttons to the center. Eventually we did figure all these things out and everything works quite smoothly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sparc</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maven\">maven</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/notepad\">notepad++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">server</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">virtual-box</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gimp\">gimp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mspaint\">mspaint</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked primarily on the front end and planning stages.

In the beginning we believed it would be incompatible, however with all the small steps that we take, it reached our goals.</h2>\n<h2>What I learned: We learned how to incorporate motion gestures to keystrokes and mouse movements.

We all have had experiences waiting to get a haircut. Spending two hours twice a month for something that really takes 30 minutes to do is a tremendous waste of time especially in a day in age where we try to fit 60 hours of work into a 40 hour week.</h2>\n<h2>How it works. Prossimo works by the barber having a set schedule and then their clients selecting spots that work for them and the barber's schedules.</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into. Writing out a business plan to figure out how to best fit the needs of both the barber and customer. Two sides to the market as if the customers do not download application, then barbers will not subscribe and vice-versa.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of. Getting this app off the ground. We have been working very hard to get as much as we can into the app and therefore are very excited with what has been done in 36 hours.</h2>\n<h2>What I learned. We have learned how to maximize our strengths and minimize weaknesses. Some of us can code, some of us cannot, some of us prefer presenting, others are better at crafting a pitch, and so on.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Prossimo.
