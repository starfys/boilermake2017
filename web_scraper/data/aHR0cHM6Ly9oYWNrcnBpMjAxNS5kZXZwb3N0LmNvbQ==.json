When a student navigates the internet in class, they are constantly bombarded with content that is often distracting or not acceptable for the classroom.

Unfortunately, I don't remember who voiced that idea, but I'm happy to try and keep it alive.  CheckTheMirror is an Alexa Voice Skill that performs a sentiment analysis on your most recent tweets and lets you know how you're doing--be thee positive as of late or negative.</p>\n<p>So next time you're in a rush, throwing on your tie or combing snarls out of your hair, when you stop to look at yourself in the mirror for that brief but telling moment--that moment where, if but for the only time that day, you're sure that you <em>exist</em>--say aloud, \"Alexa, ask the mirror how I've been lately\" and listen for some insight into your recent Twitter history that you may not have even consciously recognized.</p>\n<h2>Installation/Setup</h2>\n<p>You'll need to set up a Twitter application to give the voice skill access to your tweets.  Once completed, clone the repository and run <code>npm install</code>; this will download and install the <code>twitter</code> and <code>sentiment-analysis</code> dependencies.  Create an AWS Lambda function and Alexa Voice Skill, and fill in the AWS app ID and Twitter keys in <code>index.js</code>.  Zip together <code>index.js</code>, <code>AlexaSkill.js</code>, and <code>node_modules</code> so that all three are in the root of the zip, then upload it as the code to the AWS Lambda function.</p>\n<p>I realize these installation directions are somewhat vague, but this is a project for HackRPI Fall 2015, so I'm not going for any completeness awards.</p>\n<p>And let's face it, art is supposed to be vague, right?

On top of that, we've added the ability to log in and save your code, a feature that was sorely lacking from the existing one. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the open source compiler and placed it into a new website which we created using HTML/SCSS/JS, and edited the compiler and what it outputted to match our new, simplified, and slightly more beginner friendly UI. We then added Microsoft Azure integration to allow a user to login and then save their programs for later once they were done. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Porting the open source compiler over was very frustrating, but we managed to get through it. Styling the elements and creating a visual stack, etc. was also challenging. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We'll be able to put this IDE on the internet, and anyone will be able to use it. We're especially proud that it will likely be used in our school to teach future years of students about 6502 Assembly.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Javascript and Microsoft

It is also highly impractical for the individual to <em>bring</em> mucous samples from outside to their primary physicians \u2013 as the samples degrade rapidly over time.</p>\n<p>By analysing mucous, SnotShot gives a precursory indicator whether one shall visit their healthcare provider or not, and thus <strong>significantly reduces the time and resources wasted</strong> in such cases. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The algorithm is implemented with the help of Open Computer Vision Library in Python, based on a test called \"BronkoTest\". I wondered how I could deploy it as a usable web application, and finally settled on using a Node.js wrapper along with some Jade/Bootstrap for the front-end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I had some difficulty in explaining people why I am trying to work on a topic that is so much looked down upon in the society (<em>\"Eww! That's gross\"</em> \u2013 a participant said). On the technical side, I faced some challenges in trying to get the OpenCV Library up as it comes with a huge list of dependencies.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was successful in building something that would help healthcare professionals deliver better, more insightful care to their patients.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a great deal about how Computer Vision works (using the Open Computer Vision library). I also gained an understanding of K-means clustering \u2013 a simple unsupervised learning algorithm. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SnotShot</h2>\n<p>Improving and porting the algorithm from web app to a mobile app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow-(tried)</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I built it."]], ["Food Circulation Network", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Food Circulation Network \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/323/095/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Recover Rochester is a club at our school that collects and distributes food to reduce food waste in the area. One in six Americans are food insecure, meaning that they do not have the resources to have reliable access to food. As a chapter of the Food Recovery Network, they help collect food that would otherwise go unused and make it accessible to food-insecure individuals. They have a database of what food they have collected and distributed, but no way to easily process that data. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Food Circulation Network is a tool for chapters of the Food Recovery Network to keep track of the food they have collected and distributed.

Activity Buddy uses data from Microsoft Band to detect your running pace and intensity as well as your schedule in order to find someone who can comfortably run alongside you.</p>\n<p>Activity Buddy records distance traveled, time taken, and calories burned during your running routine. It uses this information to infer when and how hard you run and records this in a central database. Then users can use the app to find people with similar routines to them and get them in contact with each other so that they can start exercising together!</p>\n<h2>How is it Built?</h2>\n<p>The Android app was made using the Java Android library, <a href=\"http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Butterknife</a>, and Microsoft's <a href=\"https://developer.microsoftband.com/bandSDK\" rel=\"nofollow\">Android Band SDK</a>.

However, we also noticed that in the era of minifying JavaScript, CSS and even HTML, the heavy bandwidth offenders, images, seemed essentially left out. We realized that to have a truly snappy page (and one without blurry, mis-proportioned images), something needed to be built.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Imccelerate intercepts all GET requests and inspects them for known image types. If imccelerate detects a request for an image, it will then scale the image appropriately based on the users screen size and screen density. Then, the resulting image is dropped into an LRU cache to let others with the same screen resolution enjoy a massive speed boost in page loading, up to 90% faster with 90% less bandwidth in some of our tests. Furthermore, imccelerate features a proper image sizing system. Why request a massive, 3x page filling image if its just for a thumbnail? We took a cue from Bootstrap and added a variety of sizes ranging from extra small to extra large. These sizes can seamlessly be appended to each image request. Even better, some of our sizes (including a custom profile image size) feature vision logic from Microsoft Oxford. Finally, we attempted to solve one last issue. What happens if a site comes under heavy load and still needs to deliver lots of content? To attempt to solve this, we built a dynamic CDN offloading system. If an image resource becomes too heavily requested to continue its successful delivery, imccelerate will offload the image to Azures high powered content delivery network and seamlessly move clients to it, all without any interruption in service.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Express middleware model to intercept and filter GET requests. Once we were sure we had an image, we used Graphicsmagick to process the image and send it for further processing with Oxford if needed. Once we had our image in the form of a buffer, we dropped it (along with a few other pieces of statistical information) into a least recently used cache. The cache takes care of dropping resources that are infrequently queried, while keeping those that are fresh. We then send out the processed image to any future clients with the same resolution and device display density.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Configuring the live offload CDN was particularly difficult as the documentation pertinent to storage services with Node was a bit lacking.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We\u2019re proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to built something that reduces the required image bandwidth up to 90%. 90%! That's incredible! Using this technology a site could go from slow and blurry to speedy and sharp in a matter of minutes. Furthermore, imccelerate could enable easier development, as all image sizes originate from one resource. No need to design 15 images for 300 different screens.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a ton about Azure, network performance monitoring and Express middleware. Also learned how to use GraphicsMagick, an awesome image manipulation library.</p>\n<h2>What's next for imccelerate</h2>\n<p>We'd like to make imccelerate more stable and efficient in the future, as well as to incorporate a dynamic quality algorithm to save just a bit more bandwidth. At some point, we'd like to be able to achieve a 95% reduction in bandwidth over our raw images.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-project-oxford\">microsoft-project-oxford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">graphicsmagick</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cwheel/imccelerate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cwheel/imccelerate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["GolfVR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GolfVR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/576/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GolfVR \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/565/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GolfVR \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/564/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We had minimal hardware and wanted to be creative with it!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>GolfVR is a VR simulation of golf where the player uses a selfie stick and a iPhone as a club to hit the virtual golf ball!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it with the iPhone accelerometer which was sent to a Node.js websocket server which communicated with the Unity client.

Targeting college campuses, Unknown To acts as a personal concierge, filling you in on quirks as well as ins and outs of the campus. Additionally, it assists you in locating the nearest bathroom, water fountain, meeting place, or vending machine.</p>\n<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n<p>As students new to a college campus, we were, and still are eager to discover the small, quirky things that set our campus apart from others. Of course any given tour guide can spit out a list of scripted facts, but we want to hear it from the students themselves.</p>\n<h1>Why</h1>\n<p>Unknown To Me allows for a faster assimilation into campus culture, making the transition from high school to college much smoother. For prospective students, this introduces a more in depth glimpse of what the college they are looking at has to offer. For current students or visitors, this provides a fun tour of student approved quirks. Not only does this help with your exploration of campus by providing you with a list of liked places, but it's also convenient, especially when you're looking for a bathroom or water fountain.</p>\n<h1>Features</h1>\n<p>Unknown to me will calculate the shortest straight line distance to your desired destination. Furthermore, it will provide a brief description of your destination, for quirks this mean what's unique and for bathrooms this consists of how many stalls there are or how clean it is.</p>\n<h1>What's Next for Unknown To Me?</h1>\n<p>We hope that Unknown To Me will expand to more college campuses and even become an add-on for existing map applications such as Google Maps or Waze. We want to increase the number of existing locations by allowing users to add places, contributing to content generation. The quality of any location will be determined by user reviews. However, to prevent users from hating on any given location without reason, we will impose a minimum number of words for the review, forcing the reviewer to give reasons for his/her opinion.</p>\n<p>So far this idea is only 24 hours old, so we'll see where it goes...</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/slack\">slack</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://unknownto.me/necessitiesunknownto.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://unknownto.me/necessitiesunknownto.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>unknownto.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LucienBrule/unknowntome\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LucienBrule/unknowntome\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend, devops, web rest api, and pitched the technology side of the app.", "", ""]], ["Intelligent ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>example</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["MusicShare", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MusicShare \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/323/058/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1><a href=\"http://musicshare.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MusicShare.Me</a></h1>\n<h4>What is MusicShare?

We were very excited about using this technology, and after discussing some ideas with the Microsoft team we began implementing it to collect data on popular movie trailers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Comma is a web application that can determine the emotions shown in a video, such as a trailer for a movie, allowing for movies to be ranked based on their emotions. This allows for further analysis, where videos can be ranked and categorized based on the emotions expressed in the trailer.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used OpenCV to process the videos into frames. We then dropped half of the frames to reduce the calls needed. To further reduce the amount of calls needed we used OpenCV to stitch frames into a 2 x 5 array to batch them into one request. We then submitted this batched request to Microsoft's Project Oxford Emotion's API which gave us the confidence index of each face. We then took all the faces that it found and averaged these values together to get the average emotions in the video.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Project Oxford only allows 10,000 requests per month, with a limit of 20 requests per minute, which would normally be a problem if we made a single request for each frame in the trailer. With each trailer consisting of upwards of 4,000 frames, this would quickly run through our API limits and prevent other movies from being analyzed. In order to get around this issue, we processed a limited selection of frames and made batch requests, allowing us to reduce the number of requests made by 40x.</p>\n<p>The API returns a neutral rating a vast majority of the time. We believe that this is partially due to the api having a preference for rating neutral as well as the fact that most of the time we have more neutral faces rather than exagerated emotions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>In a short amount of time our team was able to utilize an new API to get biometric data, create a database to store the data, and design a webpage to demonstrate the technology. Everyone from our team is leaving having learned something new.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team varied in software and Hackathon experience. Some of the technologies that were new to the team included NumPy, OpenCV, Git, Flask, and SQLite. No one on the team had prior experience using the Emotions API and we enjoyed using this unique technology to create tangible data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-project-oxford\">microsoft-project-oxford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tredzko/Comma\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tredzko/Comma\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://comma-hackrpi.cloudapp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://comma-hackrpi.cloudapp.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>comma-hackrpi.cloudapp.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on hooking up the database to the front-end templates, so data could be retrieved and displayed to the users.

All of the group members watched the famous Twitch stream of all of The Joy of Painting. In commemoration to Bob Ross, we made a game focused on themes in the show.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a top-down-arcade-style game. Evil enemies (trees and clouds) come to harm Bob Ross, the main character. Bob Ross has to fight off these foes. He starts with his Chisel Tool, but after every wave, he may upgrade his arsenal. Waves get progressively harder as the game progresses.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built this project in Java, using the Slick2D game engine.

The Soundcloud API enabled us to dynamically acquire music without needing to store any audio on our local server. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The WebAudio API is extremely new with minimal widespread use and documentation. Audio analysis itself is incredibly challenging and one of the major endeavors in modern computer science research. Therefore we needed to try a more simple approach. The Soundcloud API also presented challenges as there is a yet unfixed bug in their API that creates an extra challenge for us. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The entire project was beyond our comfort zone. Using Canvas to this extent an animating so many different, layered components, and keeping track of the collisions and monitoring for different conditions was brutal. Ultimately worth it. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 Canvas, WebAudio API, Soundcloud API</p>\n<h2>What's next for SoundScape</h2>\n<p>More game mechanics, better animations and graphics!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/canvas\">canvas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the HTML5 Canvas animations and game mechanics - I also did the audio analysis and procedural generation of obstacles.

It then uses this information to generate a relevant playlist to complement the setting of the room. For example, rooms with happier people will also get happier music, and rooms of angry people will get angry-sounding music. The music will also vary by the number of people in the room; rooms with more people in it will get more instrumental music and less lyrics, so as to not disturb a conversation. Rooms with a lot of people will receive more dance music, as a way to detect and appropriately entertain a party.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The images are recieved by a Kinect. Chaplin uses the image and skeleton API to get pictures of peoples' faces and count when people enter the scene and how many. The people's emotions are determined by using Microsoft Project Oxford's Emotion API. After using some heuristics, it uses the Echonest API to make correlations between the people in the room and the music they should get. Echonest is searched by factors such as valence, danceability, and speechiness. The song are then located on spotify's library and streamed to a Bose SoundTouch speaker.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-project-oxford\">microsoft-project-oxford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bose-soundtouch\">bose-soundtouch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spotify\">spotify</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/echo-nest\">echo-nest</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/deezer\">deezer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chickenbellyfinn/chaplin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chickenbellyfinn/chaplin\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["i made it"]], ["postur", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>postur</h1>\n<p>Basically, we were thinking because RPI uses a lot of poster.

When having to choose the best software, many go with well-known suites such as Microsoft Office, Google Docs, or Scrivener. Google Docs is free, but it's mostly online. You'll have to work offline in places with no Internet connectivity and hope that you don't accidentally exit the tab. Microsoft Office isn't free, and is linear in nature, just like Google Docs. You write page to page, from start to finish. However, stories don't work that way. You may have a simple scene in mind, or a character profile you'd like to develop - maybe just a quick idea or two. Perhaps you have a chapter that belongs later in the story. While you can try to move multiple documents into various folders, it usually ends up as a mess and a hassle to organize. Scrivener is amazing in how it lets you develop stories, but is commercial software. Younger writers can't afford to buy expensive specialized software and new writers don't have much reason to either. It's also sometimes overwhelming for first-time writers to get used to the interface and overall functionality of the suite.</p>\n<p>I developed StoryHub so that younger writers can easily adjust to starting their first story. You shouldn't be discouraged from writing because the software is too expensive or overwhelming. StoryHub will be free (open-source) to use and will continue to improve to suit the needs of writers. However, it shouldn't be limited to just stories. You can use it to take notes in class or manage other types of texts beyond stories. StoryHub's primary objective may be to assist writers in crafting stories, but its capabilities go far beyond that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>StoryHub enables the user to write their stories within the desktop application and back them up to GitHub. It organizes the author's stories for them, so they don't have to. Authors can focus on their stories alone and leave the rest to StoryHub. Since HackRPI is a 24-hour hackathon, StoryHub focuses on GitHub alone as a solution. I want to expand beyond GitHub so that writers can save their work in various online options (or download it directly in a compressed format). I also want to create a separate, simple layout that can be switched to for younger writers to easily use.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Electron, which lets you build cross-platform desktop applications with web technologies. It's made by GitHub and is an amazing means of translating what would otherwise be web application work to multiple devices. I used npm to manage all of the necessary packages to build StoryHub and the rest of the application is no different than a web application (i.e. it uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The GitHub API was difficult to work with at first due to some authentication issues, but afterwards, it's just writing functions for the types of requests you need to make. They get more complex as you attempt to move more data around simultaneously. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was able to build a desktop application that works and looks like any other package on my laptop (running Linux).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Package distribution can be tough. You need to ensure all of the strict requirements for the OS are upheld for the package you're releasing. There's also tons of limits for how much you can request from a service such as GitHub. In cases where those limits are reached, there needs to be a way to temporarily go around to other services as a backup, while remaining in sync.</p>\n<p>I love Electron - the overall concept is really cool. You can take something off the web and put it right on your desktop. You no longer need to go to \"somedomain.com\" to get things done. Everything runs off your computer, yet behaves as if you were on a web application. It's easy to release on multiple platforms as well - with one line in the terminal, you have the program file for Windows, OSX, and Linux.</p>\n<h2>What's next for StoryHub</h2>\n<p>Work with NaNoWriMo.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to promote the desktop application when it is more mature in the development process to NaNoWriMo and its participants. It'll be a great way of getting feedback from writers of all backgrounds and experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Move away from just GitHub.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to add Google Drive, Dropbox, direct download capability, and so on. These online services are just a means to backup your precious work. Not all writers have technical background, so it should be as simple as possible to write and save without leaving the desktop application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Redesign the interface. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had less than 24 hours to work on StoryHub, and it should definitely be more immersive. It's the kind of application that should be run in full screen mode and not look just like a bunch of forms.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Add in safety measures.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Examples include saving your work upon any exit from the application (whether it was intentional or not).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alanplotko/StoryHub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alanplotko/StoryHub\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Tact", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>You're at a funeral, when your Shakira ringtone starts blasting from your phone.

There is no known cure for ALS and only one FDA-approved drug, riluzole, which may only add a year to a patient\u2019s life span. Because of this disease, patients are not able to perform basic necessities in their life. We wanted to build a tool for ALS patients and for those who cannot perform physical activities, that can understand their emotions and empower them to communicate with the world.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p> provides a tool for ALS patients to perform basic interactions. It uses Muse headband and alphacore board style web app to understand the patient's emotions and gestures using the EEG signals generated in their brain. Interactions that can be performed with the app includes chatting, asking basic question (like what time or date is), or calling their caretaker. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Muse to capture movement of the specific set of muscles. For now, we are focusing on eye blinks and jaw clenches to store response from patients. We are expecting that the patient can control at least one of the two muscles. We also built an alphacore board as a web app that be controlled by the patients using their gestures and emotions. The communication between patients and the rest of the world is done using Twilio API.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">health</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/avinav/GamePlayUsingBrainSignals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/avinav/GamePlayUsingBrainSignals\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked with muse sdk and twilio api to get the data and sending text messages", "", "", "", ""]]]
