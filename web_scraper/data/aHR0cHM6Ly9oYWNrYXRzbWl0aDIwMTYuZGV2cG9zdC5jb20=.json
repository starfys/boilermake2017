This is my first time writing something serious in Clojure (the lisp-like language that is commonly used for genetic programming), so I am very proud of what I have accomplished during this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The program takes in 10 test cases input/output of any function. So, for example, if you want x^2, the cases could be 1-1, 2-4, 5-25, 6-36, 10-100, etc. In order to make testing easier, I generate the 10 test cases programmatically. The program starts by generating random programs based on defined grammar. My grammar involves just numbers from 1 to 10, and operators plus, minus, divide and multiply. There is also support for increment/decrement a number by x, x being the parameter. Then, these random programs are tested based on the earlier generated test cases. Of course, since programs are random, most of them will perform terribly. But some will still perform better than others, perhaps passing one or two test cases. We take those better-performing programs, and use them as parents, to evolve next generations of the program, using mutation and crossover (this terminology comes from real-life genetic processes, and the concept is the same). Eventually, after a few generations (could be a lot of generations), the program evolves itself into the right formula. It may look differently from what we are used to, because of how the formula was generated, but it will work. For example, instead of x^2+1, it might say x*x*x/x + x/x, or similar. Again, because of a lot of randomization in the evolution of the program, every time you run my program, you might get a different-looking formula, which will, however, simplify to the same thing. I find that fascinating.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I am using a fungp library that I found online to do the backbone of the evolution, such as crossover and mutation. I specify the test cases, and parameters of the evolution, many of which are functions themselves. There are a lot of different ways to do evolutionary programming, and the library is flexible with which methods I want to use, which also means I need to program in my method, and then input it as a parameter into the library. For example, in order to select the best-fitting programs to be the parents, I am using what is called \"tournament selection\". That essentially means running several tournaments among randomly chosen programs, and making the best of them parents. I choose the best ones based on exactly how far from the test cases's outputs the programs' outputs are. I also have 6 islands, which are isolated groups of programs, that evolve within their own communities, and occasionally evolve across these communities as well. This helps to keep the population of programs diverse, thus speeding up the process of finding the right solution.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>For one thing, I am just starting to learn Clojure, the language I used for this project, and it is a fairly confusing language, especially for someone like me, who has no prior experience with lisp-based, or even functional languages. I had a lot of complications due to not knowing the language well, and it was hard to figure out how to import the library I am using, fungp. The error messages were very hard to understand, and testing and debugging Clojure is generally not very easy. There is no IDE that supports debugging in Clojure. In fact, I found it faster and easier to run it from terminal instead of an IDE. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of being able to complete this project in the given timeframe in the first place, especially so, because I do not know the language I used for the project very well. It was an amazing experience. \nI am also proud of being able to figure out the configurations that this project required, which I did mostly by trial and error, occasionally googling the problem to see if someone else ran into it. But not that many people use Clojure or genetic programming, so I did not find much.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to figure out things myself instead of googling for solutions (as stated before, often the solutions were not available online), and I learned a great deal about Clojure and genetic programming. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Guess-a-function</h2>\n<p>I want to explore genetic programming further, by trying out different ways to evolve the program to guess the functions, and then use statistical models to determine which performs better.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">clujure</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">fungp-library</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/emoshkovich/guess-a-function\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/emoshkovich/guess-a-function\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Walk With Me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mt4_epZdaRM?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Walk With Me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/087/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>App Icon</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Visit the website: <a href=\"http://walkwithme.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://walkwithme.azurewebsites.net/</a></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Being a college student is scary enough as it is - between homework, exams, internships, the social scene, extracurriculars, and more, the last thing students need to worry about is feeling safe on campus. Of course, Smith College, like other colleges and universities, is relatively safe, but being an open campus can make students uneasy, especially at night.  Having someone by your side as you are making the journey to the other side of campus, or the other side of the street, can help alleviate this uneasiness.  However, it is not always easy to find a friend who has also spent the last twelve hours working in the library.  Walk With Me allows students to find other peers in their neighboring area who they can share a walk with. </p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>Walk With Me helps Smith College students find other Smithies in the same, or surrounding, buildings.  In order to ensure security only those with smith.edu email address can sign up to use this app.  After having created an account the student may select a previously created route to, or near to their destination of choice.  If the route they desire is not available they may also choose to create their own route containing their current building, destination, and their estimated time of departure.  Walk With Me contains the names of all the buildings listed under a drop down menu to make the process simpler.  </p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>Made a web app using HTML+CSS, Javascript, PHP. and MySQL. Application is hosted on Azure.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>Getting a cloud database instance setup. Couldn\u2019t get it done due to technical issues. Solved it using our local SQL database.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments We Are Proud Of</h2>\n<p>Built an useful app keeping with the interests of Smith students. </p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>Very useful features of Microsoft Azure, making interactive web pages.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s Next?</h2>\n<p>Currently Walk With Me is a web app. The next step is to make it a phone app.  We feel by doing this the app will be easily accessible to students.  In order to make communication simpler we plan to implement a messaging system within the app allowing students to contact other students that share the same route as them.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://walkwithme.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://walkwithme.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>walkwithme.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["ZenBot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGG5Fl4f0GE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ZenBot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/681/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>When teachers assign students to a bag of flour to take care of, how can they grade the assignment?

The python program runs a classification operation where each url is assigned one of twelve categories based on meta description. It then outputs 4 files. These are figures and tables describing the data. It displays daily usage of data, top websites, top categories, and a productivity rate, that has been determined using values obtained in an anonymous survey of college students with the prompt, \"Would using a website of category \"\" be a waste of time?\".

However, buying or renting a car can also be environmental-unfriendly, tiring, and costly for students who don't travel often. Every time I return to school with my huge luggages, and get on Peterpan alone(and stressed out of missing the bus because of the airplane delays), I wished someone with a car could pick me up and go back to school together, and that was when I thought of the possibility of car-pooling within the pioneer valley. In fact, students travel back to school at approximately the same time, and it is totally feasible for the students to travel together. Therefore, I want to provide a platform for students in the Pioneer Valley to share seats and to find cars. Drivers post their traveling date, starting location and final destination, and the number of passengers they want; and car-poolers can also limit their search by the same criteria. In this way, they can quickly match together on the platform, and facilitate a travel plan together. </p>\n<p>Since I am a first-time coder working alone, the website still has much to be done. For example, I still don't know how to set up the registration page and to limit the registration to people with 5-college email address (as a matter of protection), I also don't know how to build the platform, to set up message box, or to do many other necessary things. So far, i only set up the front-page, but I am already extremely happy with my progress.

With so many health options, we decided to focus on mental health. Thus, we decided to track moods and help those who need that extra pick me up </p>\n<h2>What does it do?</h2>\n<p>It tracks your mood with your heart rate. </p>\n<h2>How did you make it?</h2>\n<p>Use the SDK for the Microsoft Band and programmed it with Java in Android Studio</p>\n<h2>What were some challenges</h2>\n<p>It was hard to find someone who specialized in Android Studio. There were some bugs, and the documentation was challenging. The size of the band is too large. </p>\n<h2>What are we proud of</h2>\n<p>We got it to work at some point. We got it to read each person's mood accurately at a given point. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>You got to push yourself, but also remember that you only have a limited amount of time. It doesn't have to be perfect. Also learned a lot about SDK's, API's, and the use of wearables. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Mood-o-meter</h2>\n<p>We can use the analytics to see how the persons mood changes throughout the day. We could also see how the combination of sensors along with mood tracking correlate to symptoms of mental and eating disorders like seasonal depression. We could also pair it up with other devices like the Muse headband so that we can track neural activity as well for a more refined reading. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]]]
