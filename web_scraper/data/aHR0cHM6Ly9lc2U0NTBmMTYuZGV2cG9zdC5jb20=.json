Our project focuses on optimizing patients flow at CHOP, reducing the time it takes for a patient to arrive at the emergency room and then be seen by a doctor. Our goal is to decrease the wait time for patients and improve the customer experience patients have at the hospital. Right now, the process is not very transparent and patients are not given an estimated wait time. With our predictive algorithm, we are able to map the available beds in the emergency room and give the charge nurse and estimate for how long patients will be waiting. We began by creating an algorithm that takes in a set of inputs from the charge nurse and then outputs an estimated wait time for the patients. The inputs include the patient's name, age, and severity of diagnosis, all of which determine how long their wait time will be. We made sure to incorporate the fact that higher severity patients will need to be seen first and also the current availability of beds and when those patients currently in the emergency room will be discharged.

Historically isolated regions, in particular, are seeing enhanced educational horizons due to an emerging industrial and nonprofit sector. One such region \u2013 coffee-growing Nicaragua \u2013 has been the beneficiary of work with the Seeds for Progress Foundation, a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization focusing on improving access to quality education and healthcare in Nicaragua.</p>\n<p>The foundation\u2019s flagship program, Digital Seeds is a holistic educational model designed to improve reading, writing and math skills; innovate processes and methods of teaching and learning; and integrate technology into the educational environment through intensive professional development and individual accompaniment of teachers.

There is a demonstrated need for a software that will facilitate more efficient, reliable, and robust collection, processing, analysis, and visualization of key educational efficacy metrics. </p>\n<p>This project aims to improve the quality of educational systems in rural Nicaragua by building an end-to-end software solution that will optimize the data collection and evaluation process, including testing metrics and resource utilization.

Using a video parsing tool that we built, we will collect data from video recordings of the Penn and Dartmouth's varsity men's soccer team games, analyze it using algorithms that our team builds, and use those results in a graphic application that coaches could use to plan team line-ups.</p>\n<h2>The mathematics behind the model</h2>\n<p>The network model, formally a Markov chain, assigns nodes to each player on the field, and connects these nodes using passing rates estimated from real data. We define additional nodes connected to each player, representing the \u201cgain\u201d or the \u201closs\u201d of possession, and the \u201cshot\u201d of the ball. Starting from the \u201cgain\u201d state and using the learned rates to determine the likeliness of different ball paths through the network, we estimate the probability that the ball will end in a shot instead of a turnover. We call this metric the probability of shooting before losing the ball (PSL). We empirically validate that this metric is strongly correlated with a team\u2019s win percentage.</p>\n<p>Our model allows to analyze which actions have the most significant impact in improving the winning probability before a game and act accordingly. Managers can learn which lineups provide the highest PSL. By looking at an opponent\u2019s network, a manager can determine the opponent\u2019s PSL and disrupt their chain. Furthermore, our model can be used to value players and player combinations. A manager can be able to tell if an acquisition is worthwhile given the change in PSL or a team can find players on the market that best fit its game strategy, maximizing the value of a purchase and detecting underpriced players. </p>\n<h2>What our technology does</h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve defined a central database as the core component of our project. The idea is that we would use our completed video processing tool to feed data into the database, which feeds important metrics and statistics of \u201ckey events\u201d that happen throughout a given game into the database to be stored. The definition of a \u201ckey event\u201d consists of, for example, recording passes, shots, shots on target, ball returning to field, and interceptions. In addition, each event has many descriptors. For example, when a pass occurs, it might be important to note which player made the pass and to who, if it was on target, if it was hit with the left or right foot, etc.</p>\n<p>We have also designed a database that consists of these \u201ckey events\u201d for individual games. We are preloading it with English Premier League data that we already have. We will later replace this data with that from Penn and Dartmouth soccer games once those videos are fully parsed. Coming out of the database is summary statistics and visualization for our end users to view and play around with.</p>\n<p>There are two parts to visualization: (1) individual player valuation and (2) team valuation. If we think about a soccer team as a Markov chain, the individual player valuation concerns a sensitivity analysis of a node on the Markov chain, while team valuation consists of defensive and offensive strategies to increase the probability of shooting before losing the ball (PSL). We plan on summarizing the statistics for a team both historically and for a given day (ex: Today, the team didn\u2019t work out because a particular player didn\u2019t do as well. If a center forward doesn\u2019t take enough shots in a given day because he/she didn\u2019t get the ball often enough, then we might blame the center forward, but it might not be his/her responsibility.) We want to give a coach a way to graphically modify the soccer team and these modifications\u2019 effects on PSL, and we want to strive to see if we can come up with a way to suggest specific types of players that are good for particular positions and come up with an optimal lineup ourselves.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Goalytics</h2>\n<p>By the end of the fall semester, we plan on having a barebones version of our app completed.

Oftentimes students spend exorbitant amounts on textbooks at the beginning of each semester, and fail to resell them after use--whether that is because the bookstore will not buy them back, or the students are simply lazy and/or cannot connect with the right buyers. Between the expense, the weight, and the space they take up, having used textbooks around is truly a burden. Existing platforms that enable students to buy and sell textbooks are inconvenient and inefficient, as they require significant effort and often do not result in a transaction--let alone clear the market.</p>\n<p>Thus, Bookworm aims to become the most convenient and efficient solution on the market for all textbook problems. In terms of front-end, Bookworm is a mobile app with an easy-to-use interface and features such as a barcode scanner that speed up the process of uploading books. The back-end of the app employs an algorithm that corresponds to a double auction economic model designed to optimally match buyers and sellers of a given textbook by finding a competitive equilibrium and clearing the market.</p>\n<p>By taking care of the matching process for users, Bookworm eliminates the burden of having to wait for a buyer or seller with the complementary supply or demand, respectively. The algorithm also maximizes the number of transactions possible given the price ranges requested by the users, providing users with the greatest probability of success in solving their textbook problems. With each iteration of the algorithm for a given book, in addition to falling within each user\u2019s requested ranges, the price is consistent for every buyer-seller pair, making the process fair for anyone involved. Both the convenience factor as well as the matching algorithm give Bookworm a competitive edge over existing platforms because they improve user experience in making textbook transactions. </p>\n<p>Fall semester our focus was on developing both this economic model and corresponding algorithm, as well as the fundamental features of the app. The algorithm was tested with data collected from a survey and proved to be efficient in that it cleared 90% of the market, and of the buyers and sellers who were not paired to make a trade, not one of them requested a price that a rational counterpart would accept. We plan to beta test the app in January as students look to sell their books from fall semester and buy their books for spring semester, and we will improve the app accordingly based on feedback regarding user experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["DigIt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGt4rSCy6zw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DigIt \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/446/779/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Title Slide</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>The DigIt project goal is to develop a website that can be a tool to help people garden in the empty lots throughout the Philadelphia area. By taking in certain inputs such as the size of the land, the time people are willing to commit, and preferences towards crops, the tool will provide a plan showing how many seeds to purchase and when to plant the seeds. Depending on whether the user wants to maximize profit or nutritional yield the model will follow different constraints to maximize the user's choice. </p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Currently, grocery markets charge a high price for healthy nutritional produce. As a result, many low income families are unable to get a balanced and nutritional diet, leading to other unhealthy alternatives that could be physically damaging in the future. Simultaneously, there are also a lot of open lots throughout Philadelphia that are not being used. Current research and past efforts suggest that by using empty lost to generate produce, many low income households would be able to purchase produce at a cheaper price. By studying past efforts and examining the reasons for failure, it is possible to create a better system that is able to solve the known difficulties. Our proposed solution is worth trying not only because of the overwhelming benefits it provides to society, but also because the project considers possibilities that were not considered for previous efforts. Ultimately, DigIt will solve the problem of costly nutritional produce by providing an application that gives step by step instructions to farming based off of specified inputs so that local communities can grow their own food.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>DigIt is an online tool that individuals in the West Philadelphia area can use to help make the process of planning and implementing a community garden more efficient. There are thousands of vacant lots in the Philadelphia area. It is possible to purchase one of these locations or obtain permission to convert the lots into a community garden, thereby creating a great opportunity to provide nutritional produce to the community at a low cost. Our tool uses the Simplex algorithm to generate a model that will assist users who have information about a plot in optimizing which crops to grow to maximize their preferences, profit, or nutritional return. The site will also send reminders to the user concering actionable items regarding their plot within the garden. In order to obtain a permit to convert one of these plots, individuals must provide the city with a plan for continued attention to the project. Our product will help to increase the number of gardens approved by the city, by providing a clear plan to those interested. The value of our product goes beyond gardens and offers great social and environmental benefits.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/excel\">excel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lingo</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["VariChill ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VariChill  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/446/771/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Abstract</p>\n<p>Each year, more than 3 million people die from diseases that can be prevented by widely available vaccines. Approximately 1.5 million of these deaths are in children less than 5 years old. The primary reason for these deaths is that vaccines must be stored at a specific temperature at all times. The goal of our project is to create a solar powered refrigerator that can be used for vaccine storage in developing nations - particularly in areas with limited access to the power grid. As per guidelines set by the World Health Organization, the fridge will maintain an ambient temperature of between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius and will be able to maintain said temperature without access to solar power for up to 5 days.  We hope to achieve this goal through the use of thermoelectric cooling elements, ultra-effective insulation and a passive heat exchange system. A wireless-enabled embedded system will monitor and control the refrigerator's temperature, duty cycle and other key features.  The entire system can be powered via a solar panel array, the battery backup or grid power (when it is available). </p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Szf0wJzaE&amp;feature=youtu.be\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8Szf0wJzaE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.youtube.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I work on the Electrical Engineering elements such as circuit and power system design, and solar integration.", "I work mechanical engineering, heat transfer, manufacture and design parts.

This gym includes a variety of different machines which allow operation without physician oversight leading to strong clinical outcomes, and a fun, interactive therapy in the form of video games. The project has been started, but is not close to completion. </p>\n<p>Our team will focus on working with pedal bikes which will strengthen the lower arm, upper arm, and legs of the patient. These pedal bikes currently do not have any smart features, however we intend on adding an IMU in order to track the speed and number of rotations the patient pedals. Using this information, we will create an algorithm that will then feed back to the bike to power a stepper motor. This stepping motor would allow us to automatically rotate the knob that adjusts the level of resistance the bike pedals have. If time allows, we would also add force sensing to the bike pedals in order to gather information on how the patient grips the handles and use that data to inform us on how the patient is doing as well. Furthermore, as a software component we intend on building a web app that will allow physicians to follow the progress of various patients who are using the machines to see if desired goals and outcomes are being reached. If we have time, we also want to create games for patients who are using the pedal bikes (ie. integrating with a known game such as Temple Run). </p>\n<p>A large component of our project will involve prototyping and testing quickly, because we want to deliver a usable product so getting input from our users and iterating accordingly will be extremely fundamental in our process. Ultimately, we hope our project will help to create a usable smart pedal bike system and our progress will allow the Rehabilitation Robotics lab to complete their vision of an affordable gym for developing countries. </p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["ESE450-SuperResolution", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ESE450-SuperResolution \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/446/817/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Upscaling low resolution video using a super resolution framework to reduce bandwidth.</h2>\n<p>The goal of our project is to build a mobile application that upscales low-resolution images and video. Every day hundreds of millions of  videos travel over wireless networks all around the world. Everyone who has a mobile phone wants to watch video in the highest resolution available, but sending and receiving high resolution video takes an excessive amount of bandwidth. Combine general trends in video communication with the rise of video streaming as a service on mobile devices, and it\u2019s clear why communication networks are strained for bandwidth. Even recently, large companies such as AT&amp;T have forced customers into using lower default resolutions when streaming video. With our product, customers will no longer have to make a decision between using less data and watching higher resolution video. We intend to make it as easy to send/receive/view high resolution video as it is to normally send and watch video.
