This weekend, while playing music tracks on the trip to Melbourne, Florida for FloridaTechHacks 2016, we realized there are more <strong>groups like us that want to play all the music, but only have one main speaker blasting the tracks.</strong></p>\n<h2>What you're here for.</h2>\n<p><strong>METROBOOM</strong> is a jukebox app that operates peer-to-peer on Android phones. A host phone connected to a speaker via Bluetooth generates a queue with a generated room code to share with people nearby. People can connect to the host phone and add locally saved songs to the queue, which will play on the host's speaker.</p>\n<p><strong>METROBOOM</strong> is awesome for people music lovers that want to share their music with their friends in real time, whether they're hanging out and chilling or DJing a party.</p>\n<p><strong>Connect your music.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Connect your speaker.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Connect your party.</strong></p>\n<h2>The details.</h2>\n<p><strong>React Native</strong> was used for coding the front-end.</p>\n<p><strong>Webtorrent</strong> and <strong>socket.io</strong> was used for the back-end to make peer-to-peer connections.</p>\n<h2>Fam, it wasn't easy.</h2>\n<p>Due to FloridaTechHacks 2016 being a 24-hour hack-a-thon, we opted for a minimum viable product (MVP) that supports only Android and shares only music tracks. We know that peer-to-peer sharing has unlimited potential, where networks of people can share any sorts of data (documents, images, and other files) without Wi-Fi. </p>\n<p><strong>METROBOOM</strong> also had other planned feature that we'd love to add, but since we're on a time restraint, we did what we do best.</p>\n<h2>We did gud fam.</h2>\n<p>Major League Hacking pushes us to our limits to get a real MVP going. In particular, FloridaTechHacks holds a standard of viable and valuable projects that have worth and application to the real world. <strong>METROBOOM</strong> isn't just a cool lookin' app for music lovers and song sharers, but we're proud of how far we've come with applying ourselves to mesh net projects, and are confident in our work.</p>\n<h2>What we learn?</h2>\n<p><strong>Kerlin</strong>, one of our front-end developers, learned how to use React Native for the first time. This is his first time being a front-end developer in a hack-a-thon as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Angelo</strong>, another front-end developer, is also learning React Native for the first time. METROBOOM is his first experience with a phone app project.</p>\n<p><strong>Annabelle</strong>, a newbie to coding, learned a few more coding terms and learned more about the design process for a modern-looking app. They don't teach us this in classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Alastair</strong>, our back-end dev, has never worked on a project of this scope within 24-hours, and has plugged himself in for awhile, so I'm not sure what he learned but he's grindin' hard.</p>\n<h2>METROBOOM: the future</h2>\n<p>We want to expand <strong>METROBOOM</strong> by adding awesome features to it. We want people in the queues to be able to upvote and downvote tracks, affecting their play priority. In general, we know that peer-to-peer connections and mesh nets, the basis of <strong>METROBOOM</strong>, has unlimited potential that we want to push to the public.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webtorrent</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MetroBoom\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/MetroBoom\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built the backend real-time socket server with NodeJS, handled BitTorrent streaming protocol, handled integrations with mobile app and helped coordinate development of React Native mobile app.", "Branding, Marketing.

By using our solution, various organizations can track movement in restricted zones, make sure that the parkings are clear of visitors and much much more!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There is Raspberry+Arduino part with 2 sonic sensors that detects cars and direction it goes in. The system also has an ID of a parking lot it stays at and wi-fi capability to report car movement to the cloud service web platform.</p>\n<p>The web platform provides user interface and API to show and edit parking lot data. Users are able to see the statistics on all of the parking spots in the DB and filter them out to see the ones that are free. There is a proper REST API to extend the service to IoT reality by asking your phone in advance which parking lots have available spaces and whether the parking lot near the building you are going to is busy at all.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We brought in 3D Printer, Arduino, Raspberry Pi (FabLab), and 2 sonic sensors (thanks to FabLab) and wired them up together and wrote C and Python code to detect car movement and pass this data through POST requests to our web platform.</p>\n<p>We also built Amazon AWS server with Database to provide a public accessible cloud platform to track parking spots with public API in case anyone wants to build an utility tool to automate it even more</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>We had major problems with detecting best approximation of distance (sonic sensors were jumping from 2m to 1cm for some time screwing up all our calculations)</p></li>\n<li><p>Getting the right hardware.

LogicBoard was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It provides an on Cloud E-Learning platform for digital logic.\nFeatures:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web server and REST API in the cloud to share the digital logic designs</li>\n<li>Professor can upload a project students can download, view and modify</li>\n<li>Students can modify the project and upload the changes</li>\n<li>Projects can be shared by multiple users to allow study groups</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We used Unity3D game engine and C# to develop the simulator for the digital logic circuit, and provide multi-platform support. \nWe used the combo PHP, Apache, and MySQL over an Amazon EC2 instance to host the website for the project and provide the REST API for the sharing functionalities. Finally, we used 3DMax to design beautiful and appealing components.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We registered the domain <a href=\"http://LogicBoard.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://LogicBoard.com</a>, but for some reason the DNS took a lot of time to propagate. Polishing the user interface required an extensive amount of time. Time was challenging for us, we faced tons of technical issues in the given 24h but with the great teamwork we solved and finished our project on time and it is ready to test on this link: <a href=\"http://54.201.66.40/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://54.201.66.40/index.html</a></p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are impressed of ourselves for having implemented an almost complete multi-platform application and the respective website and APIs in only 24h. LogicBoard provides features that are present in pay to use softwares, and it has the exclusivity for this type of tools to provide the ability to modify, upload, and share the circuit across multiple people.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Unity3D is a great tool for developers. In just few hours a person can get decently comfortable with the environment and be productive. Few tools offer such power. Amazon EC2 proved again to be the best companion for the web developers that need to quickly deploy a web server and a REST API end point.</p>\n<h2>What's the next for logic board</h2>\n<p>There is still much work to polish the application, but the basic functionalities are already in place and we are potentially ready to publish on Android store.\nSome features that would be worth to add are those that increase the interactivity and usefulness of LogicBoard as an E-Learning platform, that would make it compete with much more expensive products, e.g.,:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>project can be uploaded by the students and checked automatically to get a grade</li>\n<li>students can share their design on a public library </li>\n<li>students can download the designs of other students an import them in their own personal libraries</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3dmax</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-10\">windows-10</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mac\">mac</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://54.201.66.40/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://54.201.66.40/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>54.201.66.40</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed and modeled the main gates of LogicBoard , managed project files, wrote presentation, created project profile, and presented to judge committees.", "I designed and implemented the serialization to JSON format of the digital logic circuit.\nI also wrote some of the boilerplate stuff, like the story for the project.", "I designed the backend implementation for pushing and pulling the serialized circuits.", "I built the circuit simulator algorithm back-end and the UI in Unity3D."]], ["Off The Farms", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Off The Farms \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/370/132/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our biggest inspiration was to create a unique idea which benefited the local community as well as encourage gardening.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We came up with this unique idea that we would sell seeds to local families and they would grow the fresh produce right from their backyard and sell it through our website. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the Website using Wordpress with woo commerce.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge for us was to narrow down on a single idea that is feasible and doable within 24 hours whilst making sure that it does not already exist.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of working in a team who all belong is different departments and bringing in their specialities to work on this project.

It is running a modified version of raspbian called Rachel Pi.   This allows for the Pi to act as a server that hosts the Web app. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The web app is built using Javascript, Html5, Css, and bootstrap.  The information from the web app is stored on a lamp server.  The raspberry pi uses a 32Gb sd card that holds the operating system while the database is on a 32Gb flash drive. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were a lot of challenges when setting up the web server.  Our first idea was to use an idea called PiRateBox which allows for anonymous offline file sharing.  We planned to add PHP and MySQL to the design to allow us to host the web page.  The problems we ran into with this idea is we could not connect the device to the internet in order to install the necessary files to run Apache and in return PHP and MySQL.  We spent more time than we should have trying to make this work.</p>\n<p>We also tried another form of a raspbian server, but also had trouble connecting to the internet to install necessary functions. Even with the OS we chose, we still had trouble getting updates from online.  The main cause of this is because we were making an offline server.</p>\n<p>We were unsuccessful in creating an access point for the server. We believe it is because we are trying to make an access point at the same time as we are trying to download updates from the internet.</p>\n<p>The hardest part with the WebApp was using the new Bootstrap 4 (in beta) instead of the old Bootstrap3.XX.  It also proved difficult using Jquery to work with the new bootstrap </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The web app ended up looking really good.  We are proud that we could learn the new Bootstrap 4 even though it is still in beta.  The new graphs and input selections that we were able to learn showed to be a great learning experience and success. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the difficulties that come with trying to make a server that is offline.  We also learned some new tools and techniques to make awesome web apps that have a simple user interface.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Scout FRC WebApp</h2>\n<p>The use of thebluealliance.com API will be added.  The use of github webhook in order to allow the web app to be updated on the Pi whenever the github repository is updated. Then the app can be used at the competition this Spring and every competition after.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intellij-idea\">intellij-idea</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bootstrap4</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rachelproject\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rachelproject\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sparksc/Scout-FRC_WebApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sparksc/Scout-FRC_WebApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["FloridaTech Trolley Tracker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FloridaTech Trolley Tracker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/370/246/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FloridaTech Trolley Tracker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/370/247/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FloridaTech Trolley Tracker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/370/248/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FloridaTech Trolley Tracker \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/370/249/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FloridaTech Trolley Tracker \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/370/250/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I live in Wood Hall, right next to the trolley station. However, for the past 2 semesters, I have only taken the trolley 8 times. Very often, I hear the train leave right when I rush down the stairs. I really hope the trolley could have a detailed schedule or a tracker app.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The django website is built for both drivers and students. The drivers can login and update the GPS location of the trolleys as long as they are logged in. For students, they can see their current location, trolley stations and where trolleys are. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The front-end is built with HTML5, javascript, CSS, bootstrap and jQuery. The back-end is built with python and django. We used Google Map API as well.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We spent several hours trying to figure out how to communicate between front-end and back-end. At first, we tried to use Get method but it did work very well. So after several trials, we decided to use django's built in functions and regular expression. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>To be honest, I doubted if we could finish a project like this in 24 hours. I'm really glad we did. I'm also very proud that I can use my programming skills to solve real problems and maybe help other people who are troubled just like me.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>24 hours seems short, but if we have a goal in mind, there is actually a lot that we can do in this short amount of time. It's fun to work with friends.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for FloridaTech Trolley Tracker</h2>\n<p>We are currently using urls to communicate between front/back end and update our database. Although this is very convenient, this is also very unsafe. People who know this pattern can use this to change information in the database into whatever they want. Our next step is to find a safer way to do this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/oliwang/Trolley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/oliwang/Trolley\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [".", "", "", ""]], ["Shotgun Jam: The app called it first!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shotgun Jam: The app called it first! \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/370/222/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: Well, as much as we LOVE listening to music while driving, sometimes it can be distracting, especially during high traffic times or when there is a crash on the route.</h2>\n<h2>What it does: It will essentially pause  or lower of volume of the music when it encounters a high pressure situation as per google maps, like a crash, a busy intersection or a gridlock nightmare.

We also all learned about Data Mining, Scrapping Data and using Big Data.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for SafeTravels things. Hopefully we'll be able to add more data to improve the results for the future and have it be more user friendly. We also hope that we will be able to find more data sets to allow us to expand our city search outside of the United States</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mfajet/SafeTravels\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mfajet/SafeTravels\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the algorithm in R which sorted through the databases, ranked the different cities by their different safety levels and took in values and allow results vary based off of user preferences.

When duplicated reports happen, the latter ones would be ignored. When a missing marker or eraser is supplemented, it will be deleted from the table. If the reporter of a missing marker or eraser found the marker or eraser after reporting it, he or she can also report it as a \"have\", so that the former report will be canceled.\nLink to the GitHub repository:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/natewatson999/MarkerMarker/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/natewatson999/MarkerMarker/</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://104.236.236.17\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://104.236.236.17\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>104.236.236.17</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front-end and server deployment", "", "", ""]]]
