After the Microsoft keynote we we were inspired to make something just a little sarcastic. We saw the Clarifai API and realized the possibilities were endless.</p>\n<p>After a little brainstorming we came up with a little idea where users can upload a photo and it will take tags from the uploaded image and generate free verse poetry related to those tags. We used something called Markov Chains with the help of some long works from our favorite authors (Edgar Allen Poe and Sigmund Freud) we used massive text samples to generate lines of poetry. For good measure we also used the tumblr API to scrap posts with the tag 'poetry' so out text sample includes over 2,000 tumblr posts. Each line is seeded by a tag and these lines are sorted in descending order of how sure the Clarifai API is.</p>\n<p>We have a node server with a custom REST API that we wrote the handle all poem generation. We also used jQuery and Bootstrap to make our frontend and a python script to scrape tumblr and compile all our text into a unified format.</p>\n<p>We had a ton of fun making this application and we hop you love it too!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhand2/PocketHipster\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jhand2/PocketHipster\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pocket-hipster.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pocket-hipster.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pocket-hipster.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["\u00c9l\u00e9gance", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7CFsGiJwwsc?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>Has your wife been passively angry at you?

It is also the first language and mother tongue to many hearing people and some deafblind people. However, there is a radical gap in communication between the deaf and other members of society -- the vast majority of citizens do not know how to speak sign language. As a result, we sought to use the Leap Motion to create a seamless, intuitive manner of sign language translation.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ASLSpeak utilizes the Leap Motion to gather a variety of data on the motions of the hands of a sign language user, and feeds it into a machine learning algorithm to classify which letter or word was gesticulated. After identifying what was signed, ASLSpeak utilizes a laptop's text to speech to say the translation.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used python to collect training data on sign language users, and inputted it into a neural network classification algorithm. After we successfully trained the classifier, we wrote a script to take user input (through sign language via the leap motion) and automatically speak it.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our neural network accounted for over 350 different features of a user's hand, so it was often a bit slow to be used in everyday normal conversation. Additionally, we had only 24 hours to build a script to gather training data, create training data, create the neural network classifier, and write the script to translate user input. With more time, we could generate better training data and increase the speed, which would do wonders for its usability as a tool in everyday speech.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We had little to no machine learning experience coming into the hackathon, and definitely feel like we've learned a lot more about this interesting technology.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ASLSpeak</h2>\n<p>Development of ASLSpeak does not stop with the end of DubHacks.

By following eye and mouth movements, we can record metrics to track distraction and mood. In particular, we analyze smiling, head angle and eye focus. In addition we synchronize this data with map and speed information to develop driving trends and point out hazardous patterns or reward improvements.</p>\n<p>In particular, the tracked metrics are distractedness, happiness and fidgetiness, but more could be added such as hand position and center of gravity.</p>\n<p>The metrics are logged on web app accessible from browsers and mobile devices. It is designed to be simple and easy to understand. An overall score is determined every drive, as well as specific categories  for more detail. A user can look at a timeline map that displays markers on the coordinates of significant distraction events. Ideally patterns may emerge and habits may change.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Kinect is processed with the supplied api. We process various face information and print it on the stream and send it out to our flask server. We used python for post processing, analysis and integrating the server. Node and React were used on the mobile phone side to pull Google maps data and draw event markers on a map. The front end is a combination React, jQuery and Google material design.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many of our early struggles were on the vision side. It was tough to find example of advanced facial recognition on the Kinect, and working with Visual studio. The python processing was also difficult since we wanted to simplify all the data in to something any user could understand. We struggled with React and cloud web services and spent much of our time bouncing around between services. In general our team put emphasis on learning new things (React, Python Flask, Visual Studio, ect) rather than staying in our comfort zone. This inherently made things difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Accurate, reliable face tracking</li>\n<li>Visual C++</li>\n<li>Creative metrics</li>\n<li>Google maps</li>\n<li>React</li>\n<li>Hardware</li>\n<li>Simple design</li>\n<li>Making something that has potential to improve safety</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Expect anything.

Facebook, as James Whittaker mentioned, is slowly becoming a place for people to show off about their lives. Twitter is a place for people to be clever -- even that is growing more slowly than ever. We believed that a better, more true-to-life alternative existed for people to express themselves, one less constrained by social stigma and pedigree. We came up with Lyte, an emotions tracking social network. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Lyte allows friends, family, coworkers to express themselves in a variety of emotions. Words are hard -- it's magnitudes more difficult to know how to say something, than how to feel something. When people are suicidal or depressed, the most painful experience they manage is the feeling that no one is there for them. In many ways, Lyte allows friends to be more socially responsible and responsive to the signals of their peers. That's why we believe Lyte is the best alternative for personal expression out there. You log in with Facebook, and are presented with a list of friends you would like in your intimate list of connections. From there, you are prompted to share your current emotional state. Additionally, you get a glance-able dashboard populated with how your friends are doing on a daily or weekly timeline. In the future, we see a notification and messaging system integrated with the product, where  emotions act as conversation starters.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built all the components of Lyte from scratch, starting from the Postgresql datastore to the API and Web server in Node.js to the front end in React, d3.js and HTML/CSS. Of course we leveraged the many tools at our disposal like Amazon EC2, Facebook's Graph API, Bootstrap, Express JS, and a SQL ORM. However, because we wanted a larger degree of control over the models, endpoints, and authentication, we chose to stick to as bare of a setup as time permitting for our goals.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We wanted to cover a lot of areas with very little time. We wanted architectural control from a technical perspective, but we also wanted to stick true to our philosophy that Lyte would be of high social value. We wanted to provide users with visualization, analytics, networking, and a very comforting atmosphere to share their more private emotions in. Reaching all these goals while wrangling with the standard tech/design/collaboration speed bumps was challenging.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of building an end to end product from the models to the API to the React-based front end. At times it seemed like none of our components would come together in time. We're proud that we built a product that helps our peers not only at their happiest moments, but could aid them in their more stressful and upsetting times. We're proud that we worked nonstop throughout the night to build a stable (as possible given the time) and flexible social network.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Each of our team members got a unique learning experience at Dubhacks 2015. Some of us reached into front-end and design work when they were primarily devops and backend. We worked with new SQL to Javascript ORM interfaces to manage our models and API. We managed to learn about data visualization techniques and information presentation. All in all, we each took away a valuable, concrete skill to use in our own personal projects and lives.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Lyte</h2>\n<p>We hope to spend a short amount of time getting the key features Lyte needs to succeed in the real world (messaging, notifications, mobile support) before getting it as fast as possible to end users. We feel like on college campuses in particular, peer influence is extremely powerful and we want to leverage that in a way that helps people ubiquitously. We want to explore exploits of our system and see how we deal with abuse as it arises in any social network. Ultimately, we want to do as much as possible to see people enjoying the value they get from being able to express themselves more easily and without as much inhibition.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sequelize</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://lyteup.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lyteup.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>lyteup.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/danfang/15f-dubhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/danfang/15f-dubhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Backend, SQL, Data Visualization", "", "", "", ""]], ["Binary Circuit Builder", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Binary Circuit Builder \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/718/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I've always wanted to build a huge computer in Minecraft, but the game is terribly slow for handling very complex redstone circuits.

But what website is fully comprehensive when it comes to social media and your education? You don't necessarily want to add classmates to your Facebook friend list but you may want to collaborate with them for classes. The goal of Uni is to provide and connect students of the same colleges and classes together. Uni students can discuss about their major, their specific courses, or even ask questions and form study groups together. Uni is a way of providing a social media outlet for students within universities as well as helping build further connections for future networking. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Uni allows students in the same university to collaborate, discuss, and study together. Group pages can encompass your specific courses, your majors, or even just your graduating class year. Newsfeeds appear as statuses with students asking questions and creating discussion posts. Furthermore you can form chat groups for class projects for any course. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our group used a mixture of HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)/Javascript (Angular.JS) and Firebase for back-end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into challenges with getting Firebase to work well with creating groups and subgroups as well as implementing a chat tool. Instead we compromised by leaving these completely static and front-end. The concepts and displays are there still. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>User authentication and account creation through Firebase works. Beautiful front-end design work for login page and home page. Overall just a nice-looking site that captures the goal of the website. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We initially did not have a lot of design-experience within our team so we learned a lot on the fly. Furthermore we learned how to work with user-authentication.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Uni</h2>\n<p>Just look into developing it more so that we can further progress our skills and learn even more things. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://students.washington.edu/bennyt2/dubhacks2015/#/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://students.washington.edu/bennyt2/dubhacks2015/#/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>students.washington.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["BellHapp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Problems\nLong Wait Times for Service\nInability To Make Impulse Buys \nFeedback Only From Extremes </p>\n<p>How We Solve it?\nMenu++\nOrdering\nSignaling \nFeedback\nIncrease Sales</p>\n<p>What is the Market Like?\nThe millennial population (aged 18-34) is expected to be the largest population group by 2016, and the largest group of restaurant patrons.

Unfortunately for this brilliant time wasting idea it quickly devolved into dankness, both in terms of memes and otherwise. By the time cocaine came around, the plug had to be pulled. \nWe thought this was a shame. We thought if only freedom of speech was constricted in some way, censored in fact, the screen could show, nice, vanilla, <del>state sponsored</del>, images and tweets with little to no moderator effort. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This app takes images with a certain hashtag, runs them through Clarifai's API for tags, and censors any image with one or more undesired tag (as specified by the user)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This project with built primarily in Python, with a Javascript web front-end, and AWS server hosting for the back-end (last minute errors may end up with us using a separate hosting service). Key APIs used were the Twitter API, and the Clarifai API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>AWS proved difficult to use in our sleep-deprived state, especially since none of our group had much if any experience in web hosting. While we got through it in the end, we spent more than three hours debugging a single, now dreaded, error message. \nWe also had a lot of trouble using the part of Clarifai's API for training new tags, to the point we were forced to abandon that part of our project.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm very happy that the project managed to come together, despite all of us having to pull together to learn multiple new ideas (some of our group was writing Python for the first time), and despite none of us knowing each other before the competition. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I personally learned a lot about web hosting, and simple http requests. My group members report much of the same, along with learning in Python, and even in use of Github. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Twitter Filter</h2>\n<p>We aren't sure what will come next for this app idea. We have lots of ways to flesh it out, especially involving analysis of tweet text itself, and use of Clarifai's training algorithms to allow users to create custom tag bans. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tweepy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dhlanm/dubhacksfilter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dhlanm/dubhacksfilter/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://vgel.me:9001\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://vgel.me:9001\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>vgel.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["NeighborChat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to redefine the term neighbor to expand to a greater area with our randomized chat system that is location based.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>NeighborChat allows us to communicate with those in close proximity through video and chat.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We collaborated using git and Node.js.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>duo&amp;chill</strong></h2>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are all passionate about League of Legends, with 3 of us being active leaders in the League of Legends club on campus. One of our main pain points in the past year has been fostering a community among our members outside of the game itself. Frequently, players engage others online, but are never able to put a face to the Summoner name. <strong>duo&amp;chill</strong> encourages and incentivizes players to leave the comfort of their home and establish an organic relationship with around a shared passion: League of Legends.</p>\n<p>League of Legends is a game that is played by over <strong>70 million</strong> unique users per month. College aged players are the most influential demographic, thus the significance of having collegiate communities rises significantly. Yet, if players are not engaging one another outside the game, the community is not as healthy as it could be. <strong>duo&amp;chill</strong> aims to solve this problem through a service that allows players to connect with others that live nearby.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We thought that the best way to approach this problem would be through a web service. We wanted a simple, easy to navigate and use interface that was also visually appealing. To do this, we utilized Angular.js, as well as a Python backend and Google's Firebase platform for our database. To acces the user's location, we requested the device's location services with geolocation from those devices. After getting the geolocation and snagging the user's longitude and latitude, we plotted their location on an embedded Bing Map. For users to see the other users that were in the area, we used an algorithm from Algorithmia that took two geolocation points and returned the distance between the two in miles. Then, we used the Python back end to talk to Riot Games' API to acces the user's player information, which included various images and information about them from League of Legends. Finally, we utilized Amazon Web Services to host the actual site. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the primary challenges that we faced was with the communication between the back end and front end functionalities. Since we wanted to try out Firebase, we thought the most intutitive and comfortable approach would be through Angular.js. Our back end developer was most comfortable working in Python, so we divided that work up evenly. However, Firebase did not have an easy way to integrate Python with Angular.js, so navigating that with thrid party Python packages a challenge that we eventually hurdled. </p>\n<p>The biggest challenge was each person's different comfort level and experience doing web and software development. A tricky task was finding a way that we could divide the work up evenly, such that we all had something to do, and that the work was not skewed towards one or two members of the team. We found that even though some of our members wanted to work on a specific area, there was still important work that needed to be completed. However, this was a great way for members to branch out of their comfort zone and engage in a new and unqiue learning experience. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are extremely proud of the fact that we were able to integrate so many pieces of the puzzle together to deliver an awesome product for our peers. When we began, we thought that we would use definitely, maybe two external features or sources, yet in actuality, we incorporated so many different resources and technologies that we blew our own minds. We truly believe that this product will have a direct impact on the community that we live in. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all taught eachother something new, which was a very pleasant and engaging experience. Since we all were of different skill levels of hacking, coding, and designing, we all picked up a significant amount of information that we never knew before this weekend. The primary takeaway from this event though, was the that we learned that we can built really awesome stuff if we work as a cohesive and responsive team. </p>\n<h2>What's next for duo&amp;chill</h2>\n<p>We definitely want to finish all of the functionalities that we planned for <strong>duo&amp;chill</strong>, and then ship the final product to help relieve the pain points that we are experiencing in the League of Legends club on campus. Ideally, we would integrate this service into our other community projects to help create a more distinct and healthy gaming culture at the University of Washington. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">algorithmia</span></li><li></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-maps\">bing-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gps\">gps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/riot-games\">riot-games</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://duoandchill.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://duoandchill.me/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>duoandchill.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lizabethd/duoandchill\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lizabethd/duoandchill\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Chatl;dr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Chatl;dr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/719/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Chatl;dr \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/720/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Chatl;dr \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/721/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Chatl;dr \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/722/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Chatl;dr \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/723/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Chatl;dr \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/724/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>While working on projects with a team, it can be hard to keep up with around-the-clock electronic communication. It is difficult to enter a conversation midway without feeling lost, and searching through an old conversation for specific information can be tiresome. We set out to create an app that would make team communication a more efficient and enjoyable experience.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app takes all the information of a group chat and synthesizes it into a chat summary. The components of the summary include common topics that have appeared in the chat, dates that have been scheduled, and tasks that members of the chat can assign to themselves or other people. These functions put all of the important information in one place, making group work and discussions simpler.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started by brainstorming ways to quantify the information in a conversation and thinking of how we could synthesize it into an easy to understand summary. With the algorithm in mind, we began creating a template for the chat login and interface pages using HTML and CSS, with styling from Google's Material Design specification. At the same time, parts of our team worked on integrating the template with Firebase to provide user authentication and a database for group conversations. Finally, we pulled it all together, creating a responsive, clean interface with robust error-checking and unique chat-summarizing features.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had challenges using the Watson Concept Insights, which would have allowed us to analyze text and come up with keywords of the conversation to show the user. We also were originally planning on allowing users to login with Facebook, and we were able to prompt a Facebook login box, but were ultimately unable to integrate the login with our website due to recurring errors. Thus, we developed our own user account entry system with Firebase.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the clean interface of our app, the ease of use, the asynchronous updating and tracking of online users with Firebase, and the innovative idea.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it's hard to predict what can go wrong when using an external API, and that user experience and functionality are both important; we should never focus on one at the expense of the other. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Chatl;dr</h2>\n<p>We want to integrate better machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, using MEAN stack to allow for Bluemix product functionality. Additionally, we would like to create a full-featured chat interface that will reach the full capacity of our innovative idea.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">html/css</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end of the project, creating the chat interface and integrating the HTML/CSS with the Firebase backend code.

However, few applications provide a truly cross-platform solution for listening to podcasts. Resonate was built with the intention of allowing users to listen to podcasts wherever they are, on whatever platform - whether it's mobile, desktop, or something else.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Right now, Resonate is relatively basic: users can search for podcasts, drill down into episodes for a specific podcast, and play episodes. And that's about it.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built Resonate using AngularJS, JQuery, and Bootstrap. I used the iTunes API to search for podcasts, and used JQuery to parse RSS feed URLs and extract data from each.

Not only do we have to pay for our own food, but we have to figure out when to re-stock. Collaborate with friends and bring in the gang for a connected experience, tracking food at the press of a button.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>After some initial white-board drawing and brainstorming, around a pot of steaming French Press, we came to the idea. We interfaced with Firebase for our relational database, storing our server assets and all of our ooey-goey code. Bootstrap provided a great way to start building and implementing our front end. We kept in mind that mobile-centric design was our intended goal. Working with Clarifai, images could be queried and traced for hooks and tags to come out. In other words, put in an image of a banana and some words describing a banana come out!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Firebase oscillated from being our best friend to a tiresome companion. Working with the mentors was crucial to our understanding and improvement. The Clarifai API was rather unclear and we toiled to \"train\" our processing algorithms and improve the control of our analysis. Only to find later in the competition that the API was not prepared for that just yet.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our spirits stayed high throughout the 24 hour hackathon and I couldn't be more proud of the spirit of my teammates as we battled against bugs and laughed through merge conflicts.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Bootstrap, a ton more Git and building more with a team.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Icebox</h2>\n<p>Iceboxx is fully functional and we plan to use it within the coming weeks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/less\">less</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bootrstrap</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/johannesburg/icebox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/johannesburg/icebox\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["ImgSort", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ImgSort \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/666/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The Clarifai API and presentation</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sorts images in directories based on categories that the user sets.

They have to search for a link on the packaging, go to the website, find the feedback form, then submit the form. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Consumers can easily scan the UPC code of a product to give it a review. For bad products, the consumers must provide proof with an image of the product, and reasons to why they gave it a bad review. By doing reviews, users earn points that can be redeemed for prizes. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Java and Android Studio to built Scanigy. We also used Adobe Invision to create an interactive prototype, and used Adobe Illustrator to create the components. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It was a challenge alone just attempting to develop an Android app for the first time. XML was confusing to use at first, so we had to watch online tutorials. Combing ZXing project with our project was especially challenging because we ran into many bugs. We had to read through the code and figure out what was wrong, and there was no resources we could use to make this process go by quicker. Finally, we had trouble dealing with Android's threading and background tasks, specifically with implementing AsyncTask, Activity, and Service. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We all came to DubHacks alone and did not know what to expect because it was everyone's first time at a hackathon. Even so, we all spent the night together hacking away. While the end product is not as nice as we would like, we ended up with a pretty good prototype and had a solid idea on a product. Our biggest achievement was using ZXing to read UPC bar codes to pull the information from an API located at upcbarcode.org</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>UPC, API, Android Studio, XML</p>\n<h2>What's next for Scanigy</h2>\n<p>Getting better at programming in a multi-thread environment so we can finish Scanigy, </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/zxing\">zxing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">invision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.scanigy.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.scanigy.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.scanigy.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tekgeek88/Scanigy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tekgeek88/Scanigy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["User-flow, visual design, wireframe, prototype, website, presentation ", "- Back-end and front-end with Java. \n- Implementation of network-based code. \n- UI coding\n", "I connected the upcdatabase.org api and implemented ZXing barcode scanner using Android Studio.", ""]], ["Cognition", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Missing classes due to unavoidable circumstances</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows users to upload the photos of notes anonymously so that others can view them.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We divided the team into half.

AirMed is easy enough to use that people without access to healthcare professionals can still receive proper treatment. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cortana\">cortana</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">windows-universal-platform</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-10\">windows-10</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sethdp/Dubhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sethdp/Dubhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Bread Crumbs", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gm87r-0vWXE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bread Crumbs \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/552/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bread Crumbs \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/554/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bread Crumbs \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/551/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bread Crumbs \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/553/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bread Crumbs \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/549/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration and what it does</h2>\n<p>Ever have a friend hype a new place, but every time you're near it you forget? Or you finally remember that you need to buy groceries just as you enter your driveway?</p>\n<p>With Bread Crumbs, you can save destinations that you want to visit later to your phone, by entering their names or selecting a locations on a map. When you are near a saved destination in the future, our app reminds you of your plans, saving you gas, time, and frustration.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Google Maps and Google Places APIs for selecting destinations (via search or on a map) and getting data about distances between destinations. This is an Android app, so through Android Studio we wrote code that could process inputted data and notify users. Additionally, we tried connecting our app with Microsoft's Band, so users can save their current destination to the app through a tile.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team had trouble linking Microsoft's Band with the Android phones we were working with. Since the members of our team hadn't worked with Band before, we had trouble creating a tile on the Band, but were able to receive help from Ryan with Microsoft. Also, working with Google APIs turned out to be more difficult than we had initially thought! As a group of all first time hackathon participants, we had to build our way up from the bottom.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Bread Crumbs</h2>\n<p>This app can be used beyond travel; it can be used for helping compete to do lists efficiently. For instance, if you want  to buy groceries from a certain store during the week, the app could remind you of your plan when you are near that store. Additionally, it could be extended to work with general locations, so, for instance, it could notify you when you pass by any nearby gas station. Specifically, the notification and edit list functions still need to be implemented, but they are close!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/georgesun/breadcrumbs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/georgesun/breadcrumbs\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the design for the app, focusing on user experience and natural mapping.", "I created the initial app and worked on connecting the google maps and google place picker APIs.

I wanted to be able to track any arbitrary object in such a situation, even if it turned, was obscured, or changed.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This program attempts to track an object that is selected on the screen using a box in the center of the image. When specified by the user, it looks at what is inside the box (what is at the center of the image) and tracks the visual pattern as it moves around the screen.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This is built using Python 2.7 and OpenCV. Along with that, NumPy was used for efficient array and image operations.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Optical Frame Tracker</h2>\n<p>The next step is to increase the reliability. Right now, it only matches fixed visual patterns, but if it were able to use updates from what it currently sees and modify its model of the object it's tracking, it would be able to continue tracking it if the object were to change or rotate.</p>\n<h2>Why is it so slow?</h2>\n<p>So many questions! The dot lags behind the object sometimes due to a tradeoff between accuracy and noise reduction. When there is a lot of noise, the found location often jumps around a lot, and so to create smoother tracking, the program makes assumptions about how far the object can move in a given time frame. In cases where the object really does move quickly, it takes some time for the program to realize that this is not just noise and catch up. This is most useful in situations where one doesn't expect things to move too quickly, and would rather have a more stable configuration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Iluvatar/optical_frame_tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Iluvatar/optical_frame_tracker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["PARTY POTATO", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration : We didn't know how to code for databases, now we know a little bit</h2>\n<h2>What it does : Parties</h2>\n<h2>How I built it : With code</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into : Databases</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of : Clicking it alot</h2>\n<h2>What I learned : Databases</h2>\n<h2>What's next for PARTY POTATO : Probably a rave</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://blinding-torch-5531.firebaseapp.com/?\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://blinding-torch-5531.firebaseapp.com/?\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>blinding-torch-5531.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], [" summarize", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Java app that returns summary of website articles (e.g. wikipedia, research journals).</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/danielchawla/summarize\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/danielchawla/summarize\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Da Feelz", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>We wanted to build an app that would give us a good intro to mobile development.</h2>\n<h2>It attempts to change someone's mood based on what they want to feel and what they really feel</h2>\n<h2>We built it through android studio</h2>\n<h2>The challenges that we've faced were mostly aesthetics.

Using the <strong>Bing Search API</strong>, we retrieve and aggregate related articles. We then apply our custom summarization algorithm to the article, allowing us to display the key sentences and sentiments for every article. </p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>Our summarization algorithm uses an extractive method, identifying the top sentences that best summarize a given article. To do this, we compute a  <em>centrality</em> and a <em>relevancy</em> score for every sentence in the file. The relevancy score is a weighted linear combination of various attributes that have been shown, across various studies, to be a good basis for the relevancy of articles. The attributes that we use include key-word frequency, title frequency, document position and sentence length as indicators of relevance.</p>\n<p>We think that the most interesting of these attributes is the frequency score, in which we calculate the sentence-based feature selection score and the density-based feature selection score -- combining the scores to get a relevancy score.</p>\n<p>To calculate the centrality score we create a vertex for every sentence in the article and draw edges between every vector (giving us a complete graph). The weights of the undirected edges are the cosine similarities of the tf-idf vectorizations of the sentences. Given this graph, represented as an adjacency matrix, we then applied Google's <strong>PageRank</strong> algorithm to the matrix, giving us a centrality ranking for every single sentence.</p>\n<p>We then computed the overall score by taking the square root of the product of the centrality score and relevancy score for every sentence. However, getting our summarizing sentences wasn't as simple as just taking the topmost relevancy scores. What we did was apply a maximal marginal relevance selection algorithm, allowing us to ignore redundant sentences while still choosing relevant sentences.</p>\n<p>Our end result was a great number of relevant and interesting summaries. To add to our idea of letting people know what's going on with respect to their favourite topics, we also query relevant Twitter posts. This allows our users to get insight on what others are saying about their interests.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>One big challenge for us was finding an idf (inverse document frequency) score for words. As we don't have massive servers and a great amount of computational power, we needed a way to acquire idf scores efficiently.</p>\n<p>Another problem that we encountered was the fact that the centrality scores (being the result of PageRank) weren't normalized between 0 and 1. This often meant that they were less spread out and had a lesser effect on the overall score than relevancy did. In order to resolve this problem, we needed to normalize the weights between 0 and 1 in such a way that preserves relationships between sentences.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of building a clean, sharp web application that provides contextual and relevant summarizations of recent news articles. We personally designed and developed each one of our methods and had a lot of fun doing so!</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Natural Language Processing, Text Mining and solving difficult problems given unique constraints. We can honestly say that we're leaving this weekend a lot more knowledgeable than we went into it.</p>\n<h2>What's Next For Zero</h2>\n<p>Given that we're relying on Bing News Search to acquire our relevant articles, not everything is in our hands. We're definitely planning on building on this awesome creation and learning about additional options and ways we can find the absolute best articles for readers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-search-api\">bing-search-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scipy\">scipy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pagerank</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lexrank</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tf-idf-vectorization</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cosine-similarities</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/shikib/summarizer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/shikib/summarizer\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Notesi", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notesi \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/430/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notesi \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/431/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notesi \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/433/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notesi \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/452/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notesi \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/453/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Notesi (<code>/no\u028atsi/</code>)</h1>\n<p>Notesi is a service that enables students to upload and share notes for classes and specific lectures.

Thus, our play on sounds conveys the meaning of searching, as one does in a scavenger hunt. </p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of our members recently hosted a scavenger hunt for her class. She had her students explore the campus of the University of Washington, taking pictures of landmarks and locations specified by the hunt. The students posted their images on to a Facebook group page that they used to facilitate events and announcements for their class. The page became cluttered, and it was tedious for our teammate to grade participation and verify the correct target was taken in images. This is where Clarifai and our separate web application came in. Local-do.co is our solution to a photo-based scavenger hunt with verified images and participation.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Local-do.co uses Clarifai to verify images that participants take of their destination by matching tags and defining characteristics specified by the organizer. \nOur users are organizers and participants of scavenger hunts. Organizers have a dashboard that allows them to create new hunts, list their existing ones, and then share with their desired participants. When the participant receives a URL from an organizer, they are prompted to enter their team name. Existing team names will be brought to their dash page, while new teams can start a new dash. As teams explore, on their journey to complete the scavenger hunt, they are able to upload images of their destination to Local-do.co. From there, the image is verified with Clarifai and a response is sent back to the organizer.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Around a whiteboard, with tons of junk food, cans of Arizona tea, and periodical naps. Oh, and collaboration between our five team members, pushing, pulling, and committing to Git. We have a front-end and back-end team, and the occasional straggler who goes between both sides because we desperately need help connecting the two ends. Our web design is a mix of custom stylesheets and Bootstrap. The front and back end are connected through Javascript, with help from jQuery. Data is stored in Firebase.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As first time users of Firebase, the biggest hurdle <strong>by far</strong> was figuring out how to use this exciting new technology.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Having web app that is connected from the front to back end, ready to be used by scavenger hunt lovers of all kinds.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>If you use a new technology, be prepared to underestimate the time needed for the most simple tasks.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Local-Do.co</h2>\n<p>So many things. Refacture the back-end code so that querying data is easier, which will allow us to build more features on top of the existing Local-Do.co. For example, we would have liked to implement a Leaderboard and Livefeed. We also wanted to use the Google Maps API to provide participants with a Google Maps with their path highlighted so they could retrace their epic journey.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://local-do.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://local-do.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>local-do.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Food Lover", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Food Lover \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/344/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Food Lover \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/350/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Food Lover \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/351/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Food Lover \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/911/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Team: FOOD LOVER\nTeam player: \n    Ben Evans\n    Qin Jiang\n    Zhizhen Lin</p>\n<p>Project: transferring images into recipes and listing their calories etc.\nIn this project, we tried to create a simple way to find food and recipe information\ngiven an image of the food.
