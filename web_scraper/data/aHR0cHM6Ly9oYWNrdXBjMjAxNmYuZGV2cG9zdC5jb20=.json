We trained the machine with over 1000 midi files that we got from public libraries. Midi (that's why we are called MIDIocre) is a perfect format because it only saves information about duration and the tone, so it is ideal for training. We used a sequence learning model and a recurrent neural network (first time we heard this terms) because usually neural networks accept a fixed size input, but here we accept a sequence of information (notes). </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was our first time using Flask (not much of a challenge, but still you have to learn something new) but also our first time with TensorFlow. It's been a pain in the ass getting to work with this new thing but it's soooo awesome to see the final songs :D</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to implement a frontend that tells the backend to generate a new song, not impressive at all. But it actually creates a song and it sounds pretty good! (awesome to us, MIDIocre for you, maybe? :D ).</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned Python a bit better (we were more of a javascript guys), we learned Flask (awesome, deffinetly use it more often for hackathons) and most importantly, we learned TensorFlow. Possivilities are endless.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MIDIOCRE</h2>\n<p>We would really love to teach the machine to generate different genres of music. Especcialy \"arcade\" songs like the old Atari, nintendo and other machines used to have. This way game developers wouldn't have to worry about their game's music anymore!

Inspired by PirateBox but build from the ground up by me in a weekend (So it's a lot simpler and hackier, also being a totally different concept).</p>\n<p>My version runs in a MR-3020 router, but it's capable of running in a huge range of hardware, making it Extremely cheap compared with having \"full servers\" or raspberries doing the same job. I think you can get a Librery up and running (acceptably) in a 10\u20ac hardware.</p>\n<p>This point makes really adequate to be used in applications where cost is really important (For example during the refugee humanitarian crisis, where lots of people have internet-capable devices, but no internet and it's difficult to access culture or information, or even places where the internet is censored) </p>\n<p>To use it, you join the network via cable or wifi and connect to any page, (it even works with https pages compared to captive portals that do not! :D). Librery will detect it and redirect you to the Librery itself.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Low memory, unstable firmware, bad connection, the kind of stuff you get when playing with the hardware devil.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was unsure that I could do it, but I did! this is my first solo hack, and it has been a grat experience.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Routers are cool and powerful, memory is super valuable. You don't want to mess too much with software that can brick your hardware.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Librery</h2>\n<p>It would be super cool to add meshing abilities so routers can propagate books between them, this could be very useful to distribute information in places where no internet is available.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">openwrt</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["ImaTake", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ImaTake \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/772/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Image selection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ImaTake \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/773/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Blur detection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ImaTake \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/774/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Orientation detection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ImaTake \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/883/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Bad expossition detection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ImaTake \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/884/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Noise detection</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When you return from a trip, you usually have a lot of repeated photos.

The main application detects similar images and discards the worse ones based on the features above.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The design of every feature was a big challenge as it required some advanced signal processing concepts.

Our passion is to visualize data and transform it into useful information. So, when we saw the GFT challenge, we choose it without blinking; we really wanted to use the 10GB of data provided and take advantage of it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a heat map of transactions made by clients of a Bank (HackUPC '16), data provided by GFT. It consists of a Web application that allows the user to enter an interval of age, average salary and situation; in order to search the best commercial areas that suits their requirements based on previous transactions. So, for example, a mid-aged man that is a father can see where people like him spend their money. It is not only useful for customers, but also for the Bank itself, as it can analyze on which area their clients spend more money based on their features, therefore optimizing aspects such as advertisement, or placing ATMs.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the system only with our laptops, using Sublime Text and Vi. We use spaces over indentations.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The most difficult challenge was to deal whit the big quantity of data, as it was slow and very demanding. Other challenge was to find a proper visualization for the data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the processement speed reached after several optimization processes. Our system can process GBs of data even in less than a second, making the system very fast and usable. This, along the developed map makes the web a very friendly application.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We've deepen our knowledge on how to process big quantities of data using MongoDB and NodeJS. Also, we've learnt how to develop heat maps, and how to work in a very stressful ambient.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Stores for Me!</h2>\n<p>Next step is to integrate Barcelona Open Data to show data about stores, markets and businesses (for example, to show that data in the heatmap or a list of more popular markets according to customer features). The program is modular so it can be easily extended.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/piraces/stores4me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/piraces/stores4me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was the responsible for the backend part.

Noone realized it until the next morning. All those hours of pain could have been avoided, and we wanted to be the ones to create the tools in order to do so.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By installing a set of cheap sensors all arround the house we can harvest real time data. This data produced by the sensors is sent by a RaspberryPi to a server using the Opentrends API. \nObtaining all this data could be very intrusive. Therefore, we created the Android App in such a way that the end user can not acces any specific data. Instead he gets a general \"Safety Indicator\". \nThis Safety Indicator, normally in color green, turns orange or red depending on the situation.</p>\n<p>An orange indicator turns on a buzzer in the house. Stoping this buzzer pressing a button resets the Stafety indicator to green. Not stoping the buzzer turns the indicator to red and alerts the end user. A buzzer still sounding with a red indicator calls the ambulance after a while.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We conected a set of sensors to a Raspberry-PI which using the Opentrends API we conected to a server. \nEach interaction sends data (json format) to the server. \nOnce in the server an Android App in your phone requests the data and decides whether everything is okay or not.\nThe sensors used were: Pressure sensor, Switch sensor, Red Button to stop the Buzzer, Rotary Angle Sensor (Grove Component) and a Buzzer (also Grove Component). In addition, the RaspberryPi sends periodic pings to the server, in order to check the absence of any malfunction.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A few hours lost trying to make work or definitely broken WiFi adaptor.\nProblems with the json format and the software versions in the RaspberryPi.\nBuzzers just didn't want to work at the begining. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Everything works!

After 8 hours of exhausting work, you look through the window and realize it\u2019s starting to rain. You feel kind of sad, as you won\u2019t be able to do what you planned for the afternoon, but the sound of rain is kind of relaxing and the bitterness is replaced by a feeling of relaxed happiness. But suddenly a thought flashes through your mind that makes you go mad: as always, you left your umbrella home.</p>\n<p>The idea was simple. We just wanted to create the unforgettable umbrella, an item you could impossibly leave home when you\u2019ll need it. So AYA was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>AYA\u2019s fancy notification LEDs remind you to take the umbrella in case the weather forecast for the next 10 hours reports probable rainfalls. AYA\u2019s LEDs only light up in case you are close. A Raspberry Pi attached to the umbrella is synched to your Smartphone via Bluetooth and infers proximity based on signal strength.</p>\n<p>In case you ignore AYA and leave home without the umbrealla when the forecast probable rain during the next hours, you\u2019ll receive two extra shots: 1) A notification in your Pebble Smart Watch and 2) a call in your smartphone that will remind you about it with a robotic voice: \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s going to rain\u2026\u201d</p>\n<p>You can use AYA\u2019s app on your smartphone to choose what type of notifications you want to activate (LEDs, Pebble and/or Smartphone call).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We screwed a Raspberry Pi to the handle of a regular wooden umbrella and connected its pins to a series of LEDs (we went for a parallel connection to make light effects possible and identify points of failure).\nWe call a weather API from the Raspberry to know if it\u2019s going to rain in the next 10 hours.\nThe Raspberry Pi is paired to a mobile app via Bluetooth. The signal strength emitted by the smartphone is measured by the Raspberry. When signal strength reaches a certain threshold level (meaning the owner is close to the umbrella), the LED notifications light up (only in a scenario when rain is forecasted).</p>\n<p>If the owner ignores the LED notifications and leaves home without the umbrella, he will receive a notification in his Pebble Smart Watch and ultimately a phone call letting him know.</p>\n<p>You can switch AYA on and off through the mobile app, as also choosing what notifications do you want to activate (LEDs, Pebble and/or phone call).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>  Complex product \u201cdesign\u201d associated to physical products.</li>\n<li>  Bluetooth communication</li>\n<li>  Bluetooth signal strength detection for distance inference</li>\n<li>  Twilio integration</li>\n<li>  Electronics and circuitery, a lot of welding</li>\n<li>  First time using Raspberry</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of having completed the project. Building a physical product has been a real challenge and almproducing it almost as we envisioned it\u2019s been a great pleasure. Also, we are proud to have done it while being the first Hackathon for Ricard. He is a non-programmer and has helped with product design, circuitery and (Yay!) his firsts lines of code.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We would like to work with a product designer who can come up with a professional design for the product to make it safer and better looking.

Our app can do this for you - it finds the cheapest route that visits all the cities that you wish to visit, gives you several days to spend in each and organizes everything for you. </p>\n<h2>Skyscanner API</h2>\n<p>You might think that the cheapest option is to always travel to the next closest city, but in fact ticket prices vary a lot and it is often the case that it is much cheaper to visit your destinations in a different order and thus save significant amounts. Of course, nobody has time to do all this planning manually, so that's why we're using the Skyscanner API to compute the best and cheapest combinations of flights on our custom backend.</p>\n<h2>Twilio API</h2>\n<p>When you finally have all your travel sorted, it might still happen that you visit a country and get lost with no Wi-Fi and limited (or very expensive) data-connection options. That's why we also implemented a service that enables you to send a single SMS with your current GPS location and receive a simple map of the surrounding area - completely offline, no data connection needed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The mobile app is built for Android. It communicates with Skyscanner API, uses SMS to communicate with Twilio and also talks to our own custom backend which handles the heavy computations and data processing. This allows the interface between the app and the backend to be clean and maintainable.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The most difficult part was implementing the routing algorithm that finds the optimal combinations of flights for the trip. We had to think about different ways to handle dates, prices, and various travel paths that one could take.\nFor the Twilio part, we ran into problems with SMS size limitations but we eventually managed to send and assemble data by splitting it into several messages sent to the device independently.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Skyscanner Rountrip</h2>\n<p>We would like to continue to get user feedback and improve the experience of the app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/skyscanner\">skyscanner</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">scikit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cv2</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend and implemented the flight routing algorithm that finds the cheapest flight combinations.", "I worked on the Android apps", ""]], ["Where I go?", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Where I go? \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/789/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Where I go? \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/787/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>WHERE I GO?</h1>\n<p>Where I go will help you taking decisions about your next flight corresponding to your weather preferences.</p>\n<p>It is an Android application that uses the SkyScanner API, to get the available flights and combine this data with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide the weather information about your next destination.</p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>More accurated travel details.</li>\n<li>Link flight details to the corresponding official website.</li>\n<li>Social media integration.</li>\n<li>Add AI depending on your past experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/skyscanner\">skyscanner</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/openweathermap\">openweathermap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LaQuay/HackUPCFall2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LaQuay/HackUPCFall2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Tight!

Also, the comparators we found didn't take into account the cost of accomodation and food in the destinations, which we found essential in our search, as we are students and track every last pennie!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This code provides the user with an easy interface that allows them to choose the following parameters: city of origin, city(cities) of destination, dates in between which you can travel, number of days you want to stay abroad, number of travellers and maximum budget. The application returns different combinations of flights and hotels, taking into account the cost of living. They are ordered according to your preferences (if the user provides an ordered list of destinations)  and always fit your budgets. The applications shows by default only three results, but the users are able to continue looking into the possibilities for the same city or skip to the next destination of their choice.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use Skyscanner's API to browse the cach\u00e9 flights and thus provide a quicker answer. However, given that there's no API to do the equivalent for Hotels, we are forced to do a live search everytime for that part. The core of the algorithm is coded in python and html is used to interact with the users.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As newbies we had challenges practically every step of the way. The main challenges were finding databases to provide the cost of living of each country and ensembling python with html, a language we hadn't use before. Speed was also a critical point at our project, as the algorithm performes too slowly. A few changes were introduced, but it still reminds one of the main problems.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Just before starting the project we barely knew what APIs were, so getting acquainted with them and how to use and implement them is something we are very proud of. We're very happy with the result of our very first web-page and its beautiful interface, but especially of getting html to work!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tight! Budget</h2>\n<p>We believe that Tight! Budget has a place in the market. It gives people the power to get the best combinations without having to pay to third parties. Also, there is great room for improvement: from getting bigger databases to compare more prices to extend to other areas related to travelling. It is the ultimate app to help you decide where and when to go  with a limited budget.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/saugch/HackUPC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/saugch/HackUPC\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Altran HackUPC Challenge", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Altran HackUPC Challenge \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/732/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>PCA</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Altran HackUPC Challenge \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/812/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>path analysis</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Altran HackUPC Challenge \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/813/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>path analysis</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Altran HackUPC Challenge \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/838/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>tableau</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Altran HackUPC Challenge \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/844/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>coverage evolution</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by our teachers and mentors at HackUPC. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We have done the data analysis and built dashboards on Altran coverage data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Statistical Modelling</li>\n<li>Route trajectory</li>\n<li>Principle Component Analysis </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We used Python, R for statistical and data analysis.

Even though for us it is very simple to use and straight forward, our parents find difficult to use this awesome search engine. We tried to make the process of searching much easier, translating the natural processing language into information used by Skyscanner API to find the best 3 options. It is also a way for persons with disabilities to use Skyscanner, through our voice recognition and voice response functions. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The customer start a conversation with the bot by telling the departure city, the destination and the period of travelling. For example, if a client says \"I want to travel from London to Barcelona from 6th of October to 9th of October 2016.\" Obviously, this example is not enough in order to complete a flight search. As a result, our bot start a conversation with the client, in order to fill all the information required, such as number of people flying and currency used. After a short interaction between the bot and the client, you can complete the booking process on Skyscanner. It is free for all Skyscanner users. \nFurthermore, we added a voice recognition function, in order to be more user-friendly or more suitable for persons with disabilities. In this case, the interaction between the bot and client will be made verbally. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The front-end is constructed with Bootstrap, using html, css and js. The backend uses Rosetta API, in order to \"decode\" the natural language and to recognise key words, such as the outbound and inbound date and the locations. All these information are integrated with the Skyscanner API, in order to find the best 3 options available at the moment of search. We used python for this part. Furthermore, the data is transmitted cross-domain using heroku, flask and python through a XML HTTP request.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>What to start with - initially it was quite hard to find a way to create the solution and we had to brainstorm different ways of </li>\n<li>Lack of information - Razvan is the only one who knew to work with heroku and servers. As a result, for the rest of us was challenging to understand the code and how to create our codes, such that everything to match. He also met lots of difficulties creating only for the second time a server. Oana and Cristian were the one in charge with the backend and with understanding the Skyscanner API and implementing the NLP software. For Ana, this was her second hackathon and considering the fact that she has an Economics background, was quite challenging to learn as much as possible in such a limited time. </li>\n<li>Lack of experience - we all 4 have a limited experience and was difficult to understand bits of code and how to integrate the API. </li>\n<li>Tiredness - well, we all traveled from London on Friday morning and woke up at 3am. As a result, it was a bit challenging for us to meet all our goals, with only some hours of sleep during those 3 nights. </li>\n<li>Health - we do not know how, but all 4 of us caught a cold during our stay in Barcelona. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Well, first of all, one hour before the deadline we had a huge list of errors and our biggest accomplishment is that our web application at least run! Second of all, learning so many things in such a limited amount of time was another accomplishment, especially because we set high goals as a team. We also had a bit of time to implement the speech recognition and voice response, which helped us focus also on the social impact of the application. As a result, we are really proud of this implementation. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Razvan: \"I learnt a lot more about servers! I spent more than 9 hours building our HTTP requests and debugging the program. Furthermore, I learnt how to work faster and more accurate. Because I was the one in charged with the Control part, I had to combine all 4 codes in the last few hours and together to debug the application - thing which, believe me, it's quite challenging and stressful.\"\nOana &amp; Cristian: \"We worked together for the backend, using the four APIs: two from Skyscanner, Rosetta and an IP recognition API. As a result, we had to get through thousands of lines of code and to find the most efficient solutions for our problem. I do believe that the main thing we learnt from this experience was to debug quickly and to write more clearly, in order to understand what we have done and how to use our code.\" \nAna: \"Well, this was the second time I have ever coded, so, it was quite challenging for me to construct the website and to learn as much as possible from my colleagues. It is self explanatory that 90% of what I have done those 36 hours I learnt on the spot: basics of html, css, js and how to build a website from the scratch.\" </p>\n<h2>What's next for SkyscannerPlus.tech</h2>\n<p>Making the code more efficient and solving the server problems will be the next step. Furthermore, we are aware that we missed many types of interaction in our code and we have to develop it. We also have to learn more about speak recognition softwares and how to make a greater use of them. Taking into consideration that all 4 of us are from London and that we are really good friends, we would like to improve the application and even to make it public in the near future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/skyscanner\">skyscanner</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.tech</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">speak-recognition</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://skyscannerplus.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://skyscannerplus.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>skyscannerplus.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/razvangeangu/skyscannerplus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/razvangeangu/skyscannerplus\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["HitchhikingApp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bm7tEGTd9ds?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>After hitchiking all around Europe and other parts of the world, Diana realized that the hitchiking community is ready to enter the wonderful world of tecnology!

Since all clients know the starting position, speed and direction of the bullet, they can calculate their absolute position at all times and ensure that everybody sees the exact same thing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Making it work </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We'd never used socket.io before or implemented any real-time synchronization.\nCanvas and the library we used was challenging to us, first time doing low-level graphics.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Omazing</h2>\n<p>Add more layers with increasing difficulty so that the first to reach 1000th floot wins.\nImplement team management to cooperate with friends</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">easeljs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/canvas\">canvas</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Kyezil/omazing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Kyezil/omazing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["King of Telegram", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"King of Telegram \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/147/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Game Interaction</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"King of Telegram \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/156/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Roll the dice!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"King of Telegram \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/157/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>In chat custom keyboard!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We usually hang out with our friends in a drink &amp; games bar where you can get fun while you play your favourite table games with your friends.

So what if anybody can do the same with only a little effort? Maybe the playlist you build could be astonishing and you will be the next DJ in Tomorrowland!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It does two things.</p>\n<p>The first one is <strong>helping you to find great playlists</strong> that already exists and If you want to follow them you can directly from the app.</p>\n<p>The second one is helping you to <strong>create awesome playlists</strong> based on the playlists you love. We've build a bot that do the hard work for you. So this is the idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You create a new playlist or use an existing one.</li>\n<li>You add feeding to this playlist with the playlists you love (in our app).</li>\n<li>Once you have some playlists you thing that are great, the bot will copy them to your own playlist every 5 minutes. In other words, each time that a playlist you love adds a song, it will be automatically added to your playlist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why this will help me? Because you will be able to delete the songs you don't like and the bot will add every song you may love because of the other playlists.</p>\n<p>This will save you a lot of time to create your best playlist ever and share it in the social media!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>With a lot of love &lt;3 . It's done with Ionic, so it will be compatible with iPhone and Android.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning some angular 2 and a lot of wasted hours to have the Spotify login working. Finally, build a working app in some hours.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>That the app is working and will be nearly on the App Store and Play Store because it works and it hasn't things hardcoded :)</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to use the API of Spotify and that it's possible to build a working awesome app in a few hours.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Playlists Premium for Spotify</h2>\n<p>Be on the App Store and Play Store and arrive to the top apps over this year, reaching at least 100.000 downloads!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"

Because we could publish it and host it on GitHub, everything related to the server-side turned from \"we have no idea at all\" to \"easy peasy\".</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The SkyScanner API. One hell of a challenge. We thought it would be easier to use than it actually is, and we found lots of trouble to make it work. In the end, we used a pre-baked solution that bypasses the API that, while it works, it's not 100% correct (no updates). In fact, you can only check it from Barcelona, Austin (TX) and London... for now.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Well, we didn't quit, and we ended up publishing it!

It's a problem, then we understood that was time to evolve and we started to ask \"something that the user always have\", for example a bank token or an OTP generator, but these devices are not user friendly and I often lose them.</p>\n<p>We need to change the paradigm, instead of asking something \"I know\" or something that \"is in my possession\" we want to use a trusted smartphone that is always with the final user and in a transparent and automatic way we query its position and see if the user is authorized to authenticate from that position, for example you want to withdraw money from an ATM, then we verify that you are really in front of the ATM and not someone else who cloned your credit card, we think this approach is better in so many levels that this model will become the standard in future.</p>\n<p>A smartphone is the authentication box where we can make all the tests that we need for our scope, we can ask for confirmation or notify the user, we can query location requests (GPS / Galileo / GLONASS / Compass-Beidou), and use other geolocation options as fail over for example we can query the GSM position (HLR / VLR / SGSN) and in exceptional cases we can use biometrics and more, basically a smartphone today is capable to do everything that we need to authenticate someone!</p>\n<p>AuthLand aim to become a third entity that verify the identity of the user testing if meets all the parameters requested for authorization, using the last example if I withdraw from an ATM the backend of the bank application query our API to calculate a trust score using the app that is installed in the customer's phone and we verify that the user is physically near to the ATM, the device's GPS answer with the results, and using this data we can approve or negate the authentication, if the user is paranoid he can request that AuthLand shows a prompt to confirm what he is doing or perform a biometric verification (Ex. new Samsung's tablets came with retina and fingerprint readers), the user is free to set the value of its trust score to authorize its authentication for every identity.</p>\n<p>The business model is simple, those who want to integrate our solution into their backend (using our API) pay a monthly fee per user to protect their customers. This is an authentication as a service startup, we will provide simple APIs that will simplify the life of the developer and will help avoid potential fraud among their users.</p>\n<p>What are doing other players in the authentication sector? MasterCard ask to make a \"selfie pay\" to verify the intention of the user, we think this won't work because the final user is lazy, solutions must be transparent, like a magic trick, also in the Google I/O was introduced Abacus AKA Trust API a Google project that makes behavior profiling for authentication purposes, they get all my data, where I go, what I buy and everything and based on this data the system understand when something is wrong, AuthLand respect your privacy and let you choose the level of trustness of your score.</p>\n<p>AuthLand is an outsourced service that uses GNSS to authenticate the final user in any kind login scheme that support our API, with AuthLand your smartphone becomes your key manager but only works if you are in right place at the right moment!</p>\n<p>AuthLand: Authentication as a Service!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sentil</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://authland.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://authland.tech/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>authland.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rgalarcia/AuthlandAPP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rgalarcia/AuthlandAPP\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Cellphone signal warning", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cellphone signal warning \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/982/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Bad signal warning</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cellphone signal warning \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/983/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Good signal</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Alessio talks, on the phone, with his dad when he is on the road (which is a lot).

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Big data is a hot topic but we'd never attempted it before. When the opportunity to analyse millions of mobile phone users data came up we leapt to the challenge. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We managed to analyse <strong>2GB</strong> of users data, in <strong>PYTHON</strong> on a <strong>LAPTOP</strong>.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We decided that the best idea would be to try this analysis in python, since we haven't done anything like it before. We loaded the CSVs using and optimised, customised data structure. We then tested various hypotheses on the raw data and managed to learn a lot about these users.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Python's ram usage, peak was over 9,000MB. We managed to halve the memory usage which enabled us to extract twice as many samples from the dataset.</p>\n<h2>Cool stuff we found</h2>\n<p>People in the west of the country stayed up later and got up later than users in the east. There was a local minimum in the speed distribution at each speed limit (so they're either just under or over the limit). Some people just want to watch the world burn and break my graphs by going at 300 km/h. People like to club at night, meaning that their GPS signals are lower.</p>\n<p>The most common times for these users was at 11am (coffee break) and 5pm (when they get out of work.)\nThe most common day for data was the 5th of the month. Roughly twice as much data than any other day of the month. Possibly a sampling issue in the original data?</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>19,290,818. That's how many records we were analysing. This was on a laptop, in Python, by two men who'd never done big data analysis.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to analyse several GB of raw data and find trends in such a large dataset. We learned how to do so in an \"\"\"efficient\"\"\"\" fashion. Big data in Python. Git/github.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ACCD</h2>\n<p>Feed us more data, and see what we find out!</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Thanks to Altran for providing us with the data.\nThanks to UPC for hosting such an awesome hackathon and the organisers for being awesome.\nA shout out to the wifi, which always showed up when I needed it.\nThanks to all the sponsors for all their support (Skyscanner, you guys are code ninjas.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">matplotlib</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jupyter</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ingenuity</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tenacity</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">coffee</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">classes</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RichardoC/ACCD/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/RichardoC/ACCD/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was the main code monkey, trying to use some skills from a Java analysis course in Python.", "I used pandas to analyze the correlation between some variables like carrier, time of the day and signal."]], ["Set Your City on Fire", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Set Your City on Fire \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/641/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the opportunity provided by opentrends to work with sentilo, an open source IoT platform that allows us to work real information collected by multiple sensors, we were able to identify one of the biggest problems with living in the city, security.\nSo, our main focus with this project was to identify possible risks thanks to the data provided by a diverse variety of sensors and analyze it in order to generate safe and unsafe zones, to do so.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The aim of the project was to question whether open data sets could be utilised for a bad cause.

The purpose is to make learning more fun because of the <strong>interaction with strangers</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Dance the Cha Cha Chat</strong> is a chatting website specialized in learning languages. It connects two people interested in learning the <strong>same language</strong> or the one spoken by the other one and lets them chat for <strong>an agreed time</strong> about a <strong>specific topic</strong>.

Due to a lack of combinations, the manufacturers also reuse the same locks in different parts of the world, meaning that totally unrelated people from different parts of the globe may have the same keys!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Lockpik totally relies on people posting the codes and locations of locks. This is potentially the biggest downfall, but whatever.

It turned out that this already existed, so the project was turned in another direction. More specifically towards Batman. Wanting to stay in the realm of audio based systems we decided to see whether it would be possible to create something similar to what is used by Batman in the movie The Dark Knight. And thus Soundscape was born!</p>\n<p>Soundscape works by emitting high frequency audio chirps from the loud speakers on your phone or laptop. These sound waves then bounce around the environment and some of them eventually make it back to the emitter. By detecting when these returning chirps arrive distances to the environment can be determined and space can be mapped.</p>\n<p>The project is built using java script which means that it runs on basically any device that has a loudspeaker and a microphone. Furthermore, by storing the software on a web server it is accessible from ordinary web browsers without the need for any additional installs.</p>\n<p>Having little to no prior experience with java script made the project quite the challenge. Especially the audio generation and recording part. The fact that speakers generally are designed to be as omni-directional as possible makes it difficult to get distance measurements as the chirps bounce around all over the place. Thus, the project as it stands is of limited use, however, the software part of it works as it should and the only real limitation is the hardware.</p>\n<p>This, we think is pretty cool, given how foreign java script was to us!</p>\n<p>The long term goal for Soundscape is to create a system capable of 3D mapping environments using smartphones similar to what Batman does in The Dark Knight movie. Naturally, the quality witnessed in the movie will be nigh impossible to achieve, but decent imaging should be doable if multiple transceivers are utilized.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://dragonturtle.dk/HackUPC/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dragonturtle.dk/HackUPC/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>dragonturtle.dk</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jpbreuer/hackupc16f_soundscape\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jpbreuer/hackupc16f_soundscape\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Huyendo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Huyendo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/539/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Huyendo \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/537/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Huyendo \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/538/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Huyendo \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/882/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Visiting cities has become much cheaper with the booming market in budget airlines and a flexible traveller is sure to find a route which saves their money to enjoy the world.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Huyendo allows a traveller to choose the cities they want to visit and how long they want to stay in each place.

The app consists in a simple full screen that changes its color depending on the sequence the administrator has decided. In a simple phone it can sound a bit silly, but imagine 90.000 phones connected and synchronized in macro events like a football match, all forming the badge of a team or helping creating incredible light effects for a band clip.\nFrom a key provided by the administrator or the responsible organization, all the users can get into the network and use their screens to \"shine it\".</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The team is formed by 4 members: Pol, Biel, Jordi and Joan.</p>\n<p>Both Biel and Jordi have worked in the backend of this project using mainly Java and Spring, and Pol and Joan together worked in the front end of the app using XML.</p>\n<p>The rights of all the images of this app are reserved.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>In the front end part, both programmers agree that the main challenge has been to face a new code language, but we have learned a looot from the android world.</p>\n<p>Our two backend beasts tell us that the main problem they have faced is to establish a synchronization between two different phones with different clocks (seems easy...).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The accomplishment we're more proud of is that it works. Counting that we start working Saturday at 6 pm, we have reached the hack in a record time enjoying every second of it.</p>\n<p>Project developed and enjoyed by the 4 of us.</p>\n<p>WeShineIT.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spring\">spring</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/biels/GFIChallenge\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/biels/GFIChallenge\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/biels/GFIChallengeServer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/biels/GFIChallengeServer\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/y62ucof4mtp58c6/app-release-unsigned.apk?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/y62ucof4mtp58c6/app-release-unsigned.apk?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front-End and Design contributor at the WeShineIT Project", "Application logic (Android, Java)", "Created backend, api and api client", ""]]]
