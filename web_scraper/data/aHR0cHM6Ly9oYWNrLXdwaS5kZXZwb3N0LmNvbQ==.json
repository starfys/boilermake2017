We were looking into creating an auto shutoff module that could be integrated into existing stoves to prevent house fires. Eventually we decided to focus on making daily life more convenient, and doing so with a fun, over engineered design. After several hours of discussion, we developed an integrated dental hygiene concept for household use. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>T\u00fcth is an all-in-one, internet-enabled solution for the future of dental hygiene. It holds multiple toothbrushes in a UV sanitation bay. It automatically dispenses the perfect amount of tooth paste and mouthwash with its automated dispensing systems. It offers an integrated audio timer and responsive illumination system which is used to give the user feedback on their brushing time and ensure that they brush and mouthwash for the dentist-recommended time. The system supports the extension of multiple user profiles, enabling the system to tailor its dispersal amounts based on which toothbrush is picked up. The internet capability keeps the users accountable for their brushing habits. If one of the users forgets to brush a particular morning or night, it will post to their Twitter account, notifying the world that they forgot to brush their teeth --public shaming at its finest.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The T\u00fcth system was originally built using the Particle Photon board, providing wireless internet and easy access to web API's. During a momentary lapse of judgement in our sleep deprived state, we accidentally pumped 12v through the 5v board VIN pin, and that was the end of the Photon. Such is life. We ported the whole thing over to an Arduino Mega and wrote a Processing script on a laptop to rebuilt the twitter functionality.</p>\n<p>We had some servos and acrylic lying around and we scavenged for most of the other parts. We used a water bottle, pieces of scrap wood, and a lot of hot glue.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was surprisingly hard to use a servo to control the mouthwash. We were too cheap to buy a real valve so we spent hours trying to design a way to crimp a tube to stop the flow.</p>\n<p>The Photon burnout cost us a tremendous amount of time in redesigning the electrical system and porting the code over.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The design prototype is fairly attractive considering how quickly it was put together.\nWe had a ton of fun making it, and are glad we picked a fun project to work on.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>It is incredibly rewarding to over-engineer a simple everyday task and apply the internet of things to ridiculous objects. </p>\n<h2>What's next for T\u00fcth</h2>\n<p>We've started prototyping a website interface that will hopefully allow users to track their brushing history. We also have a pico projector that we want to add to internally-project to the user a random YouTube video to keep them entertained.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">particle-photon</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I wrote the embedded software to control the hardware and the web functionality.", "", "", "", ""]], ["Unorganizr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Unorganizr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/335/722/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Room Already Taken</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Unorganizr \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/335/723/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Initial View</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Unorganizr \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/335/724/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Intro Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The many times I forgot to book a room for my group meeting and spent hours searching for an open room on campus by walking through each building.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It parses through 25live to gather scheduling information for WPI events and classes.

It then displays the location of open and taken classrooms on Bing maps using openlayers to overlay location markers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some of the challenges we ran into were gathering location data for rooms across WPI campus. In addition, we had to deal with inconsistencies between 25live and the actual WPI campus. Another challenge was parsing data from 25live. Different xml namespaces made it tricky to pull down the data and easily parse it into a readable form. The final and possibly biggest challenge was overlaying. A lot of the locations had to be offset and correctly rotated, so that they would overlay nicely on the map.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting data from 25live. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot during this project.

While you're online, CopyCast will record HTTP requests to media, and allow you through a Browser Action dialog to send them to your Chromecast.</p>\n<p>Content behind proprietary players (Adobe Flash, JWPlayer, etc) are all now castable! </p>\n<h1>It Does FLV Video!</h1>\n<p>There are a few extensions similar to CopyCast already on the market, but none of them are able to cast FLV because the Chromecast can not run it. CopyCast is able to play <em><em>most</em></em> FLV videos on popular sites to get content onto your TV ASAP.</p>\n<h2>How Does it Cast FLV?!?!</h2>\n<p>Originally, I was toying with a client side ASM.js build of <code>ffmpeg</code> to convert FLV videos on the fly (client side via a web worker) into mp4. This is technically feasible, however it was slow and defeated the entire point of CopyCast.</p>\n<p><strong><em>So instead</em></strong>, CopyCast has an easy option to temporarilly spoof Chrome's User Agent on all outgoing HTTP requests to look like they were coming from an iPhone. For most sites that serve two primary things: television and advertisements, pretending to be a mobile user to grab the mp4 you want to cast works just fine :)</p>\n<p>Most TV/Movie based streaming sites that serve FLV <strong><em>also</em></strong> serve mp4 if you ask them nice enough. This weird duality most likely can be attributed to the fact that mobile operating systems like iOS are much more locked down so even if a user is given an mp4 there's little the user could do short of watching it and moving along -- <em>not anymore!</em></p>\n<h2>What Tech Did I Use (for HackWPI)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Chrome APIs \n\n<ul>\n<li> <code>chrome.webRequest</code></li>\n<li> <code>chrome.webNavigation</code></li>\n<li> <code>chrome.tabs</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Chromecast Library: <code>chrome.cast</code></li>\n<li>Bootstrap</li>\n<li>jQuery</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future Plans</h2>\n<p>This was a really fun project! In the near future I intend to further polish the UI and clean up and test more things that I didn't have the luxury to bother with during the context of a Hackathon. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local Storage API - leveraging <code>chrome.storage</code> to persist data between sessions and even instances of your google account across Chrome Browsers would be really nice.\n\n<ul>\n<li>This would also pave the way to features such as playlists, exporting, sharing, etc. </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Ideally, I'd ditch the whole approach with the user agent spoofing.

One of our team members had a coach in high school who asked for an easier way to build lineups, preferably through technology. Her coach used to use popsicle sticks with magnets to figure out lineups. This application will take less time and it will be easier to determine which athlete is already in a boat, and which ones need to be added to a boat. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This application allows coaches to register their teams and rosters, which eventually allows them to have a detailed user interface of a boat that they can choose (we have three different boats that have 8 seats). They will have oars (starboard and port - the two sides that rowers can be) as well as a microphone that represents the coxswain (there is one coxswain per boat). The coaches can then drag and drop each oar (that has each rowers name on it) onto a boat that is in the middle of the screen. One feature that it has is that it will grey out an oar if it is selected and dragged into a boat. This allows the coach to know which athletes are already selected to be in a boat.   </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used android studio, with java, xml, and photoshop (creating visuals) to build this application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Some challenges we ran into were that none of us were extremely familiar with android studio, so it took more time to resolve errors and it took a while for our github to work.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We overcame many different challenges, while every group member had a different strengths and different backgrounds (two CS majors, one MIS major).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to build an android application from scratch!</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Perfect Lineup</h2>\n<p>We would like to eventually make it available for all sports, this would be a great tool for every sports coach to use!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/maryannoconnell/the-perfect-lineup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/maryannoconnell/the-perfect-lineup\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Dance_your_tune", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dance_your_tune \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/338/418/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The team aspired to build a dance system which would recognize movements and accordingly create lighting and music. This would encourage the user to dance freely, and not have to worry about following a tune or the lighting patterns. This idea was born from the team's wild dancing spirit.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>1) Music: Based on Roll, Yaw, and Pitch, the tunes are adjusted for the user. This allows the users expression in the form of dance to create corresponding music. This tool could also be used by music composers to develop melodies.</p>\n<p>2) Lighting: Based on gestures, different lighting patterns (and animations), are developed. This allows the user to change the ambiance and focus to optimize the effect of dance moves.</p>\n<p>3) Vibrations: A system with multiple vibrators is controlled based on gestures, which could allow coordination of dance moves. This can be used beyond the domain of dance, in sports, and other domains of coordination. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>1) Music: Inputs from Myo Armband were passed to garage band (using midi and lua script) to control instruments through software input.</p>\n<p>2) Lighting: An LED (RGB) strip was controlled using Arduino. The input to this system was gestures from the Myo Armband. The Arduino was used to create patterns and animations in response to gestures.</p>\n<p>3) Vibrations: Vibrators attached to MOSFETS were used to create vibrations whenever gestures were observed from the Arduino.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>1) Using Midi to input music to GarageBand\n2) Using Myo Armband, which wasn't as stable as expected\n3) Finding a solution to Armband's locking systems. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>1) Creating a complete music, dance and lighting systems\n2) Achieving coordination\n3) Using a homemade power supply</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>1) Lua scripting\n2) Using Windows 8\n3) Operating animations on LED strip</p>\n<h2>What's next for Dance_your_tune</h2>\n<p>1) Visual processing to coordinate dance and make better dance systems</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">motor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mac\">mac</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-8\">windows-8</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">armband</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">power-supply-(home-made)</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">leds</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/midi-js\">midi.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vibrators</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["AccelScreen", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>AccelScreen uses the sensor fusion built into your Android device to combine measurements from your accelerometer, gyrometer, magnometer, and other sensors to build a high quality model of where it is located in space.

If they want to participate in the challenge, they should start completing one challenge every day and the challenges are going to be something like: Take video of pranking your friends, Take a picture with a stranger on the subway and so on... </p>\n<p>It would make the social networking website so much fun and after 100 days they would receive a legit video of all the things they did in 100 days so they would have the memories that are captured digitally and maybe someone who has done best in the challenge would receive some kind of gift too after 100 days.</p>\n<p>I have not planned it out yet all, because social network is kind of project that develops and develops all the time.

Users will be able to browse the built in \"package store\" and download their own adventures. Each package will have a set of locations that the user must reach. How the package takes you there, however, is up to its creator. The package could take you and your friends on a sightseeing tour, it could take you and your class on a educational trip, or it could take you and your date on a romantic hide and seek journey through a big city. The package will tell you where to start and then it will guide you from checkpoint to checkpoint. For example, maybe you want to learn about the history of Worcester. Simply download an educational package centered around Worcester and the app will take you on a tour, telling you where to go, then pausing at each predefined landmark to explain what you are looking at. Another example of possible use is during NSO at WPI. WPI would create a free package that would guide you throughout the entire campus, stopping you in front of certain buildings to explain what they are and what their significance is. Lastly, and perhaps my favorite example, Trivia Tour can make for a perfect first date. A package creator can lead a couple on a romantic scavenger hunt date. At each stop they receive a clue so that they must work together and use to find the next stop.</p>\n<p>More technical parts / about the app:\nSo the obvious question now is: where are all these \"packages\" coming from? Well, the packages can be created by anyone! Anyone can become a developer and design their own unique packages with as many stops, clues, and hints as they like! This feature is actually mostly functioning and can be at tested (very beta, don't judge!) at <a href=\"http://users.wpi.edu/%7Ejtfakult/public/TriviaTour/create_package/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://users.wpi.edu/~jtfakult/public/TriviaTour/create_package/</a>. All created packages will be downloaded formatted as a json. The user then only has to upload the file to the server where it will be encrypted, modified and polished until it's sparkly clean and ready to enter the package store. The app itself is already able to connect to the server and download packages. However, the search functionality of the store is not yet completed, so browsing isn't possible. There is still a lot of work to be done, but the more I work, the more gems I find hidden within the idea.</p>\n<p>Why did I make it?\nTwo reasons. First, I want people to have another fun game that they can play. But unlike many, this game is interactive. It causes them to think, learn, laugh, and even go outside and exercise. Second, I want people to share their cool ideas, pictures, riddles, and maybe their secret romantic side. I want the developers to have just as much fun with the app as the users. I want developers to also be users, and users to also be developers. It can be a truly social, friendly, and fun community.</p>\n<p>Any future plans?\nToo many. One feature I definitely want to add is having picture based clues rather than text based clues. This would allow developers to be more creative, as well as produce simplistic yet entertaining content for users. I also have been toying with the idea of a point system. Pretty simple really: the more puzzles you solve, the more points you get. Maybe some days I could even design my own special event package that people can download and score even more points with. I also want to make the developer interface extremely simple: encourage developers with the ease of work. Also, maybe a better name for the app wouldn't be a bad idea... but I'm not sure yet. It would definitely be awesome if WPI ran with my NSO idea: I personally would have found it very cool to have a resource like that while I was learning the ropes. Then I also had the thought that teachers could use it to take attendance. Not sure how feasible that is though. The list goes on. The app has so many uses I can't explain it in a short bit of writing like this. I'm really excited to see where it could go.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gps\">gps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">server</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jfakult15/TriviaTour\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jfakult15/TriviaTour\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Not another scarf!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>LostFound</h1>\n<p>A mobile program that was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

We still wanted to do something hardware related, and when we saw the Myo we threw out ideas until we came up with something easy enough to do in a weekend with no experience.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows the user to set several canned responses to the different gestures that the Myo is capable of recognizing out of the box.  The Python script sets the text in the Lua script as a workaround for the fact that the Lua script is not allowed to access the filesystem as a requirement of working with the Myo.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>With lots of tears and cussing.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had literally no idea what we were doing at all, so uh... everything?\nEspecially github.  We had several problems with the commits not commiting due to mismatched heads.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Literally all of it.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to use Lua, why we need to keep better track of how we're using github.  Some of the team learned how to use python.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Canned Myo Responses</h2>\n<p>We're going to work on more projects together, ideally something Arduino based this time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DragonShadesX/hack_at_wpi_16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/DragonShadesX/hack_at_wpi_16\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["PythonGroceryList", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Grocery shopping</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Takes a recipe from FoodNetworks, lists the ingredients, and calculates the price</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>GUI with Java, Web scrapping with Python</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>At the very end, we could not figure out how to use Maven and we ran into a memory error. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Learned how to web scrape.\nBeautiful Gui</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to web scrape!\nThat you can mix two languages\nHow to work in a team for programming more efficiency list</p>\n<h2>What's next for PythonGroceryList</h2>\n<p>Try to migrate either to Python or to Java instead of using both languages to try to avoid the Memory issue and try to also make it faster</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jython</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/requests\">requests</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/beautiful-soup\">beautiful-soup</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/The01000001Team/PythonGroceryList.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/The01000001Team/PythonGroceryList.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]]]
