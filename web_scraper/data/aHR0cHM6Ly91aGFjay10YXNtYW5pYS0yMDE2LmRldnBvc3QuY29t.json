That's why when people want to lose weight, they attend group classes at the gym, share their progress and work with a fitness buddy. It offers a sense of accountability outside of your own motivation and makes it a lot more fun!</p>\n<p>This traditional methods don't work for everyone though. Not everyone is confident and comfortable sharing their weight or fitness goals. The social motivation comes with social exposure. But what if you had a virtual buddy who would check in on how you were going, helping you to keep those promises you make to yourself?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Good Buddy is an Android app that wants to help make you a better person.  It entices you to make promises to yourself that align with your long term health and fitness goals, then uses friendly (and timely reminders) to keep you on track and make sure that you keep your promises.</p>\n<p>When you set up Good Buddy, all it needs to know to get you started is your name, what goal you want to focus on and how you like to work towards that goal. For example, you might want to become more healthy and enjoy swimming.</p>\n<p>Your Good Buddy will then send you notifications to tell you when he's heading to the pool and check if you want to as well, then remind you when it gets closer to the agreed time. He'll also share what he's planning for lunch and give you a recipe if you like the look of it.</p>\n<p>Good Buddy isn't perfect, sometimes he has a bad day, just like you do, and when he does he'll want to work harder and make it up.  The idea is to build empathy between the </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Good Buddy was built using Android Studio to create the front end application that the users will interact with and Eclipse to code the back end server.  The application is coded in Java and Javascript.  The illustrations for our characters and user interface are all original artwork that has been created during the UHack weekend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had settled on our complete vision for the product quite early on in the weekend but one of our main challenges came in the form of breaking down what the minimum viable product would look like. In the end, we were able to distil our project to a single focus (improving health) and a single character (Billy T. the koala) and a few different interactions that we could prototype.  Our goal for the weekend was to build something that could be used for user testing and in particular, to test the assumptions made in our business model canvas.</p>\n<p>Our biggest assumption, is that we're assuming that people can experience extra motivation as a result of interactions with a fun and friendly character, even if that character is virtual and exists on a screen.  Customer interviews conducted during the weekend have been encouraging, but until we're able to put our MVP in front of real customers, we won't be able to really put this assumption through its paces. This was another challenge we ran into during the weekend, we were able to iterate on our business model canvas using online research, but we weren't able to spend as much time on actually interviewing potential customers or demonstrating our app prototype to them as we would have liked.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We haven't done a lot of Android app development and in particular, we haven't really built anything that's as reliant on timely notifications and events as this project required.  As a result, we were able to learn a heap about reactive programming and managing data and events during the weekend.  We're really happy with how that component of the project came together and we've built a base that can be extended to add extra characters, and which also has the potential to include a more intelligent back-end in the future (particularly including integration with third party APIs like FitBit, HealthKit, etc. which we didn't have time to tackle during this competition).</p>\n<p>We also spent some time figuring out workflows for bringing artwork into our app from Illustrator, quickly prototyping user interface and dialogue ideas and built a repeatable process for both.  As our plan has always been to add additional characters later on (and this is an important part of the business model), we wanted to create a system that was modular and would allow us to drop in new art and dialogue for new characters and push them as an update easily.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Good Buddy</h2>\n<p>We'd like to add more buddies and goals, likely with in app purchases.  For this to be a viable business, we'd need to ensure that people are willing to pay for additional characters and that those payments can exceed the customer acquisition costs.  This application could be bootstrapped to a point, but for us to achieve massive scale, we'd need to hit upon a model where Google and Facebook advertising (along with in-app referrals) could create a and sustain a viral loop and where the costs of this approach are exceeded by the revenue being created by in-app purchases.  After spending some serious time poring over the business model canvas and doing some research over the weekend on costs and revenue, we're confident that this is possible, but there's a bit more work to be done before we an properly test the theory.</p>\n<p>From a technical standpoint, one of the big areas for future exploration would be looking closely at third party app integration. For example, if you've got going on in your calendar Good Buddy will suggest taking a break from your goal to make sure you don't tire yourself out or stress over a strict goal. If you hit you hit your step goal for the day on a fitness platform like Fitbit, Good Buddy will jump in and add some extra positive enforcement. He's consistently there for you, and he's paying attention to other apps even when you aren't.</p>\n<h2>Quick Links</h2>\n<p><a

inspiration for this app came from our appreciation for our local computing society mascot, Darcy Rooster, and a common love of wildlife. We saw an opportunity for an improvement within the wild animal spotting community. With a single, easy-to-use iOS application, users will be able to efficiently and effectively organise wildlife images into a collection, allowing the user to easily share images, and also gain more knowledge about the wildlife in a selected image. Another positive outcome we saw, the app could collect data for researchers. They would be able to make uses of the possibly large data set by accessing and downloading from the site in hopes of assisting in research.</p>\n<h2>Research theme</h2>\n<p>Creative, cultural and social benefits will be achieved by the mobile app through promoting tourism and wildlife. Sharing data, knowledge and decisions research is achieved through our website and app collecting data storing in a database and making it publicly available.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is done through having two core parts to the project, the iOS application and the website.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The iOS application provides the core function to our large demographic market segments which consists of tourists and wildlife enthusiasts. This application is the way in which users collect, share and gain more information to educate themselves and others about the wildlife that they are finding at their particular locations. This is done by the users opening the application and they are given a menu screen in which they have two options. The first is \"View Collection,\" this view takes them to a collection or gallery of images. This has the ability to filter or share selected images to others. Selecting a single image itself from the view will take you to the photo screen that will show you a full screen view of the image and more information about about the animal that has been found in the image. The second is \"Add a Photo\" which will have a pop-up window that will allow either a selected pre-existing image from the gallery or to take a new photo. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Website provides the core information for our second target market (researchers), who may be interested in accessing the information that is collected and stored by the iOS application through a downloadable file to access the open source database.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The iOS application was made using SWIFT</li>\n<li>The website HTML, PHP, CSS, MYSQL (for database

Learnblock</p>\n<h2>Our Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As university students we have all faced the trials and tribulations associated with the examination period at university. We are constantly faced with a system that recognises talent based on the metric of exam performance, but we have not always been equipped with the knowledge or the skills necessary to address the parameters and constraints of the exam setting. There has been an unintentional rift between the learning outcomes that occur throughout the semester and the skills that are required to excel at the end of the semester in the exam setting. We wanted to develop a tool that makes the process of preparing for exams easier, less daunting and engaging, so that the exam is no longer perceived as a haphazard determinant wrought with strife and ambiguity and instead transform the experience, so that the exam is merely another juncture, that is manifested in excellence - something that we believe, as students, we deserve.</p>\n<h2>Our System</h2>\n<p>We have developed an adaptive, intuitive and interactive web-based examination learning platform that provides students with both the data and the tools that will improve their examination results with profound efficacy,which reduces the stress of students and improves the student satisfaction ratings for universities.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>We want to solve the disillusionment faced by students who struggle to find the help that they need to perform well in their exams, by providing them with real-time explanations and support that guides them through an understanding of relevant exam material. Students are manifested in dichotomous ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some students choose to engage, but do not have a structured approach to exam preparation. They have the knowledge, but not the skills to represent that knowledge for an exam setting. </li>\n<li>Some students legitimately struggle with core concepts but are unwilling to receive the support out of fear of judgement by the lecturer or vilification by peers.</li>\n<li>Some students seek relevant channels, but then fall short with individualised focus, because the support networks simply do not have the time to cater to the breadth of their needs, during the busiest time of semester.</li>\n<li>Furthermore, lecturers are under phenomenal stress as the university increasingly exacerbates their role and responsibilities. Sometimes they want to help - but repeating the answer to the same question multiple times is daunting, amidst the onset of irrevocable workloads.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to solve these problems, by utilising the power of information within the scope of a contextualised, relevant resource delivery channel.</p>\n<h2>Our Solution</h2>\n<p>Our tool is designed to focus on the two most important aspects of a student's exam based preparation experience:</p>\n<p>1) We want to tell students WHAT they should study and WHEN to study it\n2) We want to TEACH students THROUGH SOLUTIONS to EXAM-BASED questions using INTERACTIVE learning.</p>\n<h2>How are you using data to fix the problem</h2>\n<p>Our two-fold solution, involves using DATA in a two-fold way. </p>\n<p>1) How will we tell students what to study and when to study it?\nWe will be using data-centric artificial intelligence algorithms based on a hybrid machine learning system that we have developed that factors in expert knowledge WITH a predictive neural network algorithm in order to feed students with the relevant exam questions AND solutions to maximise their exam based performance within the time-frame they they have before the exam. We will strategically select questions for students based on the following factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When is their exam?</li>\n<li>How difficult have student found this exam, historically?</li>\n<li>What knowledge gaps have we identified through the user's interaction with the questions in our system?</li>\n<li>What subjects have the students performed better in from within their past and how are these subjects related to the new subjects they have coming up?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) How will we enable students to learn THROUGH exam solutions and interaction?\nWe have developed a personalised, interactive solution tutor. The solutions are labelled with metadata that connects critical points of the solution within the question, to the repository of data that already exists across the internet. We will provide students with modularised digital explanations that explore a component of the solution from two different lenses: the context of the question (at a granular level) and the theory related to the question (at a holistic level), so that students are correlating knowledge acquired from their courses WITH the actual exam questions.</p>\n<h2>How I built</h2>\n<p>To develop this solution, we used a combination of algorithmic and mathematical techniques, guised under the profundity of a seamless and engaging user experience.</p>\n<p>From an algorithmic perspective, we have utilised universal web-based technologies that enables us to scale a prototype with speed and efficacy (Codeigniter, PHP, MySQL, jQuery and AJAX). From a user experience point of view, we have used principles in participatory design and human computer interaction to develop a user experience that is INCLUSIVE of the demographic we are catering for. </p>\n<p>The reality is that current e-learning platforms are being developed by EDUCATORS, who are removed from the pertinent challenges that face students. Therefore, we used white board scaffolds and wireframes that brought students in as active participants to weigh in on the design and provide their suggestions. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The onset of any project is incredibly idealistic that is broad in nature. Therefore, one major challenge we faced was honing down a product. Even though our system was capable of so many more things (learning, data analytics for educators), we paired back our focus to our two fundamental areas and this was a time-consuming endeavour.</p>\n<p>The process of developing advanced functionality that is intuitive and user friendly is always a challenge. Being under time intensive pressure, having to make difficult decisions in a speed driven environment at times hindered our creativity: as we had to sometimes favour function over form, even though form was an integral ingredient to our product. Part of this also meant further simplifying functionality. </p>\n<p>The process of user targeting and business modelling was difficult. Our team was lucky enough to have background in e-learning systems. One member is currently developing an e-learning platform for Medicine students, while other members have also been active tutors. We recognised the fact that we could target multiple demographics (high school students and university students), each who have different needs and requirements, each of who operate under a different business model, and each which presents opportunities and challenges. Honing our market and having conviction with our choice was a difficult task amidst a context of development, whose decisions were also dependent on this analysis.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were incredibly proud of the phenomenally positive feedback we received by every member regarding our concept. Past students repeatedly told us how they remembered the challenges of preparing for exams and how they would have loved such a system in their time and the practical implications it could have had on their learning. Present students compelled us by how proactive they were willing to be a part of our system beyond this competition, to realise its goals, given the universal appeal this has to so many stakeholders. This also included university lecturers who believed that such a system will help their students, while also saving them much time towards the end of the semester, where the system could play a supportive role in student learning.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we were proud at the sheer persistence, perseverance and determination of our team, as we ventured through the late hours of the night to push the parameters of the human condition to realise our goal and aspiration. To us, this is not just an idea, it is a revolutionary concept that could transform student education forever. Its a system that we need and we want to actualise, utilising the strength of collaborative partnerships within our group dynamic.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned conflict resolution strategies and the importance of receiving opinions from people of all walks of life. No opinion is invalid, no matter how critical it may appear to sound. People here, exist to help one another actualise their dreams and aspirations. We developed ways to meet in the middle over concepts, while recognising and appreciating everyone's value to the concept.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Learnblock</h2>\n<p>Our plan is to develop a proprietary prototype and develop a proof of concept through market involvement within a constrained environment to validate our concept and ultimately our beliefs. We will do this, by utilising our resource potential within ourselves, to offer this tool to ICT education students, using our knowledge of curricula to render and populate relevant exam questions and interactive solutions. We will offer product as a Beta test to the University of Tasmania's School of ICT and Engineering, with the hope to expand our product offering over the course of one year, to incorporate a second school, on commencement of concept proof.</p>\n<p>We intend to conduct an evaluation of the product at the one year mark, and begin an expansion strategy, so that we cater to the broader Tasmanian University populace. </p>\n<p>The system, ultimately is universal and can be expanded both nationally and internationally. Our five year projection is to meet a key performance indicator, whereby we support at least 20 Australian universities, before beginning a global strategy, which is beyond our foreseeable future at this stage.</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.learnblock.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.learnblock.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.learnblock.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Shop Smart | Still Installing (open)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hW3Nd6kgyHg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shop Smart | Still Installing (open) \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/150/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Detailed business model</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shop Smart | Still Installing (open) \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/090/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>FAQs</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shop Smart | Still Installing (open) \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/091/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Value: User Friendly</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shop Smart | Still Installing (open) \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/089/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Initial UI concept designs</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shop Smart | Still Installing (open) \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/773/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Product database overview</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shop Smart | Still Installing (open) \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/774/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Price list database overview (updated weekly) -

the recent Census is a perfect example of that! What we\u2019re hoping to create is a product that gives users a very clear <strong>\u2018What\u2019s in it for Me\u2019</strong> by providing an easy to use, intuitive shopping app that can be accessed by the whole family or business, which lets them know how much they can save each time they complete a shopping list, providing a running tally of the amount they\u2019ve saved to date using the app, tracking specials, telling them when they should or shouldn\u2019t buy specific products based on their price history, and offering them tailored sale advice, based on their buying habits. </p>\n<p>If we do this properly, by providing users with a free, accessible, intuitive and easy to use app that genuinely saves them money and makes their lives easier, we hope that people will be more likely to use the app regularly enough to provide <strong>real, usable data</strong> that can then be passed on to UTas and other appropriate research bodies to help inform <strong>health research</strong>. </p>\n<p>We plan to start simple and small, only releasing the app on <strong>Android</strong> initially, only including products from the two big supermarket chains (Coles and Woolworths), and only providing a fairly limited set of core functionalities in the first instance, including taking a list of products from the user, and returning advice re how much they would save if they chose to shop at Coles or Woolworths, or if they were prepared to split their shop between the two stores. It would tell them how much they\u2019ve saved to date using the app, and show a shopping history. It would track items they wanted to \u2018watch\u2019, to see when they came on sale, and would offer advice on when and where they should buy certain items on their list, e.g. we all know that you should never buy Vitamin tablets at full price, as they go for 50% off regularly! Basically, we aim to help people shop the bargains more often than not! As an added benefit, we hope that by saving money on their grocery budget, people will have more 'disposable' money to spend on perceived 'expensive', healthier foods, including fresh fruit and veggies. We hope that the app may also help to break down some of the, often false, perceptions that <strong>eating healthy</strong> is more expensive.</p>\n<p>Looking to the future, we would plan to expand the functionalities to include other shops beyond \u2018the big two\u2019, e.g. IGAs and other smaller supermarkets and local producers. We would make the specials <strong>more tailored</strong>, integrate suggested recipes based on <strong>people\u2019s product history</strong>, and continue to improve the <strong>machine learning</strong> element of the project. We would push the app onto <strong>IOS</strong>, as well as launch a <strong>web platform</strong>. Once we started to get some credibility and traction with users we may also look at asking some extra questions, like whether you got the flu this winter, and how often you eat out or buy take away food, to try and further increase the value of the data being collected.</p>\n<p><strong>In a nutshell</strong>, our goal is to create a product that not only improves people\u2019s health, and helps them make ends meet, but also, potentially, will help to inform health research into the future.  </p>\n<h2>The Prototype</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://tarbot.net:7002/products?search=ice\" rel=\"nofollow\">You can play with our database here</a></strong>: change the word after the '=' to change the search - use commas to separate words!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, though we invested significant time in building the Android app interface for this project, it was developed in multiple places simultaneously, and at the point at which we tried integrate the different elements, we encountered dependency conflicts, with some libraries strictly requiring different versions of Android - as we'd built this far in, it was too late to start over from scratch. However: we didn't want the major work we'd been putting into the database (backend), to go to waste, which is why we've provided the above link, to let you have a play with our data. The screenshots we've included of the UI are there to give an indication of the look and feel of the app that we would develop further if given the opportunity.</p>\n<p>The scraping process was a significant one; working to find the private APIs used by Coles and Woolworths to publish this data was a complicated process in and of itself. We then needed to standardise the data, including weights and measurements. We tracked not only 'specials', but also multi buys, and created 'generic' products to use in the search process. We had to use different processes for each Coles and Woolworths, as they have significantly different set ups.

We'll be able to tell you when specials are actually 'special enough' to warrant adding to your list, and let you know when things are likely to come on sale at a good price.</li>\n<li><strong>shared lists</strong>, that are accessible by multiple family members/household members/business colleagues, replacing the combination of sticky notes and frantic test messages currently employed by many shoppers! By having the app on your phone, and accessible by the appropriate group of people, not only will your list be far more complete than before, it will also be more detailed, including brands and weights and varieties, making it much easier to safely <strong>deputise the shopping</strong> to someone else!</li>\n<li><strong>watch list</strong>, which you can add items to until they come up on sale, at which point you'll be <strong>prompted</strong> to move it onto your shopping list</li>\n<li><strong>tailored advice</strong> re specials and savings, based on your <strong>buying history</strong></li>\n<li><strong>searchable history</strong>, tracking your previous list items, and how much you've saved to date with the app</li>\n<li>a few, <strong>simple questions upon sign up</strong> that will help to make the data collected more useful to researchers, including ave. household income, number of house members and postcode (if not already collected from your device's location)</li>\n<li><strong>single sign in</strong> using your Google account</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Later Releases</h2>\n<hr/>\n<ul>\n<li>expand to <strong>incorporate other stores</strong>, e.g. IGAs and smaller, local supermarkets</li>\n<li>launch <strong>OS app</strong> and <strong>web interface</strong> for better accessibility </li>\n<li>fully integrate <strong>machine learning</strong>, that will learn your habits, tastes and preferences, and put them into effect in how the app responds to you, and what it suggests and recommends</li>\n<li>integrate <strong>suggested recipes</strong> based on people\u2019s product history</li>\n<li>network with health organisations to work together to promote the app to our target audiences, and gather feedback on its usability in real world test cases</li>\n<li>work closely with researchers to ensure that the data being collected by the app is relevant to the research being conducted</li>\n<li>once we started to get some <strong>credibility</strong> and traction with users we may also look at asking some <strong>extra questions</strong>, like whether you got the flu this winter, and how often you eat out or buy take away food - these questions would be based on advice received from the researchers involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Business Model Canvas</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p>A Prezi presentation exploring our <strong>Business Model Canvas</strong> is <a href=\"http://prezi.com/r1jqwakrtwmb/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy\" rel=\"nofollow\">available here</a>.</p>\n<h2>UHack Research Themes</h2>\n<hr/>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.utas.edu.au/research/our-research-themes/better-health\" rel=\"nofollow\">Better Health</a>: This project aims to collect authentic, real-world data on what food people are buying, linked with their annual household income, number of household members and location.

We noticed that while there are applications that help users to manage their day to day spending, there are not currently any tools that provide a full range of financial services to everyday people. We realized that we could fill this niche by creating a virtual financial advisor, and thus Raymond was born.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>Our project is an online financial advice service that utilizes an AI assistant; Raymond. By using Natural Language Processing, Raymond can interpret the user's input and dispense financial advice based on their situation. </p>\n<p>Raymond guides users through the information gathering process in an accompanying form. Raymond responds to questions from the user prompted by the form, and engages in a semi-structured conversation to naturally elicit their needs should they be unsure.</p>\n<p>Raymond is designed for people who cannot afford a financial advisor, or simply wish to better manage their own finances. Raymond is targeted at people with little or no financial knowledge, and can provide definitions for financial terminology. </p>\n<h2>Our process</h2>\n<p><strong>Where does the knowledge come from?</strong>\nRaymond's knowledge base is sourced from financial planning text books, and consultation with an actual financial advisor.  </p>\n<p><strong>What did we use to build it?</strong>\nWe used a number of technologies to prototype our web application. For our applications back end we made use of Node.js as the run time environment, which is supported by a number of intelligence services that we needed to use.</p>\n<p>To implement our intelligent messaging system (i.e. chatbot) we decided upon the well regarded IBM Watson Conversation service.</p>\n<p>The web page for the application was developed using the MaterializeCSS framework.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this use data differently?</strong>\nAlthough there are existing applications that provide users with information about their finances, they only provide feedback on specific elements, such as spending. Raymond uses this data differently, by providing feedback to the user based on their financial situation as a whole. This informs and empowers users to make well educated financial decisions. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>During our first day of implementation we were building the project in Java and utilizing an open source natural language processor package known as OpenNLP. We decided to drop this setup as we soon became aware that completing our project would be completely unfeasible using those technologies.</p>\n<p>We queried the wandering mentors looking for alternatives. We were drawn to IBM's AI services because it was offering a good product that we could use for free and integrate with other work that we'd already done. IBM Watson worked flawlessly and was relatively easy to integrate into our application.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team had no experience with implementing chatbots or natural language processing prior to this event. \nWe have learned a lot of valuable information about these fields, specifically in the use of IBM Watson. Node.js was also unfamiliar to us, and so we had to learn as we developed.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Raymond</h2>\n<p>We plan to continue building Raymond's knowledge base, so that eventually he will be able to dispense advice of a similar quality to an actual financial advisor. To do this we will need to collect more financial data, and also develop the conversations paths further. There is also potential for machine learning (such as the IBM Watson's Alchemy service) to be implemented in this project, which would help to build the knowledge base even further. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materializecss</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lordchalky/Raymond.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lordchalky/Raymond.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on our backend and I implemented our chatbot.

Individually or collectively we had not heard about it before that. We started wondering how much is actually known about by-catch and if we can do something to change status quo. And we believe we can. The idea here is to create a not for profit awareness campaign that can help both adults and children, consumers or businesses to understand by-catch, that it is edible and so it is a waste to throw it back into the sea.</p>\n<p>If one speaker sharing the issue has affected the conscience of 6 people (including one 7 year old), the efforts of 6 individuals can affect 60 and that 60 can affect 600, and so on. The ethos is to aim for a social change, through the use of an awareness campaign, aimed at kids through a game application and also at adults through a website that curate relevant information aiding understanding and change of attitude from by-catch to produce. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Buy Catch is a targeted awareness campaign. It has been developed to change the image of fishery by-catch from unwanted dead sea life thrown overboard to edible, viable produce.</p>\n<p>We are not including any endangered mammals or fish in this campaign. We truly believe that such living things should be released back into the water if they are still alive. We are targeting the image change of edible fish that are already dead after being caught, that are thrown over purely because they are not commercial. A product being commercially viable to fisheries depends mainly on consumer thinking and demand.</p>\n<p>The target of this campaign is thus to introduce the consumers and businesses to gaining a better understanding of by-catch and how it can indeed become edible, affordable, healthy source of nourishment.</p>\n<h2>What We built</h2>\n<h3>Website</h3>\n<p>In the prototype the buy catch project is embedded into the intelligent capital website. We are going to adapt the prototype into a multi-platform compatible website that can give both data visualisation and interactive apps and tools for consumers and business.</p>\n<h3>Game App</h3>\n<p>The game will try to interact with children to engage them in a fun way and educate them about by catch. There is scope for other apps and games to perhaps introduce by-catch based recipes and information.</p>\n<h3>Viral Video</h3>\n<p>To kick of the awareness campaign, we will create a viral video that will use by catch in collaboration with charities to either raise funds through a buy catch produce auction or by cooking buy catch as sustainable and ethical meals for a charity based shelter.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>There are several tools that we use to build our idea.</p>\n<h3>Collaboration:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hangouts.google.com/\"

experienced by medical staff and their understanding of individual patient welfare.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Smart Health is an integrated wearable patient ID system that tracks heart rate, blood oximetry, and patient location. This real time data is collated to provide performance indicators for each doctor, ward, time and patient. This data is analysed by the system to highlight anomalies and track patient progress under different conditions.</p>\n<h2>Value Proposition</h2>\n<p>For the Hospital: \nSmart Health provides automated alerts and highlighting of anomalies in patient conditions.\nSmart Health saves costs by allowing efficient patient care and the appropriate allocation of hospital resources. \nSmart Health reduces the incidence of costly malpractice by continually monitoring patient condition and reactions subsequent to medications.\nSmart Health allows for the data analysis of patient welfare data.\nSmart Health highlights times of the day when patient anxiety is high. For instance if this occurs at visiting time or meals time. This allows the hospital to refine its operational efficiency.\nSmart Health data allows the hospital to manage its resources in advance of predicted events.\nFor the Patient:\nSmart Health provides constant monitoring and reassurance to the patient.\nSmart Health allows the hospital to better manage its resources to provide better outcomes.\nSmart Health reduces the costs of health care which are passed on to the patient.\nSmart Health data can be used to benchmark hospitals to enable choices based on performance.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The prototype wearable was built on CAD software (AutoCAD) and printed using a fused deposition modeller 3D printer. The prototype contains an RFID chip to simulate the logging in an decoding of patient data. The interface prototype was created using a python program running on a computer. When a user scans their wearable health device their health profile is automatically loaded onto the screen (refer to video for demonstration). The RFID reader is smart enough to identify the unique ID of each patient's wearable device and only load the relevant personal health information of that user. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Coming together as a team. Unfortunately one of the people who committed to be on our team did not show up on the weekend, which left us under resourced, however, it was very satisfying to see the way the remaining team, made up of total strangers, pulled together to produce a working prototype - both a hardware model and software.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Teamwork depends on the individual. Problem solving attitude with a positive outlook can produce good results.

Although, they are missing the categorical ability and specificity for trading in <strong>food</strong>. <strong>Mark</strong>ing the location of where a product is grown, as well as from where the vendor is operating (say a farmers market or a school car park) will allow for a change in human and social behaviour and an enhancement in keeping money local.</p>\n<p>$8B of food is wasted in Australia every year, 33% of that being food that is still fresh. While this is happening, locally there seems to be much difficulty in finding fruit trees and veggie growers nearby that produce what is desired. Farmers markets are currently mostly offline, and the vendors limited in their alternatives for trading and advertising. Not having, say, fresh figs in the supermarket, and then going to the markets only to find that due to limited space that they have sold out, when you know there's got to be some around nearby - it seems to be an information issue mixed with a problem in small volume trading.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The key feature will be an <em>interactive map</em> with <strong><em>marks</em></strong> in and around a specified area for all of one\u2019s <em>favourite <strong>foods</strong></em> and vendors such that the user is able to select a number of products <em>on the way</em> to school, home, a friend\u2019s house or work, and purchase everything one would normally buy at the supermarket but <em>directly from the community</em>.</p>\n<p>Small-medium scale growers can easily advertise their produce and even compete for top spots on the search list by sacrificing a percentage of the transaction. Anyone that eats food can use <strong><em>Food Mark</em></strong> to search nearby for fresh local goods, rather than food trafficked from all over the world, sometimes perhaps even to the mainland and back.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><em><strong>Food Mark</strong></em> was created from scratch with PyCharm - so that is HTML5, CSS and Python, with all the icons made in photoshop and adobe-illustrator.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Understanding what it is we wanted and exactly how much of that we can produce under competition conditions.</p>\n<p>Creating a homepage was a challenge, complete with a search bar and an interactive map, beyond just the header and footer setup with all the images and colour co-ordination</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The amount of RAW code produced in such a short period - with most other teams using premade themes and templates, we were surprised at how much we could produce starting with not even files or directories. Purchasing a server and rigging up the software for hosting was an entirely new thing, and it took some serious time and reading through of documentation to push through and get it up and running.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The importance of wire-frames and clear communication in enunciating an idea from one's head into code. As well as the need for discussion and some mild repetition to understand the workings of our own minds in order to get to work effectively as a team and produce something meaningful</p>\n<h2>What's next for Food Mark</h2>\n<p>To complete the database structure and web-templates for multi-listings and single listings, as well as interactive j-frames for display and tailored search functions. We'll need to analyse local regulation for certain food products and perhaps even get in contact with government to confirm exactly what we are able to do and what kind of awareness the user needs and agreements they need to come to terms with in order to function appropriately to minimize risk - particularly with seafood and meat products.</p>\n<p>We'd love to organize an interactive ability for the site in the sense of functioning Twitter and Facebook integration, eventually even producing iOS and Android applications for direct-to-device notifications, rather than the slight delay of a web-app / email system.</p>\n<p>Perhaps even expanding to allowing businesses to advertise their secondary produce such as relishes or even restaurant meals - to try and provide an all-inclusive singular location application for food of all types. The more the user can find about their location with ease, the better for the local economy and the happier local business people are.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scss\">scss</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/grunt-js\">grunt.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://uhack.bungeshea.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://uhack.bungeshea.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>uhack.bungeshea.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sheabunge/foodmark\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sheabunge/foodmark\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the website, working in front-end languages and Python.", "", ""]], ["Study Session ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIMiaDF_ID4?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Study Session  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/360/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>2030now</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration -</h2>\n<p>As a student, i have found mylo (our university's student portal) is hard to navigate. For example, when collecting relevant information i have to open to many tabs and the website is not easy to navigate. There is no way for me to organise my information or to even give feedback, instantly or anonymously, electronically. </p>\n<h2>what is my product?</h2>\n<p>Study session is a social media network that aids student development. Study session helps students: who live in other areas and feel less socially accepted, or more socially isolated. It helps students navigate courses digitally, in preparation to the university's website.   </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It assists learning by social interaction digitally. It also allows voting feedback, which distinguishes students desires' and improves teacher / student relationships. </p>\n<p>Study session has an additional feature which enables users to upload content to group members, or friends, only which helps share relevant content -to the right people- with little need to sort .</p>\n<p>Study session is a social media network for additional studying. As a struggling student, i have identified what would work for me, digitally, when being involved in the scene of the university. When i first started university, learning the online system was like trying to do a course within itself. Navigating the university's website was time consuming and it prevented me from learning what i was there for. I also felt different because of where i lived and there was no way for me to easily express my concerns anonymously without the feeling of great discomfort. I also like studying at midnight and i like to find people who are studying at midnight. I can do this with my app without the need to drive all the way across town which allows me to save money for other essentials. </p>\n<p>Study session aims to define the interests of students. Students are able to vote anonymously on teachers performances; or, on their course of study. They can also vote on what they think would resolve issues surrounding teacher/ student, or subject, conflicts.  </p>\n<p>I, personally, am restricted when socializing at university. Also, being on the outer edge of town can be an issue as well as having different terminology. In addition to other features I have created a user friendly platform which accommodates other socially isolated peoples. Study session includes all the functionalities of most other social media websites: groups, friends,and notifications. And, it's easy to navigate. Study session aims to define the way students feel about their teachers performance, and/ or the subject which they study. Included, in my app is a voting section where students are able to hold teachers accountable for certain actions. They can also let other students know what worked well for them within the unit. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>i used a buddy app theme using WordPress and found site-ground to be useful as a reliable website host. \nI had to learn new custom css coding - self taught. (<a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.w3schools.com/css/</a>)  (<a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.udacity.com/</a>) -there is still work to be done such as being in connection to the university's student services portal ,however this, this sets a precedent  for the next best application to help with  student development.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>If only we could list all the challenges we ran into; how long's a piece of string, really. I have had to learn how to do custom css and learn about other programming platforms such as python. I have had to find out what works and what doesn't (in regards to other website building platforms). I have had to engage with people outside of my comfort zone to obtain much needed advice. i have fixed numerous errors -including resolving hosting issues. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of -</h2>\n<p>I value most new things i learn or achieve. In regards to my app, i am proud of the whole thing. I will continue.  i am proud of attending U-hack and being part of a community which drives innovation. I am proud i got to offer my advice with other projects also. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>At the end of the day, i have identified that new friends, or more crucially, social interaction is the surest way which enables me to contrast my thoughts. It is a very effective way of learning. This is one useful tool which i will use to address the 2030 now issue. I have also learnt that learning is most fun. I have also learnt that by not testing my concept, it will only ever be an incorrect perceived thought- a video which i watch at U hack. I will never forget the importance of that video as it contrasted, and was closely related to, some of my previous behaviors.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for study session</h2>\n<p>1) That string! Study session will be a middle body between students and universities. Students are able to join familiar groups of study, or contact student services directly. Study session has a planner where all timetables, events will be on the one page which is easy to navigate. 2 It will adapt with anything topical. 3 Addressing global pain and suffering (by most definitions) through mere exposure. 3 Study Session will provoke imagination. It's through imagination concepts such as this are thought. </p>\n<p>Please view my additional video for a mobile viewing experience.\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMor10OnjG4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMor10OnjG4</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wordpress\">wordpress</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.smartphoneclassifieds.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.smartphoneclassifieds.com.au\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.smartphoneclassifieds.com.au</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/studysession\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://twitter.com/studysession\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>twitter.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/studdysession/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/studdysession/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.facebook.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["With the advice from others i found a host, i found a theme and i built it simply.  \n"]], ["JobsWow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqQLJoZ0-zA?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobsWow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/787/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobsWow \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/328/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>wow</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobsWow \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/784/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobsWow \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/785/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobsWow \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/786/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobsWow \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/404/806/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>What is JobsWow?</h1>\n<p>JobsWow is an online platform that aims to connect job seekers and the curious minded to career paths, employers and job vacancies in their local community. </p>\n<p>JobsWow works by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Helping users to identify their individual strengths and talents</li>\n<li>Directing users to skill sets based on their talents</li>\n<li>Displays career paths and occupations that use those skill sets</li>\n<li>The user can then select an occupation and JobsWow will connect them with employers in their area</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept of JobsWow was born from a desire to address one of the largest issues affecting Tasmanian growth; Youth Unemployment. </p>\n<h3>The Problem</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Youth unemployment in Tasmania is, at a state level, amongst the highest in the country at a staggering <a href=\"http://library.bsl.org.au/jspui/bitstream/1/9004/1/BSL_Aust_youth_unemployment_hotspots_Mar2016.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">19.6% in January 2016</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Currently, in Tasmania, only 25% of Year 10 students continue on to complete Year 12 studies. In conjunction with this, the majority of domestic intake to the Univeristy of Tasmania is mature aged students (23+); there is growing concern that students are leaving school early to find themselves either unable to find work or in an occupation that they eventually leave and return to their studies at the tertiary level.</p>\n<p>JobsWow seeks to minimise this issue by providing students in Year 9 and 10 with the tools they need to be able to assess where their skills and interests lie and connect those to potential careers and what steps they will need to take to get there (tertiary study, TAFE etc.) </p>\n<p>Additionally, at current there is a large disconnect between the education system and the job market. There is little to no interaction between employers and those within the education system excluding established graduate offerings from large corporations and scarce internship programs.</p>\n<p>The information that is made available to job seekers is difficult to access and many resources are biased in their services, offering information that has been tailored to suit vested interests of an education provider or employment agency. </p>\n<p>JobsWow connects users with training courses/institutions that are in their area whilst also providing them with user reviews of the course being offered. </p>\n<h3>What Makes JobsWow Unique?</h3>\n<p>JobsWow is unique in Tasmania and Australia in that it provides users with an intergrated platform where they can assess their interests and skills, browse what occupations use their particular skills and then see available job listing or links to relevant training information. All of this is completed in the one application within only a few clicks of the homepage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JobsWow's integrated platform replaces several competition services that seek to answer only half the problem or provide biased information and potentially only offer training courses that they have a vested interest in rather than suggesting what would best suit the user. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h5>Research Goals</h5>\n<p>JobsWow was developed not only to provide a solution to a genuine community need, but to conform and to address the University of Tasmania's <a href=\"http://www.utas.edu.au/research/partnering/creativity,-culture-and-society\" rel=\"nofollow\">research goals for creativity, culture and society</a>.</p>\n<h5>Use of Data</h5>\n<p>JobsWow draws it's data directly from <a href=\"http://joboutlook.gov.au/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australian Government</a> databases provided from the Department of Employment based on providing in depth information and pathways for over 350 individual occupations. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>JobsWow takes this data and displays it in a user friendly platform that is efficient and enjoyable to use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Target Market(s)</h3>\n<p>Our primary target market/end user is high school students currently in Year 9 or Year 10. By providing students with the tools they need to be able to identify their skills and interests and how that links with potential career paths, JobsWow hopes to eliminate the confusion that students face when considering the future for their education.</p>\n<p>Our secondary target market is the employers and learning institutions. Based on what users select as their skill set and area of interest we are able to build a complete profile for employers and institutions to not only access for recruitment but provide critical feedback on potential gaps in their offerings or areas of potential growth.</p>\n<h3>Design Process</h3>\n<p>We developed using an agile method, designing and implementing features as required. Our focus was on creating a simple and easy-to-use interface, so ensuring that the interface was aesthetically pleasing and functioned correctly were top priorities.</p>\n<h5>Problems We Faced</h5>\n<p>As we iterated over the client interface and started adding more features, we were spending quite a lot of time rewriting code to implement wanted features or just avoiding features all together due to the substantial amount of time that would be required to implement those features which would then detract from the amount of time that we would have to be adding the actual content of our project to the application.</p>\n<h5>Our Solution</h5>\n<p>Initially some rewrites were being done to further accommodate additional features, we got to a point where it would be substantially time consuming to be constantly reiterating over the application so we just started to only implement the core features for the app and leave out anything extra where possible.</p>\n<h5>Tools Used and Why</h5>\n<p>We used web based technologies such as HTML5, CSS and JavaScript as they're supported across the board on a wide range of different devices. This allowed us to make a single app that runs on any device whether it be mobile, tablet or desktop while providing the same experience for everyone. For the server we leveraged Node.js which is a server-side implementation of JavaScript which allowed for rapid prototyping and, much like the client application, a single application that can run anywhere with minimal impact.</p>\n<h3>Future development</h3>\n<h5>Personality Testing</h5>\n<p>In its current state, JobsWow requires students to self assess what they perceive to be their relative strength or personality type. This is not idea as we are essentially targeting students who already feel lost in regards to their skills and what they should do next. To address this gap in our service we plan to implement personality based skills quizes into the assessment process such that if the student does not know what category they fit into, they can complete the short quiz for some guidance.</p>\n<h5>Additional Feedback on User Preferences</h5>\n<p>In the future we aim to implement an additional skills recommendation built around social media. When a user selects a particular occupation, JobsWow will recommend events, club and social meet-ups in the users local area. For example;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A user clicks that they are interested in computing JobsWow will give them Facebook links to interest groups such as: UTAS Computing and Technology Society, TasGDS, StartUpTas, UHack 2016 event page etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>The Application</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://uhack.notadam.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">JobsWow</a></p>\n<h1>The Team!!</h1>\n<p>In order;

That is, in today\u2019s fast paced society, the range of skills required are far beyond the skills we acquire from traditional learning. This also leads to mental health challenges caused by young people disengaging from education and feeling under-qualified/un-valuable. We were inspired to break this negative cycle by reengaging individuals through short, interactive educational courses.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h3>What Is ValYou?</h3>\n<p>ValYou is an online platform that helps young people to reengage with learning through micro-courses to increase their feelings of self-worth and improve their quality of life.</p>\n<p>Using a marketplace model, we provide the user with access to a wide range of micro-courses which are educational courses of no longer than 60 minutes in length, with a maximum of 5 minutes per chapter.</p>\n<p>These courses are provided by individual subject matter experts through our web application and serve to re-engage learners by enabling them to learn new topics, with minimal emotional, time or financial investment. There is a reduction in emotional costs due to an increased perception of fun and simplicity through the \u2018micro-learning\u2019 concept. This allows us to re-engage otherwise disheartened learners through the perception of \u2018learning made easy\u2019.</p>\n<h3>How Does The Application Layout Work?</h3>\n<p>The core application has two elements to it, the student learning and course publication elements.</p>\n<p>The student learning platform enables students to access a wide range of micro-courses, with the home page divided into 4 primary categories</p>\n<p>1-  Suggested Courses (Scrolling Carousel on top of application)\nUsing previous course history, ValYou automatically suggests new micro-course options which allows the student to gradually gain subject-specific knowledge while mitigating the risks and fears that come with larger courses.</p>\n<p>2-  New Courses\nA list of new courses that have been released on the app in chronological order.</p>\n<p>3-  Popular Courses\nA list of popular courses, based on the number of recent student enrolments.</p>\n<p>4-  Featured Courses\nA list of featured courses which are unique course offerings as decided by the ValYou team</p>\n<p>5-  My Courses\nA selection of course enrolments which includes current and previously completed courses to allow user to easily view past achievements and promotes a sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p>The key design ideology behind the application was to ensure very minimal intertia by ensuring that the application was user friendly, had fast loading times and was immersive. This is accomplished by providing uses with immediate access to available courses, with no additional input required by the user beyond login, to promote user engagement and increase course registration rates.</p>\n<p>Each chapter of a course also provides the user with information regarding chapter length to further emphasise how short, simply &amp; easy each course will be.</p>\n<p>At the end of each course, course creators are able to upsell other larger, paid courses to a student. These larger courses will be hosted natively on the ValYou platform and provide a new revenue stream for course creators. It allows course creators to easily target a new market of students who previously, would have much higher customer acquisition costs as they were hesitant to invest in larger courses.</p>\n<p>ValYou takes a 25% facilitator fee from any courses sold through the application.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our mobile application using React-Js which is a great library for prototyping quickly, by the second day we had a functioning app that we took to the street to gather user feedback. React is almost the same as react-native, which means would could easily port our code base to a native platform if need be.</p>\n<p>We made it a single page app, so there\u2019s no page refreshes, even though the web is our platform our app has a native feel, this is where the future seems to be heading.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ve written our code using newer language features (ES2015, ES7) to take advantage of better syntax and to keep our code base clean and we\u2019ve been transpiling this using babel before generating our client assets as browsers don\u2019t widely support these features yet.</p>\n<p>For the backend we used node.js, this means we can run the same code on both the client and server to create an isomorphic app, i.e. we render the html on both the client and the server. This means we get the best of both worlds, a truly dynamic single page app but also the responsiveness of static html loading very quickly.</p>\n<p>We used webpack to bundle and minify all our client assets into small chunks to load so the user never has to download more than necessary.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into (so far)</h2>\n<p>A key issue we dealt with was alignment and clarity. As we were a group of 5 individuals who had never worked together before, it was initially a challenge to align all of our ideas and collaborate as one uniform team. Through open-communication, we were able to align all of our ideas and passions to come up with a final product that met each of our goals.</p>\n<p>Next, as we were all passionate about mental health, it was challenging to decide which problem we wanted to tackle. That is, clinical mental health or general mental health and wellbeing. We decided to focus on our ability to have a long-standing impact on society and as such, choose to help those with general mental health and learning difficulties.</p>\n<p>This also lead to issues with time-management as we had to cut out many core feature elements from our application as we only had a limited amount of time. We decided to focus on the front end, student user-interface to showcase the potential of the application and follow this, we can build and expand the marketplace elements post UHack.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our biggest accomplishment is the formulation of our target market and a finalised business model within the first afternoon. We were able to accomplish this and breakthrough the barriers we initially faced by emphasising open lines of communication and leveraging our individual strengths and passions.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we learnt the importance of identifying a pain point. Instead of finalising an application and then identifying an audience that would find value in it, we leveraged the concepts we all have learnt from the Lean Startup. We mutually agreed that in order to have the biggest impact on society with our app, we first needed to help just one person. That one person was Jay.</p>\n<p>Jay was our initial consumer profile. A young male, struggling with low self-esteem and mental health difficulties due to a lack of employment opportunities post university, we focused on developing ValYou\u2019s feature set to meet his needs. In doing so, we eventually came up with our target market, their pain points and a solution to solve their problems.</p>\n<p>This taught us the importance of identifying your market and understanding their needs, prior to creating anything. It also improved our ability to work as a team and increased our ability to come to an agreement on what features were important as we had a fixed problem to solve. This also helped any personal biases for feature sets that were prevalent before identifying a pain point to solve.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ValYou</h2>\n<p>In the future, ValYou will include an inbuilt content publication platform to allow course creators to not only publish free courses but to also publish blog posts, directly communicate with students and build their own personal brand profile within the application.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the application will have an inbuilt data analysis feature which will analysis the behavioural habits of student\u2019s who complete micro-course. This information will then be used to automatically present suggested micro-courses, based on user behaviour (which also indicates user interest) which allows the student the gradually gain a large amount of subject relevant knowledge. This then empowers students to move onto larger courses within the application &amp; even accredited courses, outside of the application as they have now got a sense of confidence regarding that subject area.</p>\n<p>In the future, we also plan on implementing a data based mood tracking system to allow our users to track &amp; evaluate their moods. Through this system, we also hope to assist in mitigating suicide rates by identifying those that may be of at risk. These individuals are then given the ability to easily get in contact with suicide support services such as Lifeline and Beyond Blue.</p>\n<h2>How Did We Use Data Differently?</h2>\n<p>We used data differently through our micro-course educational system. Instead of having students register for large courses, with the risk of not enjoying the content matter, we have the courses target them instead. The application will analyse the user\u2019s course completion data to present to them potential courses based on their habits. This allows students to engage with learning, in topics they enjoy, with minimal risk or investment on their end.</p>\n<p>This data also provides course creators to target customers through topic-specific behavioural habits. Thus, improving the experience for both the student and teacher to bring the passion back to learning once again. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://morning-tundra-60382.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://morning-tundra-60382.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>morning-tundra-60382.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AlastairTaft/uhack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AlastairTaft/uhack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]]]
