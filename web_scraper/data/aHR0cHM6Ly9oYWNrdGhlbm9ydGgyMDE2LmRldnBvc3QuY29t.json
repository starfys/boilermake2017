This problem is worsening along with the exponential growth of the human population, and very little seems to be being done about it. We were inspired to improve how farmers collect insights on the current state of their farm by creating a free and easy-to-use open-source tool. We also think that drones and satellites are pretty cool, and wanted to use them in order to hack world issues.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This toolkit enables users to analyze and view data from satellites and open data sources. The web dashboard allows a user to input latitude, and longitude coordinates to find soil moisture data, vegetation, and soil looseness. We also take data from Quandl to construct visualizations of food prices, farmland expenses, outputs, and productivity over time in the United States. Not only that, but we used regression algorithms to predict the price of various foods for the next five years (such as oranges, soybean, and rice - rice is good, everyone likes rice).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>AgriGate was mainly built on top of CockroachDB to store satellite and open data from the federal government. During the hackathon, we spent the majority of our time parsing Shape and H5 files before inserting it into the database. In addition, our team pieced together a webUI to display and predict the information collected.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We initially wanted to use drones to survey an area of land to recover photographic data. However, due to complications in software, we were unable to access and parse the data.

You guys have all these 'ideas' but never do anything with them, and one day, you'll forget it, and it will be lost forever.\" So for this year's hackathon we created the ultimate database for ideas and the easiest way to get inspiration. And sometimes, even if we wanted to make an idea into the next blockbuster project, we can't because maybe as a programmer we lack the skills of film making. However, this way, people from many different backgrounds and skill sets can find and give ideas to anyone else in the world.

We found that either of the APIs cannot provide the complete information that is required for the analysis and combining them will yield much more effective information. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the most difficult part of implementing this project is the searching functionality, where We need to present the most relevant result to the user despite the fact that the query is worded differently. </p>\n<p>To accomplish that, We need to come up with a rating algorithm that takes the query and one of the entries from the database and decide the relevance between the two, represented as a number. To do so, We need to think about the algorithms and data structures that We already know, and try to incorporate them into the project. </p>\n<p>After many hours of thinking, We had come up with an algorithm that uses the Maximum Weighted Bipartite Matching algorithm to try to \"pair\" the concepts in the query and the ones in the entries. The relevance score comes from both the number of matches formed as well as the similarities between those pairs. It later came out to be quite effective after some testing. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This is the first time for both of us to participate in a hackathon with a team size of 2 people. This project is also a bit more complex than the previous projects I have worked on. </p>\n<p>The greatest accomplishment for our team would be....   we finished. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Before the hackathon, Google's API (Apps Engine / Compute) seemed impossible to use because of the complexity of many aspects of the APIs, including authentication, permissions, activities, and a lot more things. Thanks to the Google booth, I have learnt and successfully implemented the Google Natural Language processing API in my application to parse the data from the users. </p>\n<p>Thanks Google :)</p>\n<h2>What's next for IdeaShare</h2>\n<p>The current algorithm for searching is a bit inefficient (O(V^2 log V)), which will run for more than 5 second when V is larger than 8700. There is currently a known way that is more efficient, but due to the lack of time as well as the difficulty of implementation of said algorithm. </p>\n<p>Given more time, we would also implement a forum system where people can vote on the quality and practicality of the ideas. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docker\">docker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/font-awesome\">font-awesome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/textrazor\">textrazor</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-natural-language-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c9</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ideashare.ml/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ideashare.ml/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ideashare.ml</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jimgao1/ideashare-java\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jimgao1/ideashare-java\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zharry/ideashare-frontend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zharry/ideashare-frontend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend where the website sends GET requests too.

Despite the push for phase 2 and beyond E911 services, they are expensive, difficult to implement, and require the modernization of both existing smartphone hardware and infrastructure. There must be a better way. </p>\n<p>EmergiCare solves this issue by presenting a low-cost, reliable, and innovative solution that can quite literally be implemented in the majority of smartphones today. Upon the initialization of emergency calls, automated services buried within the system begin to automatically send updating GPS coordinates to the operators on the other side. Notably, we offer the following advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Compatibility: It took all of 36 hours for us to make our app compatible with all smartphones Android 2.3 and above! This essentially covers all android smartphones in existence, and an iOS solution would be a simple step from there.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reliability: Our app relies exclusively on technology available during a 911 call - no data or internet connection of any kind is required. If you call, you can almost certainly text.</p></li>\n<li><p>Accuracy: Even the latest cutting-edge E911 solutions only support periodic GPS polling from the client device. Making use of the Google Play Location Services, we combine both GPS, Network, and other data to provide the fastest and most accurate data. Furthermore, our app intelligently sends data when a change in location or accuracy is detected. </p></li>\n<li><p>Ease of Use: Unlike many other past solutions, our app requires no new user interaction of any kind - call 911 like normal and the app does its thing in the background.</p></li>\n<li><p>Interoperability: Smartphone manufacturers or carriers can simply drop it in as a preloaded app. And, boom. 911 services can access this data with a simple system integration. </p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sends optimized GPS and network location by text to a specified number and simulates a routing of emergency vehicles using the Waterloo bus system to the location of a citizen in trouble.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was an interesting journey using undocumented Android APIs to listen for outgoing phone calls.

We then further established database tables to map word relationships and line relationships. For example, our database stored data on common word pairs, common words in preceding lines of a word, common sentence structures, etc.</p>\n<p>We used python to build Markov chains that likelihood of certain words following other words, similar to Swiftkey\u2019s predictive text. By feeding our Azure SQL database the lyrics of the artists with which we want to base our rap on, our Markov chains become unique to that set of lyrics. </p>\n<p>We defined the grammar used for the songs using parse trees (an ordered collection of Nouns, Verbs and Adjectives) built on top of the nltk library and connected our algorithm to Microsoft Azure's Web Language Model API. We also used common parse trees that were found in our dataset. We generated rap lines by conforming our Markov chains to valid parse trees.</p>\n<p>From there, we seeded Azure\u2019s algorithm with our generated sentences to add more vocabulary from the internet in the same style. Azure\u2019s API was also used for validation and ensured only the sentences that made the most sense were used in our rap.</p>\n<p>As for syncing the lyrics to the music, we used librosa to extract onset (key pitch and beat changes) features from the track. Using this data, we used an edge detecting algorithm and found the time differences between each onset in order to identify the timestamps chorus and the verses. Using that data, we use linux\u2019s espeak to write the text-to-speech of our lyrics into .wav files with their timestamps as their filename. The speed of the speech was determined by the length of the verse relative to the timestamp it was allocated to. Once completed, we grafted every generated text-to-speech .wav onto the base beat to generate a new overlaid wav file which we converted to mp3.</p>\n<h1>Challenges we ran into</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Database issues...

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Currently in virtual reality you can stimulate two senses, sight and sound. Our goal was to bring a third sense, touch, into the realm of VR at a relatively low cost. The result was Third Sense, a Virtual Reality Haptic Feedback Vest. </p>\n<p>Right now in VR/games you can interact with the environment, but the environment can not interact with players which is a massive barrier to immersion. Third Sense solves this by being a platform upon which developers can create meaningful environments that immerse players like never before.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Third Sense is a haptic feedback vest that stimulates real world interactions within VR. Third Sense is a platform allowing game developers and software designers to have environments that interact with the players. This increases immersion and allows for truly immersive experiences. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The feedback in the vest is powered by 16 vibration motors, an Arduino Mega, and a PWM breakout board which allow for different vibration levels per motor. While the vest itself is built off commercial motorcycle armor, used as a quick mounting solution since it provided a basic frame for mounting the electronics and motors.</p>\n<p>The VR headset we used was the Oculus Rift DK2 powered by the Unity Engine. Unity was used as our game engine and integration with the hardware was done through a serial port in C# with a stateless RPC interface to the Arduino Mega. This C# library is extendable to other unity projects/games as a drag and drop class.</p>\n<p>In order to determine the position of each limb of the player for collision calculations the Microsoft Kinect was used. This allowed us to know which points on a player\u2019s body to stimulate upon contact from an in game object. This allowed for a high level of immersion since we accurately knew where each limb would be in the game and how it would interact with the games environment.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge was getting the Kinect to interact properly with the Oculus Rift. Both systems have their own space references, so getting them to cooperate was rather tricky.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>We are proud of finishing the project and having a working demo. Both the hardware and software components are able to communicate effectively to create an heightened interactive experience. This project was ambitious, bringing in multiple different experimental technologies and custom hardware, which is always a tricky combination.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Third Sense</h2>\n<p>Third Sense is right now just an upper body solution, but we would love to extend our project to also include the lower half of the body for an even better experience. We would also like to try and integrate temperature and more powerful motors into the vest in the future.</p>\n<p>If you are still at Hack the North, please feel free to find us and ask for a demo!

This functionality adds to the travel app, allowing for a clean and easy interface served with an intuitive user experience, all within an arm's reach (literally).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We integrated XE's API for all currency conversions, along with Zomato's API to retrieve information about nearby restaurants and relevant data associated with them. We used Javascript to implement Pebble.js' user interface along with the backend logic communicating between the watch and the phone. We used Node.js and javascript for the API's and our App.js. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>None of us have done a hardware hack before so experimenting the pebble watch and its functionalities was the most tricky, yet, best learning experience.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Our first hardware hack!!!!!!</li>\n<li>Have fully functioning front end &amp; back end </li>\n<li>We slept for more than 2 hours!! zzzzz......</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Pebble watch</li>\n<li>XE's well documented API</li>\n<li>Furthered our knowledge in javascript &amp; node.js</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Pubble</h2>\n<p>Keep working on it on the side to improve complexity of the app &amp; add new features!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xe-currency-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JackLinUWaterloo/Pubble\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JackLinUWaterloo/Pubble\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Choosr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Choosr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/077/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>enter your name</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Choosr \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/074/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>create or join a room</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Choosr \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/082/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>search for and add suggested restaurants</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Choosr \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/078/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>vote on your preferences</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Choosr \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/076/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>ranking algorithm determines the most suitable restaurant</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Too many times in our (young adult) lives we face the daunting challenge of promptly deciding on where to eat when going out with a group of people. Either deciding on a night out with friends who you've known for years or an introduction dinner with other students at a new internships, we've all faced the \"I'm fine with anything\" and \"I'm not feeling sushi\" messages that inevitably get thrown around almost endlessly within a large group chat. Rather than argue back and forth endlessly with each other and god forbid, repeating yourself for the tenth time to the individual who arrived late with a quick \"wait guys what's going on\", Choosr is made in mind of quickly providing an environment where groups of people can quickly and concisely decide on a simple dinner plan.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Choosr provides a platform where a group of individuals can easily create a voting environment to quickly and fairly decide on a restaurant choice for an event. The Choosr process for the user can be broken down into two phases: the input and ranking phase. In the input phase with the help of the Yelp API, users are able to search for the names of restaurants and a list of matching restaurant names as well as their location will be added to a pool that will be used in the voting phase. Once all restaurant suggestions are locked in, the voting process phase begins. In this phase, the users are able to rank the choices in a simple preference system: 'Down', 'Meh' and 'Naw'. Once the voting process finishes, a Schulze ranking algorithm will decide on the top result and display this to the group.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Choosr is built with Python/Flask and SQLLite3 on the back end, with React running on the front end. Git was also used as a version control system durring its development.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>While the majority of our team has working Python knowledge, none of us were especially familiar setting up our own database. Therefore we've spent the longest time developing the schemas used for the database and testing the functionality of creating users and rooms. </p>\n<p>In addition, another challenge we've come across is trying to have the application ran on a standalone URL. We've looked into many website hosting services such as Azure, AWS, and Heroku, but again the lack of experience really hurt us here. After trying to get it up with running with these services and failing, we decided to rather use the man power to finish up the app than try to get it hosted. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The biggest accomplishment that we are proud of is actually getting the application to run. Actually seeing a product that we visualized come to life sparks a feeling that we cannot even describe. </p>\n<p>Another big accomplishment for us is finally figuring out the schemas used in the backend. As discussed before, our team was not familiar with databases so getting the final product where it is was quite the large accomplishment for our team.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Since this Hack the North is the first Hackathon for the majority of our members, we have learned many things in terms of planning, designing, and developing our very own webapp. We've learned the hard way of dealing with issues such as differences across operating systems, wonky dependancies, and merge conflicts - just to name a few. However despite this, team moral was high and we've learned that perseverance is one of the most important factors when it comes to building an app. </p>\n<p>On a more serious note, we have also learned that trying to deploy our webapp on AWS through multiple pages of tutorials while running on minimal sleep is a very difficult thing to do. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Choosr</h2>\n<p>The first step for Choosr after this Hackathon is for it to be hosted on an external server. Our vision of a centralized place of easy group decisions obviously need to be expanded outside of the app simply running on a local machine. In addition, mobile apps for both Android and iOS can be created in order to provide the younger generation with a quicker way to access our app - thus a quicker way to decide on a place to eat.</p>\n<p>In terms of features, Choosr can definitely be expanded to not cover only restaurants, but provide a quick choice selection for a myriad of other group activities, such as movie or board game recommendations. In these scenarios, we will have to branch out from the Yelp API in order to find more specialized recommendations for these specific activities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yelp\">yelp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">schulze-method</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/johnbwu/HackTheNorth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/johnbwu/HackTheNorth\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Stress Radar", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stress Radar \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/735/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Red indicates potentially triggering places; purple indicates places that experience criminal activity</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There are a number of different symptoms and treatment strategies for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); while a full description of each is beyond the scope of this project, one of the hardest symptoms to overcome is that of avoidance. It is often easier to avoid a potential or triggering environment than to face it, but facing triggers is ultimately the only way to diminish their importance (as well as the problems avoidance causes). </p>\n<p>It is often the unexpected events and situations that are the hardest to cope with-- one minute an environment is stable, and the next it's full of triggers. Avoiding all difficult situations is the wrong answer since doing so makes things worse, but it is also important to be able to pick one's battles.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Since it is difficult to tell what an environment is like from a map or even from standing outside and looking in, we use reviews written by people and submitted to Yelp. Using the text of the reviews we can use sentiment and emotional analysis to find the reviews that indicate that the author was feeling certain emotions when writing the review of a place. Often, the emotions of fear and anger that can be identified in Yelp reviews are similar to the same emotions that accompany PTSD symptoms.  By identifying locations that might be triggering we offer an option for someone to PTSD to compare the emotions they are feeling at a location to those of other people, and make a more rational decision in responding to those emotions.</p>\n<p>This is similar to the process used to treat PTSD, involving mindfulness and cognitive processing therapy to challenge the assumptions that PTSD introduces in response to stimuli.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our primary data source was Yelp, specifically the data available at yelp.com/dataset_challenge. Shamya used Python to filter the Yelp data to extract the text of reviews of each place, and then pass the reviews to the IBM Alchemy API for sentiment and emotional analysis. \"Fear\" was a major factor in identifying reviews of places where review authors felt strong emotions that would apply to someone experiencing PTSD symptoms at the same location.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There are over 2.7 million reviews in the dataset offtered by Yelp; student-class laptops turned out to be not quite fast enough, and we rapidly reached the transaction limits of the Alchemy API. Ideally we'd like to be able to make information available on all of the locations listed in Yelp's data so that the application would work anywhere that has had Yelp reviews written for it. For this weekend, we had to limit the data we used to a specific location (Las Vegas NV) to be able to process enough to display meaningful output reasonably quickly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Using existing data in a new way-- although Yelp reviews are meant to only describe individuals experiences at businesses and other places, they can include other information that can be useful. Alchemy allowed us to see Yelp's reviews differently and apply the result to a problem that affects many people, including (but certainly not limited to) military veterans. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>You can't put 2.7 million reviews into an API that only lets you process 1,000 requests at a time without making some changes to your approach. Maybe we knew that already though.</p>\n<p>In our planning discussion, and in deciding how to display data and what functions to include, the problem of displaying the results of applying machine learning and analysis to text data is a deep and complicated one. We used a heatmap to illustrate our data, but the colors used and how they appear on a map made a difference between useful information and just showing dots on a map.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Stress Radar</h2>\n<p>Still working on adding the button to allow a user to add how they're feeling at a particular location; this input will be used as another input to calculating the score a location receives. More coding needed to finish the auto adjustment that will happen if people indicate they feel non-stressed at a location that the Yelp reviews or open crime data indicate are potentially triggering. The idea is to maximize the amount of available human input as a check against inaccuracy in the results of processing the Yelp reviews.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yelp\">yelp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/alchemyapi\">alchemyapi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">opendata</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/airmanopus/HackTheNorth2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/airmanopus/HackTheNorth2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.airmanopus.net/hackthenorth2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.airmanopus.net/hackthenorth2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.airmanopus.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the machine learning and data processing part of this problem.

Wether for academic or industrial reasons, upcoming surgeons have barely any information to look at when learning how to do a specific surgery. We made Project Open Heart to provide an opportunity to develop a better understanding of what techniques an methods to use in a surgery and ultimately lock in the concepts/surgical steps through VR.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We provide a full system to a legitimate surgery. The first part of the system is our \"Nurse,\" Alexa. Alexa helps us retrieve specific tools necessary for our surgery. Through simple requests such as, \"bring me the scalpel,\" Alexa responds by adding a scalpel to your hand in the virtual reality atmosphere. The second part is connecting with the oculus and actually being hands-on with the entire surgery experience. We provide recordings of the surgery so other people can analyze mistakes and show others how the specific surgery is conducted. There is also the feature to record your actions and save them to a file. This file can then be played back at a later date for you or others to see how you performed and what you did. Lastly, you can stream your surgery to any others who want to watch it with our setup. Using firebase, we can sync data between the host and the clients with minimal effort.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The system has two parts: an Alexa app and a Unity app. The Alexa app leverages the firebase api, amazon lambda, and the Alexa API. Once a certain task is called, we call a function in our Alexa app to send an update to our Firebase Database. This allows for live communication between both the Nurse and Surgeon. Now moving over to the surgeon-side. We use Oculus Rift to allow a full hands on experience of an open heart surgery we used 3d models to show a human body: including skin, flesh, bone, and organs. We attached a Leap Motion to the oculus to allow us to track the hand movements when performing a certain gesture in the surgery. When eventually synced with Firebase, we allow for more accessibility of the surgery performed and that is also done through the Unity application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Sending http requests through alexa was a pain, huge shout out to the Google employees helping us out through that. Acquiring 3d models to use was not an easy task, most of them are extremely expensive. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were excited when we knew that we had a cohesive entire system, from recordings to surgical simulations, rather than just building one part. We were also proud of creating something that we both know will be used one day. There has been a problem for centuries of knowledge between hospitals and surgeons not being sent to each other. Project Open Heart, bridges the gap and truly allows others to learn about the surgery and practice it hands-on</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to program for Alexa, though it was a complete pain. We had to learn how to also efficiently utilize our threads in the Unity app. Pushing data from Alexa to firebase was also a great thing we learned and debugged to get right.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project Open Heart</h2>\n<p>We want to implement a machine learning layer on top of the Unity application to allow for robust completion of the surgery without humans. We also want to leverage the fact that this application is very unique. Since this project expands to a vast amount of market, we would love to take advantage of that and present this application accordingly.

If we could accomplish this, then nfinite.space could theoretically offer it's users with near infinite space, with no overhead cost of maintaining expensive datacenters.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users can upload files, and instead of hosting those files on the server, the server breaks up the file into many chunks, duplicates those chunks for redundancy, and distributes them across connected peers hard-drives. Later, when the user requests their file from the server, the server simply calls the peers that have the file-chunks, and reassembles the file on the server, then sending the file back to the user. \nBy having multiple copies of the same file-chunks stored across multiple different peers, we can ensure that even if one peer containing a certain file chunk does offline, the user would still be a able to get their file back.</p>\n<p>Each user starts with 5GB of cloud storage, and if they want more, they have 2 options:\n1) purchase more storage\n2) offer up some of their storage to nfinite.space, in exchange for a multiple of that space in the cloud (e.g.: 1gb locally = 10gb)</p>\n<p>With nfinite.space, our mantra is \"give a little, get a lot\"</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our server-side is written in <strong>Go</strong>, with <strong>CockroachDB</strong> for storing important metadata, but <em>no user files are ever stored on the backend.</em> \nOur web-client is a <strong>React</strong> app.\nWe run on <strong>AWS</strong>. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Complex logic for handling file-splitting &amp; recombination server-side. </li>\n<li>Websockets on both the client and server were tricky at first, especially since the server was in Go, and the client was JS.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>At this point, we have a fully-functional, scalable, and extensible backend and frontend for Nfinite.space</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to use CockroachDB, which we've never used before. \nHow to write server-side services in Go. \n(At least for one of us) How to write React</p>\n<h2>What's next for Nfinite.space</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Performance and encryption improvements. </li>\n<li>Having the server inform the client about which other clients are storing their files and then using WebRTC for a BitTorrent-like P2P download, instead of having a central server do all the file splitting / recombination. </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Melinysh/nfinite.space\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Melinysh/nfinite.space\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote entire backend with Go, interfaced with CockroachDB, and handled all deployments to AWS.", "Came up with the idea, developed part of the server-client protocol, and wrote / heavily cleaned up a bunch of React ", "Worked on setting up connections between our front end and backend - build out several frontend react components and core routing system for the website."]], ["BountyPhish", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BountyPhish \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/795/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Phishing Attack Report</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BountyPhish \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/998/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Phisher Profile + Org Directory</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>BountyPhish is a premier social engineering bounty program.

It would certainly make Tinder a very interesting group activity. Realizing that Yelp was present at Hack the North, we realized that this revolutionary concept could be also used for choosing restaraunts among friends, and so Lezzeat was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Lezzeat helps people to decide where they want to eat. When you are hanging out with a group of friends and not sure where to eat, Lezzeat provides a solution. It is a web app that can scan the restaurants nearby and hold a toll among a group of friends. After simply swiping out the restaurant options you don't want, and Lezzeat automatically ranks the best 3 choices for you to decide.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our mobile web app using Ruby-on-Rails as a full stack framing-work. Using Yelp-API we retrieve the data and extract the information needed in an industrial standard database as the back-end. The front-end is established using material design on embedded Ruby.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning new language and new framework and apply them to actually build a complete project is the greatest challenges we have. For example, figuring out the polling (to ensure the client-side updates the information in a timely manner), learning Ruby-on-Rails as well as Yelp-API and material designing for the front-end.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We finally are able to complete the working prototype of the project that we propose. Most importantly, we all enjoyed this team-hacking experience.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As what we have mentioned above, we all have obtained a lot of experience in web design using Ruby-on-Rails and material design. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Lezzeat</h2>\n<p>Improving the UI and speed up the process of voting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yelp\">yelp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">faye</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ec2-54-69-231-151.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ec2-54-69-231-151.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ec2-54-69-231-151.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Storyboarding and front-end designing using material design and simple html", "I worked on designing the front end with embedded ruby and materialize css.", "", ""]], ["Recur", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Recur \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/495/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Recur \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/489/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Recur \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/490/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Recur \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/491/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Recur \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/492/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Recur \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/493/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Recur \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/494/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When you are sharing a flat or a Spotify subscription with other people, don't you find annoying having to ask them for the money every month?

We thought that we could implement a flocking algorithm in a simple game to make it look nice.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a simple WebGame coded in JavaScript where the goal is to survive as long as possible. You control the leader boid (green) with the arrows and to survive, you need to always have follower boids (white) around you. The white boids follow you with swarm intelligence but they might escape your flock if you're going too fast or too slow. There are obstacles (red circles) which kill your followers or yourself if there is a collision and pieces of food (green circles) which will increase your score to let you spawn other followers around you (space bar).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used JavaScript with the library p5.js which is really well built to handle vectors and graphics (what we used the most)</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>At first, we wanted to code our flocking algorithm on our own and ran into lots of balance problems with the coefficients and decided to borrow the code for our Boid class from the p5.js example, we modified it afterward so that it can be used in the game.\nAfter having the boids on our screen, we still weren't sure what kind of game we wanted to code and we decided to develop this one and a pong clone (implementing boids). We only kept this one on our submission. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our game looks nice !\nOur logo too !</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>p5.js is a really cool library for basic stuff but we ran into so much problems to use it in our code that it was a waste of time after all.

All the members of our team had similar experiences coming to a new city. That is why we have decided to develop an app that will assist newcomers, tourists, as well as Torontonians in choosing the perfect area for living in Ontario's capital city.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Best Neighbourhood is a web app that is created to help users find the perfect neighbourhood for living depending on their preferences. At this point the app covers only Toronto and includes all neighbourhoods within the city. Users have the option to choose a particular area while taking into consideration what is most important to them (e.g. public safety, transit, health, access to amenities, recreational areas, etc.). Depending on your priorities the app displays the best areas that match your criteria. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>CODX service provides tons of valuable information that can be effectively used in many spheres of our life. We used it to retrieve and analyze about 70 data sets, we designed the app to cover the most requested features. We have also used Google Maps API to make the app more interactive and to provide visual presence. In addition to using above mentioned services, we used NodeJS for backend, and ReactJS for front-end. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Access to a large volume of information required spending a lot of time analyzing the data and deciding how this data can be efficiently used in the app. Analyzing and parsing of the data was a big challenge, especially given that we had a tight deadline to accomplish \"Best Neighbourhood\" and familiarize ourselves with the extensive features of Google Maps.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are really proud of designing a user-ready app within 36 hours. This is definitely a big accomplishment for me. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We used Cockroach DB for the first time, that was a definitely new skill. Also, Google Maps API was interesting.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Best Neighbourhood</h2>\n<p>We would like to improve our app using additional data available at CODX and incrementally adding more features that can improve users' experience working with our app. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cockroach-db</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material-ui</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bestneighbourhood.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bestneighbourhood.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bestneighbourhood.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BestNeighbourhood/BestNeighbourhood\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BestNeighbourhood/BestNeighbourhood\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was responsible to setup Linode Server, CockroachDB, as well as worked with CODX data(retrieving, parcing).

But many visionaries like Elon Musk have expressed warnings over how Artificial Intelligence can become a threat. We feel that the best way is to get the most eyes on this technology before it gets out of hand. So we decided to combine Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things to build Mirror.ai.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mirror.ai takes in data from a multitude of sources like Yelp, XE, and Twitter and learns more about the user. The user can talk, and interact with mirror.ai better than any technology before it.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Group chats can get extremely long \u2013 and when you return to a chat after missing several hundred messages, scrolling through the clutter to find the relevant information can be a trying task. Context Chat is designed to be a smart messaging platform designed to solve this problem. Created specifically with online group chats in mind, Context Chat allows users to create and join group chats at givecontextto.me. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The power of Context Chat lies in its summarizing functionality: for users just logging in to a group chat, or for users who may just wish to view the important points of what was said, Context Chat goes through the chat history and finds which messages are important \u2013 these messages are then conveniently displayed in a sidebar for the user. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The actual mechanics of determining which messages to show rely on a heuristic scoring system based on results from Google Cloud Platform\u2019s Natural Language Processing API. The system accounts and weights several factors, including sentence complexity, mention of entities, proximity to earlier questions, and elapsed time. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Throughout the event, we were faced with two main problems. The first was incorporating our different ideas and tasks given the very little time limit that we had. The second problem was synchronizing our working environments together. Hack the North was the first time we all met each other so we had little awareness of each others capabilities, weaknesses and strengths. As the each of us worked on different components of the project, there was various delays when trying to connect our components together. For an example, setting up the database took longer than expected and the back-end side of the program could not continue working without getting sample data sets to test the logic. However, despite these challenges, we all held a positive mindset and team dynamics was positive at all times ensuring we could all work to the best of our abilities.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of being able to manage to incorporate the different sections of our work together completing our core goals in the time limit that we had. Our goal at the start of the Hackathon was to learn new skills and take at least one skill away from the event. We decided to work on APIs that we have never used before(Google Cloud API and Cockroach) to accomplish these goals and challenge ourselves. We are proud to say that all four us have definitely taken away more than just one skill from the program. We all worked in areas that capitalized on our strengths while also touching onto other group members works to gain a better understanding of the different components of our program.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned to trust each others capabilities and not shy away from asking questions when stuck solving a difficult question. Overall we have walked away from the event with not only better technical skills but also improved team-working  a different mindset.</p>\n<h2>Whats next for Context Chat</h2>\n<p>Future work on Context Chat would focus on refining the message selection algorithm \u2013 most likely using machine learning on a set of training documents to determine the ideal weights for the different factors.

I aim to solve that by using smart contracts to guarantee that the money flows incrementally into the project, and never up front.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>CrowdTrust is a startup-funding platform for startups willing to accept funding in Ether based on Smart Contracts. That means that in order for some amount of money to be released to a startup, a milestone needs to have been achieved by the founders. In a hardware project, for example, money for a 3D printer only comes after founders pushed software source code to Github for example. I've written a Ethereum contract model that startup founders are able to modify and compile. They then post the address of their contract to the platform, to which people are able to send digital currencies(Ether, for now) to.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Ethereum and Solidity to write the contract itself and an online platform to compile it. To build the project reddit-like tracker I used NodeJS/ExpressJS and the usual Bootstrap for frontend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Understanding how Ethereum contracts work, how they're written and how they spread through a network took a long time. Also, since it is a very new technology, tools aren't in their best form yet, so it is kind of tricky using them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>After completely giving up on everything, I went to get some ice cream 4 in the morning only to come back and realise that the contracts are written in a language kind of close to my beloved Java. After that I got really excited and was able to finish the project</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>A lot about digital currencies and P2P networks. Guys at @Coinbase were really really helpful, so I learned a lot about Ethereum in a really short amount of time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CrowdTrust</h2>\n<p>I built it with startup investing in mind, but I got carried away with the technology and ended up also writing a extension for government projects too, providing an alternative way for the population to fund government projects apart from trusting them directly with tax money.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ethereum</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solidity</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://localhost.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://localhost.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>localhost.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["GPD Sliding Cannon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GPD Sliding Cannon \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/215/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GPD Sliding Cannon \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/216/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This was influenced from an exercise I did in college from the 10th edition of Daniel Liang's Introduction to Java Programming, where it was some kind of game to be built with the Java Swing and AWT packages.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a one-level, simple phone-based game where all you do is take down a bunch of enemies and destroy them all before they destroy you. *<em>You need a gyroscope built into your phone to build this.

I ran into some trouble with the accelerometers, so upon reading one forum post, someone mentioned about the use of gyroscopes. So I decided to experiment with it on my Nexus 5 phone.

But otherwise, I think I have a suitable level on this project to upload and present it to my connections I have from Nintendo's development program, which holds the resources needed to build games for the Wii U and 3DS.

What we wanted to do was develop a new system which facilitates online discussion in a way that will lead to a potential solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Interwebs system is designed to encourage people to solve problems using the method of <strong>'parallel thinking'</strong> / De Bono's 6 thinking hat philosophy, as opposed to an argumentative philosophy which can lead to frustration, and has been proven not to be the most effective way of coming to a solution (especially in large groups).</p>\n<p>Dr. Edward De Bono's 6 thinking hats: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ew6h5nHcc\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ew6h5nHcc</a></p>\n<p>The system's front end is a giant web of nodes, which can be manipulated through a myo band. Each node represents and idea that someone has added to the discussion. Each node is classified to one of De Bono's six thinking styles/'hats' (visually they are color coded). </p>\n<p>This setup allows users to understand how the discussion has progressed overtime, and also encourages people to add information like 'intuition and emotion' (De Bono's red hat), which is valuable information that is not used in the classic argumentative philosophy. Also, the myo provides a interactive way to use the web. </p>\n<p>Users are also able to easily rate how much they like a node, through simple myo gestures. As a node increases in popularity, the node gets bigger in size. When a chain of nodes start to become very dominant on the web, then that chain of ideas is the solution to the problem that was being discussed. </p>\n<p>As Edward De bono once put it, if the system is used properly, the solution will present itself.</p>\n<p>(NOTE: A myo script was developed which allows myo to control the web's interface)</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>flask and mongodb was used for backend.</p>\n<p>css3 &amp; html5 was used for front end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Several bugs were encountered on the way. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>The system required a lot of coding, which got tedious at times. This is why we are happy that we got a working model which consisted of most features we wanted to add. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Having more people on a hackathon team helps get work done faster :)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Interwebs</h2>\n<p>Our next steps would be to add machine learning to the web as a method of coming up with a solution, which would be based off of information and responses from users. </p>\n<p>In the future, we envision that this system will gradually replace current methods of online discussion. We feel that people will respond positively to the constructive thinking philosophy of Edward De Bono, which will make people want to use our system architecture more than other argumentative based discussion systems that exist today.</p>\n<h2>Special Thanks</h2>\n<p>We would like to thank Myo &amp; Thalmic Labs for there support in helping us create this project. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["marketing & little front end, came up with idea.", "Whole of server side, almost all of front end, idea conception and more."]], ["Pathways", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We're 1A freshmen, and it's always hard getting around the new campus.

A probing cane certainly helps by identifying obstacles in the way, but the information transmitted back to the user is simply limited. For one thing, the obstacles could any object or thing. Not to mention that the probing cane can only reach so far. </p>\n<p>Knowing people around us who are visually impaired, although they are very independent on their own, they are still much more comfortable with personal guidance because we can provide them with more descriptive information when it comes to navigating. This inspired us to develop a smart technology that can provide the same visual description as if it is from someone who has regular vision. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>YouEye monitors the visual environment straight ahead and sends descriptive visual speech guidance to the user informing the user exactly what the obstacle is and its distance from the user. As the user is walking, the camera constantly takes screenshots ahead which are analyzed through google-visualization to identify the obstacle in the screenshots. The distance and description of the object are then sent back to the user as speech feedback in real time. Depending on the distance of the object, YouEye would give different warning or feedback. If the object is 5 meters away, YouEye would inform the user the pathway is all clear. As the distance of the object ahead decreases below 5 meters, the feedback message escalates from caution and finally warning message while providing the description of the obstacle and its distance away from the user. This way, the user is well aware of their surroundings to make more accurate judgments of their actions when they are traveling anywhere, anytime. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a camera to take consistent photos which can be analyzed through google-visualization to identify the top two likely labels for the object in the photo. With the help of an ultrasonic sensor connected to an Arduino, we are also able to measure the distance between the user and the obstacles ahead. All the information collected is then transformed to a speech feedback for the user in real time to provide accurate guidance and navigation when the user is moving. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into several challenges while building our project. The first challenge being finding a java interface for the Arduino so we can incorporate the information collected from our ultrasonic sensor to our java program which contains the google-visualization API to analyze the label of the object in the photos. Then, we had to synchronize the distance feedback from the sensor with the photos taken by the camera to make the information we collect from the two sources are accurate and in real time. Finally, we had to incorporate an API to convert our summarized information to a speech form in real time to make sure the user is getting accurate feedback without delay. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud to have achieved the original goals and functionalities we have designed for YouEye. YouEye is able to generate fast and accurate information from two different sources and combine the pieces into useful information. The output of YouEye is simple and easy to understand, which was our intention when we processed complicated information in the back-end because we wanted to make the information in a very presentable way to the user to make the use of YouEye as convenient as possible.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We had a deeper understanding of how difficult it is to navigate ahead without a visualization of the environment. It is difficult to process the photos and distance information at the same time and in real time and a lot of effort is involved in providing an accurate feedback to the user.</p>\n<h2>What's next for YouEye</h2>\n<p>For the next steps, we hope to present even more accurate information to the user. Currently, YouEye only gives feedback on what the object is, we would like to add more descriptive features such color, size and more specific warning. </p>\n<p>We would also like to generate more complete pictures of the environment ahead of the camera. YouEye can currently identify objects straight ahead but has some difficulty identifying obstacles such as water and smaller objects on the ground as well as obstacles above. Our goal is to provide a guidance device that analyze the environment in an 360 degrees perspective that the user can be fully comfortable of using.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-visualization\">google-visualization</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SSShawnJ/hackTheNorth2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SSShawnJ/hackTheNorth2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Dressr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dressr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/003/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>logo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Humans are always busy. Humans are also always wearing clothes (at least in public).

We miss out on awesome sales on must-buy jeans. Or worse! We fail to have the latest trending clothing in our closets. This problematically causes us to spend money on repeat/unnecessary clothing purchases, or clothes that do not coordinate with our existing outfits. Luckily, Dressr provides an innovative and convenient approach to such problems.</p>\n<p>Dressr is a mobile and web application that allows users to organize their closets on digital platforms.

Therefore, we thought of an idea which takes away the tediousness from donating money to those in need. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Probono is a revolutionary new idea to <strong>make donating simple</strong>. We combined the power of subscription based services with charities to give you the optimum experience to donate what you want, to who you want on a monthly basis!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript created on the Cloud 9 IDE for easy collaboration. In order to get our login authentication to function, we had to utilize the FireBase console along with the Google Authentication API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since we were completely new to Firebase, we found it extremely difficult to get the authentication to work with our app. This took one team member several hours to figure out even with the amount of tutorials online.</p>\n<p>Another challenge was making the check-out system from grabbing the total value to integrating it with PayPal. This was not extremely hard to overcome but it took a lot of our time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>One of the best thing is how well designed our app is. It looks good along with being responsive due to Bootstraps and the CSS @media selector. </p>\n<p>We are also really proud of our authentication because we got it working despite all the problems that we had to face.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned many new things as high schoolers who are still relatively new to the world of hacking. In school, all we have learned is HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We did not learn how to use APIs or Firebase. This was all new and was a challenge we had to face. </p>\n<p>We also learned how to collaborate in a group to accomplish a project like this. Normally, we would work on personal projects and collaboration was not something we did often.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Probono</h2>\n<p>The plan for the future of Probono is to implement a better checkout system and a stronger authentication system. Probono will also require a strong database which can be made with Firebase.

Once you receive results, you may view the full review for the results on Yelp, get directions from Google Maps, or make a reservation at a restaurant, all directly from Messenger.</p>\n<p>You can also pass the chatbot your location, and it will prompt you with a menu to quickly find coffee shops, restaurants, and bars in your area.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The chatbot was built with Node.js, and communicates to the users with the Messenger Send API. The messages received using the Send API are first interpreted by Wit.ai to determine the appropriate context, and then further handled with the Yelp API.

It was a very tedious and boring task. We want to fix that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Divide and Conquer is an application that uses AI, specifically NLP, to ease the research process. We allow users to recieve aid with their research by giving the users potential sources and images. For example, if someone is researching about Lenz's Law, he or she would begin by typing about a sentence before Divide and Conquer comes to rescue. Divide and Conquer then gives the user images that corroborate the idea of Lenz's Law and it would give scholarly articles that investigate it. This allows the user to access high quality research materials without the need for strenous research. Divide and Conquer will be there for your whole research process to guarantee the most efficient use of your time, allowing you to make time for your personal needs. </p>\n<h2>How it works technically</h2>\n<p>We take a summary of what the user has typed so far and query it into Google Custom Search Engine API while providing an array of relevant content. Once we retrieve all the relevant content, we filter the content by using uClassify API. (At first we attempted to use a LDA topic modelling algorithm, but we ran out of time to train a model). We then store all the content in a 3-node CockroachDB cluster on Docker. We do this to ease the time load on the program and to ease the strain on our query limits on Google. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We separated into two groups - two frontend and two backend. On the frontend, we used Angular.js and Materialize. For the backend, we used Python, specifically Flask, and used the nltk library. We also used CockroachDB to store the results of API queries in order to save time when the next query is made. In addition, we used the uClassify API for LDA topic modelling (temporary replacement for an actual model). Also, we used Google's Cloud Natural Language API to do syntax analysis as well as Google Custom Search Engine API to crawl the web. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integration of frontend and backend together.

rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>!</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>According to Gallup, Americans trust in mass media is at an all time low. While this seems alarming, it\u2019s not all that surprising. Recent revelations of Hillary Clinton working with Google to modify search results and Facebook content being unfavorable to conservatives highlight the dangers of consuming news from individual media organizations. While it is ultimately the responsibility of the user to consume information responsibly, the current digital environment has resulted in an abundance of information, which makes accomplishing this very difficult.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>N Combinator is a multi-document summarizer, which combines perspectives from various articles into a single summary. The overall goal is to reduce bias and provide users with more \u201ccomplete\u201d news.</p>\n<h2>How was it built?</h2>\n<p>N Combinator is a web app built with the Python Flask framework. It's hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and uses the Python newspaper package to extract and summarize individual news articles from the web. We use both the Google Cloud Natural Language API and the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer for sentiment analysis, and then our own homebrew algorithm to aggregate the summarized articles into a new, multi-perspective and well-rounded summary.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>There were a lot of small obstacles along the way, but the most significant hurdle was actually deploying the web app on AWS EB. One of our dependencies was the <code>lxml</code> package, which depended on some external C code and so installation wasn't nearly as simple as a <code>pip install lxml</code>. The default Elastic Beanstalk behavior is to <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>, but deployment kept failing because lxml needed its dependencies. After digging into the documentation, creating a configuration file called <code>.ebextensions/python.config</code> with various YAML-formatted text instructing <code>yum</code> to install the correct packages did the trick.</p>\n<p>Once the web app was up and running, EB failed to load the <code>static</code> folder which contained all our images and stylesheets, so the site looked like a bunch of plaintext. Modifying some more EB config files didn't fix anything, because it actually wasn't broken in the first place. It took about an hour to finally stumble upon an extremely obscure StackOverflow answer with 0 upvotes, which told us that the Chrome browser extension Ghostery does not agree with Elastic Beanstalk. After disabling Ghostery, we were able to finally view the full web app. Who knew that would be the problem?</p>\n<p>Another key challenge we faced was combining the individual summaries to produce a single multi-document summary. We needed to determine a suitable method by studying literature and modifying and combining different techniques for our specific use case.</p>\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re fortunate to have come together as a team and address a real issue we all believed in, even if it was a project we knew would be challenging to complete within the time constraints. Each of us stepped outside our comfort zones and embraced the challenge of diving into a completely new field. We\u2019re proud to have successfully delivered a proof of concept of our ultimate goal while pushing ourselves to the limit throughout this weekend.</p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Our future goals include creating a query based system so that users do not have to search for similar articles themselves. We plan to continue building off our proof of concept and polishing up the overall system by incorporating additional elements into the algorithm. In addition, we hope to incorporate this engine with other services and current news platforms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-cloud-natural-language-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/requests\">requests</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncombinator.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncombinator.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.ncombinator.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Focused primarily on front-end setup/structuring, development and deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

We decided that, should we ever find ourselves at the same hackathon, we would build this microwave and show it to the world.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>As a base functionality, our microwave plays a YouTube video the same length as the time entered by the user on the microwave. This way, the user not only knows when their food is done heating, but they can be entertained for the duration of the heating. No more awkward pacing around the kitchen while waiting for your pizza!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used an Arduino UNO microcontroller to intercept the keypad data. As the user enters a time and presses \"Start\", we fetch a YouTube video of the entered length from our backend API and play it for the user!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As neither of us are electrical engineering students, we had to work extra hard to figure out the electrical components inside the microwave. And, since this is a microwave, there are no datasheets are documentation -- we had to become really good at testing and reverse engineering how it worked!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We also developed using Google Cloud for the first time, and wrote fancy Arduino code to mimic how the microwave gets keypad inputs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Smart Microwave</h2>\n<p>We had a list of additional features we wanted if we had extra time. Here are a few ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Barcode scanning</strong>, so your microwave knows what you're cooking and how to cook it</li>\n<li><strong>Remote control</strong>, to get your pizza just right as you come home</li>\n<li><strong>Tweeting</strong>, who doesn't wanna know that you just microwaved a bowl of perogies?</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile</strong>, take your video with you to the </li>\n<li><strong>Stopping only when the mug handle faces you</strong>, nobody likes reaching in the microwave for their mug!</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microwave</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PotatoTank/IoT-Microwave\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PotatoTank/IoT-Microwave\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Balera", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Balera \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/232/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We decided to break down MLB's PitchFX data, to look at per pitch type rates for Total Base creation on the Toronto Blue Jays.

We also identify keywords that allow us to display relevant flashcards from Quizlet, making learning more efficient and accessible.</p>\n<p>We've developed both Web and iOS applications that can work together. You can start on your commute on your iPhone (i.e. snapping a photo of your notes after class) and continue right where you left off at home with the comfort of a larger screen. We wanted to make the lives of those who work and study hard late in the evenings a lot easier and smarter. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Speed of Sound -- named after Coldplay, inspired by our common goal to improve education -- was built using Python for the backend and a mix of Objective-c and Swift for the iOS app. The synthetic analysis was done with Optical Character Recognition (OCP) and Natural Language Processing. We chose SQLAlchemy for the database and hosted it Linode's high performance Linux SSD servers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>OCR output can be a mess.

As Waterloo students, we all have heavy class schedules. Sometimes we only get 40 minutes before the next lecture. Often, you ask your friends to have lunch together, but the time doesn't work out, or they want to eat different things. That's when our app come into play. Users can pre-set their preferences, shake their phone, and quickly get matched with someone who also wants to eat at the same restaurant at that moment. It's a great way to learn new things, make new friends, and find a potential date in limited time. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>With our Android mobile application, users create an account and set their personal preference for which restaurant they would like to visit, what kind of people they want to talk to, and their preferred topics such as literature or music.  Then, users shake their phone to be matched to other users who also shook their phone within the last five minutes, also want to eat at the same restaurant, and have similar interests. After they get matched, we offer a chat feature to help users meet at the restaurant successfully. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We extensively used the Firebase SDK for Android. The real-time Firebase database powers the matching functionality, allowing users to find matches instantly. The chat function is also powered by Firebase's database, rapidly syncing messages between the two devices. Finally, the Firebase Cloud Messaging API is used to show a notification when a match is found.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, Firebase's query language cannot specify some complex queries in our app, and the example code provided by Firebase did not support further filtering results clientside. Instead, we simply hid the unwanted items by setting their table cells to have 0 height.\nFirebase Cloud Messaging is designed for use with a backend; however, we wanted to create an application that is purely front-end. To that end, we decided to send Cloud Messaging requests from the clientside directly. While this presents a security risk, it's suitable for a prototype.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We get it down! With everyone's collaboration within the group. Nothing can be more proud than this!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Firebase, Google platform, Android</p>\n<p>Not good enough, keep learning, keep practicing </p>\n<h2>What's next for Mingler</h2>\n<p>Build Mingler with proper architecture, add proper backend. Build more features to make the platform more stable, like reputation system.

One hobby that came up was gardening and keeping plants. As University students, this one's is particularly challenging because of our busy schedules. We wanted to build a tool to help us improve our green thumb.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using a small array of sensors which monitor the conditions of the plant (Humidity, Temperature, Light and Soil Moisture), we send that data to a web app which let's the user track the quality of life for the plant over time, and notifies them when the plant's conditions are not good. This prompts them to water it, drain it or even move it, in order to better create an environment suited for the plant.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We approached building Basyl by splitting the tasks into three parts: collecting data from the sensors, sending the data to a server, and displaying that data in a meaningful manner. We used Arduino and the Arduino IDE with four different sensors to determine the plant's health. In particular, we used temperature, humidity, photocell and soil moisture sensors. We sent the sensor data from the Arduino to a PC running a python script. The python script batched sensor data and packaged it into a POST request, which we sent to our Rails server. We used Ruby on Rails with bootstrap to provide the user with a meaningful interface for the data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Architecturally, we thought a lot about how to get the data from the Arduino to the rails server. We decided against using an ethernet shield because of the possible complications getting on the school network. Additionally, connecting to a PC through serial allowed us more control over the data through a Python script.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of the way we split up the tasks and brought them together seamlessly.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to work with sensors, design an efficient back end system, and most importantly, how to grow basil.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Basyl</h2>\n<p>Improve the user interface.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://basyl.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://basyl.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>basyl.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://basyl.ngrok.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://basyl.ngrok.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>basyl.ngrok.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["DiaBuddy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DiaBuddy \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/629/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DiaBuddy \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/636/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DiaBuddy \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/648/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>People of all ages in all parts of the world suffer from diabetes. Current patients often have trouble tracking their glucose and weight levels over time while others at times wonder if they're becoming diabetic due to recent changes in their glucose, blood pressure or weight levels. </p>\n<p>DiaBuddy, a simple web application, aims to solve this problem and make the lives of current and future diabetes patients easier. Firstly, it's machine learning engine allows new patients to enter their glucose, blood pressure and weight levels in order to predict if they're diabetic. The prediction is based on a model created using Microsoft Azure's machine learning platform, which was trained using the <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pima Indians Diabetes Data Set</a> from the \"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\". On the other hand, the application's health management system enables patients to track their diabetes levels over time using in-built graphs/charts. The application also messages important alerts and updates to users using the Twilio API. </p>\n<p>The application was built using <strong>Flask</strong> and <strong>Cockroach DB</strong> on the back-end and <strong>AngularJS</strong> on the front-end. <strong>Linode</strong> instances were used to set up multiple <strong>Cockroach DB</strong> clusters.  The machine learning model was created using a <strong>Two-Class Deep Support Vector Machine</strong> while graphs were created using the HighCharts API.</p>\n<p>The application's machine learning model, which was tested using a <strong>230</strong> row record-set, responded with an accuracy rate of <strong>78.3%</strong> and a precision rate of <strong>79.4%</strong>.</p>\n<p>Future work for this project involves using a larger training data-set, making a mobile app to track levels on the go and integrating with diabetes tracking hardware. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cockroachdb</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sadu99/diabetes-management\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sadu99/diabetes-management\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the machine learning engine and web service, API integration and other backend services.", "Worked on back end db endpoints and added some css", "I worked on writing the front end web application piece."]], ["Face It", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>FaceIt</h1>\n<h2>Inspirations</h2>\n<p>As instant messaging becomes ever so popular, the challenge of replying to multiple messages at once makes it difficult convey genuine emotions.

We built this robot to rekindle the lost spark.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This autonomous robot project is currently a Mark-1 Prototype. The robot is programmed with 3 functions-each representing Rock, Paper and Scissors and with this, it can play an unlimited amount of rounds with a human player. No human interaction is required. In further prototypes, different types of household games can be played. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Parts were built from CAD and then the parts were 3D-printed. The programming is completed via an Arduino. The code runs 3 servo motors. A main servo motor simulates the \"rocking\" action before the game is played. 2 other smaller servos control the \"fingers\" to display what the robot selects.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We are stuck at a room with a boat during the project duration. Excessively long 3D printing time. Long waiting time in the hardware stop. Ice-cream was too cold. <strong>No Myo armband available-had to improvise.</strong> Beaver tails are actually not part of the animal.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to automate a common household game! We're proud of being the one of the <strong>TOP 10</strong> (self-nominated) teams doing a hardware hack. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The servo motors are annoying. It is highly specific of its requirements to operate properly. OnShape sucks. The power of teamwork is over 999999%!! The Force is strong with Luke. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Autonomous Playmate</h2>\n<p>Mass production. We are aiming to dominate the RPS robot market in the world. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">plastic-and-wood</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">swag</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">luke-skywalker</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">10-love</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">25-skill</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">30-dedication</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">35-grit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">and-%100</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">reason-to</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">remember-the-name</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["WikiSearch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>With all the knowledge available to us on the internet, as high school students we often feel overwhelmed by the amount of information condensed in an article when doing research. Even for the simplest of inquiries, such as wondering about a celebrities' childhood or inquiring about Shakespeare's religion, we often have to scroll through pages worth of useless Wikipedia information to find the information we were really looking for. But wouldn't it be cool if there was some tool out there that allowed you to detail who/what you're inquiring about and what about it/them you want to know with only the click of a button, and be presented with the information in an easy to read and easy to copy/paste manor? If so, WikiSearch can help you do just that!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WikiSearch is a desktop application that serves you the desired Wikipedia page, in the language you want (regardless of location/language settings), with only the information you're looking for. To use it, you first press the setup button that creates a setup prompt with fields for a subject, a language, and the information you're looking for, as well as buttons that allow for error checking and randomizing of the input fields. Clicking enter on the prompt then jumps you straight in, finding the various sentences that use the keyword you input into the setup prompt and cutting every other sentence that doesn't include the keyword. That means no more lists of sources on the page that clog up the room, no more need for endless scrolling, and no extra images, links, or subtitles of subtitles to confuse you anymore. WikiSearch keeps it simple to use, keeps it easy to navigate, and keeps it nice to look at with keyword highlighting, pinch zoom, and smooth/responsive resizing.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>To build WikiSearch, I used c#.net, the setgetgo random word generator and all open source images. The main concept of it is that all the information is extracted with web browser controls, analyzed and manipulated with c#, and displayed with textboxes. Using the System.Net namespace, I was able to target the setgetgo and Wikipedia URLs, send a get request to setgetgo for random words and to Wikipedia for its HTML information, and analyze the response from Wikipedia to error check if the webpage exists. Using the System.Windows.Forums, I was able to setup panels, split containers, rich textboxes, labels, etc. to display the information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>My biggest challenge was extracting the HTML and parsing it for the relevant information.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WikiSearch</h2>\n<p>I'd like to be able to incorporate a database in my project containing the various of hundreds of languages supported by Wikipedia extracted from an excel spread sheet. I'd also like to add machine learning, synonym support, and multiple keywords at once.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/net\">.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/setgetgo-random-word\">setgetgo-random-word</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["In charge of and did everything."]], ["gesture-presenter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspirationdaf</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>dgszdfbad</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for gesture-presenter</h2>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["MoodSwing", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MoodSwing \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/414/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MoodSwing \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/412/415/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To help Jake's autistic brother to get into a better mood with music base on his facial expressions</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Play music base on your mood</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using React.js, we implemented a website that uses the laptop camera to figure out the user's current facial expression.

The internet can give information, but not the intuition needed to really play an instrument.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The UkeMaster uses an array of low power lasers to show the student where to place their fingers on the ukulele. The app communicates with the UkeMaster to allow the student to select chords they want to learn. Or even a song, where the UkeMaster will show the student how to progress through the chords. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For the hardware, we used a C.H.I.P microprocessor to control a custom 3d printed array of lasers. The C.H.I.P controls the lasers using a python script we wrote. The python script incorporated pyrebase (a Firebase python wrapper) to communicate via wifi to a database to retrieve the chords to display. \nWe also built an iOS app using swift and Firebase to control which chords to display and when to display them.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>On the software side, we needed to learn swift, firebase, and how to program an iOS app. We have never programmed with these before.\nOn the hardware side, our main challenge was to physically get the system working. The 3d printer was very useful, but due to time constraints, it was impossible to itterate. This led us to have to hack together materials to get the system working. Also, the C.H.I.P had trouble getting the libraries we needed (pyrebase), but we overcame this challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works!! We were very happy to get the iOS app working considering we've never programmed it before. We are very proud of the hardware also, because 36 hours is a very short time to physically built something as complicated as a portible laser array that can be attached to an instrument easily. We are also very proud of our use of firebase to integrate our wireless laser array to an iOS app. We also won the cup stacking competition, so we got that going for us.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Every!! How to program an iOS app. How to use firebase. How to use pyrebase. How to 3d print strong parts. How to manage our stress under time constraints. How to overcome challenges under time constraints. How to look for answers, and ask for help. </p>\n<h2>What's next for UkeMaster</h2>\n<p>We would like to add timing features so that the user can learn to play with a tempo. We would also like to have a built in tuner. The best feature we want to implement is a chord recognition system that will detect if the user is playing the right chord. This can be combined with machine learning to custom make a lesson that will focus on the individuals education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c.h.i.p.</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lasers</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ukulele</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solder</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awalke/UkeMasterv2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/awalke/UkeMasterv2\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JeffreyBarton/UkeMasterHDWR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JeffreyBarton/UkeMasterHDWR\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awalke/UkeMasterv2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/awalke/UkeMasterv2\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JeffreyBarton/UkeMasterHDWR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JeffreyBarton/UkeMasterHDWR\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the hardware, including programming the C.H.I.P in python.

People may go into emerge for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from the common cold to life threatening injuries. And very often, peoples' wait to see a doctor ranges from several minutes up to several hours.</p>\n<p>This causes Canadians much stress and inconvenience. Instead of doing something productive with their time, they are stuck in a waiting room counting down the seconds.</p>\n<p>It was clear to us that this problem was in need of a solution, and at the very least more transparency and information being delivered to the patient. This is what ER Watch aims to achieve.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application has several exciting features:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Patients can check hospitals that use ER Watch to see how long of a wait time it would be if they arrived right now (assuming the patient is of low severity)</li>\n<li>After a patient checks in, they are given an 8 character access code, which will allow them to monitor on their mobile devices how long they can expect to wait before seeing a doctor</li>\n<li>Nurses can input patients into the system, which will automatically manage a priority queue of patients, based on the severity of the patients</li>\n<li>The system utilizes machine learning, so it will more accurately estimate wait times as patients check into hospitals</li>\n<li>Patient information is kept separate between hospitals, but the estimates for each condition that the system learns about is shared between all hospitals. This will help improve estimate accuracy</li>\n<li>Nurses can mark a patient as 'Treated' once they have been seen by a doctor, indicating that it is the next patient's turn in line</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the application using NodeJS/Express, MongoDB, and Materialize. The system is hosted on Microsoft Azure, and the MongoDB database is hosted on mLab</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As can be imagined, hospitals are very complex environments with a broad range of scenarios. We set out to make a smart and accurate algorithm that predicts accurate hospital wait times for new and existing patients in the queue. This was challenging due to the shear number of factors and corner cases that can occur in a hospital. </p>\n<p>These are just some of the factors that could be to be taken into account during the calculation: Number of doctors, Class of Illness, Type of Illness, Name of Condition, Severity of illness, Current size of the queue, Patient history, Family history, Staff efficiency, Visit length as dependent on previous data associated same conditions of similar severity, etc. </p>\n<p>In the beginning we focused on creating a working prototype of the algorithm, but as time went on we realized the number of cases and factors that need to be taken into account when trying to make accurate wait time predictions. As these realizations emerged we needed to refine and update the algorithm accordingly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that our application seems to take the first step in tackling this large problem. Our calculated wait times are clear and easily accessible to anyone with access to and internet connection wherever they may be. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We gained insights into some of the challenges and unique opportunities that are present in the public health care system. We also acquired further knowledge and experience with various JavaScript frameworks.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ER Watch</h2>\n<p>There are a many things that can be improved upon, and features that can be added to the project.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The algorithm could be more complex, and take into account multiple doctors, triage stages, etc.</li>\n<li>We could better track arrival times by getting the patient to swipe their health card.</li>\n<li>The ability to view a patient's history</li>\n<li>Get the system to input the estimated wait time, rather than the nurse</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tgfischer/ERWatch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tgfischer/ERWatch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the NodeJS backend, designed/implemented the MongoDB database models, and deployed the application to Azure", ""]], ["Waitless", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCrUfEk6f80?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Waitless \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/369/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Front View</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Waitless \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/413/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Top View</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Waitless \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/417/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Another look at the circuitry</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>bad restaurant-service experience! </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It will serve tables, using an autonomous RC car that knows the location of the tables through an SVG file, that is bluetooth conncted to an android app for functionalities.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using the motor, and wheels of an RC car, and replacing the logic chip with an arduino that we  programmed to drive forwards, backwards, etc...

To aid them, somebody may help the child using hand-over-hand assistance whereby the helper places his or her hand over the child's and guides the child in the correct movements. While this is a simple solution, it may not always be best. Not all children like hand-over-hand assistance as they may not find it meaningful, motivating, or there may not be anyone around to help them. During Hack the North, we set out to solve this problem. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Duxi takes hand-over-hand assistance and transforms it such that the child could draw independently with the help of a black box system. The \"black box\" takes assistance from above the child's hands to below. Underneath its translucent screen, a 2 axis plotter printer uses magnets to guide the child's pencil or crayon. This method of assistance could provide the child with greater motivation, sense of accomplishment, and self esteem. Not to mention that there may not always be someone around to provide hand-over-hand assistance. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Duxi was built based on the Cartesio 2 axis plotter system ( (<a href=\"http://robottini.altervista.org/cartesio-low-cost-cartesian-plotter-robot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://robottini.altervista.org/cartesio-low-cost-cartesian-plotter-robot</a>), the plotter was adapted in a way to allow guidance to the user. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We've never worked with motors before! It was definitely a learning experience.

Going with a group of 7 friends, they luckily ran into 7 other people at the park looking to play. They continued playing every Monday night and the group expanded to around 40 students around their community. These new friendships would have never been possible without meeting up to play. </p>\n<p>The thought is if there is an application that raises the odds of people meeting up, then there are higher odds for people to make new friends in their community. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>GitActive uses Canada's Open Data API to get information regarding parks close to your area. Users would create events for pickup games, and people would join in. We also implemented the Yelp API to highlight restaurants close by for post sports celebrations. Machine learning was also applied to predict and create future events faster and better.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built our hack using PHP, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS hosted on AWS with leaflet.js as my go to the map. We used PHP to handle the API and to perform POST and GET requests. For the Machine Learning component, we used AzureML to perform our prediction; where we trained the machine unsupervised.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>One challenge we ran into was how to build the machine to predict the dates. We originally thought Amazon Machine Learning would be the way to go along with AWS as our cloud. Unfortunately, AML was not available on the free tier. We went straight to Python and Flask next, but all of us had no clue how we can train the machine effectively to target a few of our dataset. Next, we looked at Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, we were able to successfully train our machine. Even though we were able to train the machine, we had trouble at times with Azure. For one, we were trying to test out the API call using Python. According to a few documentations, we should use the API key, which makes sense, but when we ran it on Python 3, we got 401 error. Unfortunately, the Microsoft people were gone for the night, so we could not ask for their awesome help. After 2 hours of trying, we found out that we should have used the primary key provided instead of the API key provided, and we were able to perform a POST request on Python. Another problem was trying to perform an HTTP request with AzureML to PHP. Unfortunately, we must use an HTTPS request in order for us to be able to apply machine learning to our hack. We were also short on time, so we decided to leave our trained machine behind. </p>\n<p>Another roadblock we encountered was using git. As Nicole and Brooke have not used Git before, files were overwritten accidentally, pushing us backwards. This was also their first hackathon and we focused on learning new things instead of getting out the largest application.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>With none of us having any experience working with Machine Learning before, we were able to train a machine to successfully predict stuff for us</li>\n<li>Nicole and Brooke survived and had a blast at their very first hackathon</li>\n<li>A successful product!!!!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot this weekend. We all learned a bit on Machine Learning especially Raymond which was his main priority for the hack. For Brooke and Nicole, they had a blast learning about web development, PHP and using APIs to make a request from Lucas's API. Lucas also learnt a lot about web hosting, spinning up his first AWS node.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GitActive</h2>\n<p>Our goal is to improve this platform by implementing the finished ML before launching.\nWe also hope to use user location to further advertise nearby restaurants.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://gitactive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gitactive.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gitactive.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built the backend of gitActive, which included setting up an AWS EC2 instance, initiating cockroachDB, designing the API and general software structure of the application.

Many people get too caught up in the work and the stress of everyday life to really take time for themselves. One habit recommended by professionals is to keep track of one's emotions on a day-to-day basis, usually via a journal or diary. While this is a great idea, it is sometimes hard for people to describe their motions, whether it be due to an inconvenience in time or a difficulty in accurately describing their mood. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mood Journal is a Chrome extension that uses data taken from the webcam, the Microsoft Emotion API, and the browsing active tabs of the user to automatically generate a report of their mood for a given timeframe, with relevant browsing history included to provide context of their emotional state for a given point in time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>As a Chrome extension, it was written in mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with JavaScript handling the webcam capture and API requests. The Chrome API was used to access the webcam, set up periodic image capture, and store user data. Plot.ly was used for visualization of the emotion data, and jQuery was also heavily utilized. Analysis of the facial images used Microsoft's <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emotion API</a>.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As a team with close to zero experience with JavaScript, we ran into many problems with the asynchronous functions of the Chrome API. The approach that we were used to with languages like Java and Python were not always applicable and lead us to spend a lot of time debugging.</p>\n<p>In addition, there were many new technologies that took us some time to learn and use, including the Chrome API and Plot.ly. We did not know how versatile the API was, so we struggled with a storage solution for our data until we learned about chrome.storage. We also ran into problems using Plot.ly to graph our data. The data was loaded, but the points were not being displayed on the graph; in the end, we had to redraw the graph after it was fully loaded.</p>\n<p>Another odd problem we ran into was that the API was not returning any detected faces on a MacBook Air, while it was working for all the other laptops. After some debugging, we realized that the image capture from the webcam stream was too dark, due to the brightness adjustment of the camera after it is activated.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to have built a functional Chrome extension, given our lack of web experience. We are also very happy with the data visualization solution we came up with, and think that it might be truly effective for self-improvement. Finally, we are proud to have come up with a nice aesthetic palette for our report page.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned skills in web development; including the use of different API. For many of us, we have learned a lot about JavaScript, the Chrome Extension environment, and plot.ly and we learned how to use all of these in conjunction to use an API none of us had experience with before. Furthermore, we have also developed skills in integrating the separate work done by each member into a cohesive project. </p>\n<h2>What's next for MoodJournal</h2>\n<p>In the future, MoodJournal hopes to include more comprehensive reports and analytics on the actual scores themselves, and hopefully a way to incorporate some feedback from the user to generate better results.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rn1n3r/MoodJournal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rn1n3r/MoodJournal\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["WhatBroke", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Many people, especially university students, often rent or lease places due to school and internships.

weekend.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>K\u014dan reads the user's brainwaves via a Muse headband and then displays the data, both live and historical, on a solid web-based app. It also provides an

Python server directly interfaced with the Muse headband, preprocessing the data and depositing it into Firebase. Firebase's real-time API was used with Javascript and HTML to build the front-end displaying important information about the user's brain activity. We created a small Node.js application, hosted on Linode, which acted as a webhooks engine for Firebase, so that alerts could be triggered when certain criteria were detected. These alerts pinged a Rails server, which interfaces with Twilio in order to provide the realtime text messaging alerts.</p>\n<p>Developing the entire system with small microservices allowed each person in the group to develop in a language that they were familiar with, as well as learn with others in conjunction.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Dealing with the firehose of data coming out of the Muse headband was a challenge. It produces data points at a rate of 10Hz, for over 10 different metrics, which was all delivered to Firebase. Working with all this data was a challenge, as analyzing all this data for the warning signs of panic attacks was hard.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We built an app that has significant potential to positively affect people who have suffer from mental issues such as panic attacks, and learned a lot about new technologies in the process.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Real time data processing, low-level protocols, how to integrate many microservices. </p>\n<h2>What's next for K\u014dan</h2>\n<p>K\u014dan is a proof of concept that shows this sort of product is both viable and useful.

Once the app detects you're outside your house after a time that you set, you can swipe to call an uber to your current location from your home screen.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In addition to using Xcode and swift, this application makes use of the Uber sdk for ios to request rides and the authentication process to minimize redundant form-filling.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>With the new release of Swift 3.0, many of the dependencies did not have enough time for compatibility patches which made it very difficult to write legacy code  in the new Xcode which also had a rather convoluted way of compiling in Legacy code.

Self-driving cars, mobile phones, the internet - they all make life more convenient, efficient, and easy. Our goal is to create an app that integrates into life seamlessly and introduces you to features you never thought you needed so that we can make your life more convenient.</p>\n<h3>What it does</h3>\n<p><em>distl</em> provides the client with a \u201cdistilled\u201d version of articles as they browse the web. The client has to do very little - <em>distl</em> automatically extracts relevant text from a webpage and gives back a summarized version with sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.</p>\n<h3>How we built it</h3>\n<p>There were a lot of components to our project. To extract text from a webpage in a non-disruptive and natural way, we created a beautifully designed chrome extension that quickly and efficiently extracts the relevant text (i.e. no ads!) from a webpage using the Boilerpipe API as well as HTML parsing and filtering techniques that we created. We then sent the relevant text to a node.js server hosted on Google App Engine, where we used text summarization techniques, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction to condense and compress the content as much as possible. This information is relayed back to the client, where he/she can choose to \u201cupvote/downvote\u201d the result. The upvote/downvote is sent back to our servers so that we can log the original text, resultant text, etc. for data processing later on. A CRON Job is scheduled on a VM hosted by Google Compute Engine to run Spark jobs on a Hadoop cluster to process and analyze log data for trends (i.e. average article size) so that we can improve our NLP algorithms.</p>\n<h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>\n<p>It was very difficult learning how to use the Google Cloud Platform tools as well as the APIs.</p>\n<h3>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3>\n<p>We tackled a lot of different, new technologies in just a few days. We learned about NLP, ML, big data, hadoop, cloud computing, and chrome extensions. In addition, Google Cloud Platform was a very complex but powerful service. It was difficult to understand the various components (i.e. Google storage, dataproc, app engine, compute engine, ML API's) and their use cases in the short period of time we had.</p>\n<h3>What we learned</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, we learned about a lot of technologies. However, we realized that the difficulty and scope of the project should be better taken into consideration next time. We took on too much and were VERY tired by the end of it all.</p>\n<h3>What's next for <em>distl</em></h3>\n<p><em>distl</em>'s backend is very loosely coupled with the frontend. We will consider launching different versions to other platforms (i.e. mobile) in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hadoop\">hadoop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-compute-engine\">google-compute-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mapreduce</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/web\">web</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ju-de/distl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ju-de/distl\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Pricely", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tum-k7QnuXE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pricely \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/910/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pricely \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/919/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pricely \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/911/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pricely \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/909/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Pricely for Hack the North</h2>\n<h4>Inspiration and what it does</h4>\n<p>Don\u2019t you hate it when you\u2019re at the store, and you don\u2019t know if you are getting scammed or ripped off?

For example, when I travel to Germany, I would love to understand local people better without having to study German for nights. When my mom travels to Canada, she could find herself easier in grocery stores and restaurants. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The voice translation app has two parts. The first part is turn-by-turn. User A presses to talk, presses again to stop, and then the phone speaks the translated version out so that user B understands. The other part is real time between two users (devices) as if they are talking on the phone. The app constantly listens to you and speaks out the result when it has it.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use the new Speech framework in iOS 10 to recognize speech, and use Microsoft translation to translate the text. Socket.io and quickblox are also used to form Internet connections among phones.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>It is hard to translate when only a partial sentence is presented <br/>\nWe used self correction to overcome this. Basically the translator will translate for each word chunk of the speech and every word chunk has its second half identical to the first half of the next word chunk. So that we can get a chance to exam the translation of the word chunk to see that if its translation makes sense. If the translation text of the second half of the first word chunk is different from the translation text of the first half of the second word chunk, we redo the translation for the combination of these two word chunks and let the app re-present this part of text quickly to correct the translation error.</p></li>\n<li><p>Swift 3 just came out in a week and is relatively new, so it is sometimes hard to find the solution for a swift issue</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Conquer problems caused by new Swift 3 API</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Development with Swift 3.0<br/>\nMultithreading management for Swift 3<br/>\nNLP</p>\n<h2>What's next for EasternT</h2>\n<p>Enhance the accuracy of real time translation using NLP techniques<br/>\nEnable group chatting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">speech</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mricrosoft-translator</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/quickblox\">quickblox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">alamofire</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["ADAS ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UDmi_GVcU7U?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ADAS  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/211/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The recent innovations in autonomous car technology excited us to discover and make our own form of lane tracking technology to guide cars with minimal resources \u2013 simply a dashboard camera. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By utilizing the OpenCV library and a camera, our program is able to track car lanes and give the necessary feedback to a car for either driving straight or slightly turning on curves in the road. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our goal was to utilize minimal resources, sure we could have used 20 lasers and 4 cameras on each side of the car\u2026 but that\u2019s been done. We purposely limited ourselves to a single camera and one library to show that technology for the car doesn\u2019t need to be as complicated as it seems or nearly as expensive. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since the math concepts and issues were part of the fun, we needed to ask mentors for help in linear algebra or we got creative with our solutions underneath the hood. One problem was making the turning work (based off the red lines) we were told that it was a form of complicated linear algebra, so we thought why find the intersection between groups of lines when one can get an average of the positive and negative correlation groups and intersect the average. This solution ended up fixing our problem.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we\u2019re proud of</h2>\n<p>Well, we finished our goal! We were intimidated at first since autonomous cars are buzzing around in industry currently, and making a feature to help autonomous cars seemed difficult for a couple of first-year undergraduates. Honestly, we\u2019re also surprised that we avoided that linear algebra still\u2026 that was a nightmare. \nWhat we learned\nWe learned that with enough math, and a creative outlook, a lot of problems can be solved with a single sensor and smart coding. Of course having multiple sensors would help make our technology better; however, innovation occurs when one is limited in time and resource, that very philosophy allowed us to drive our project to completion.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s next for ADAS</h2>\n<p>We want to add car tracking to ADAS on our next revision to see incoming cars and check if they\u2019re going straight or turning. This would be a safety feature to avoid issues such as drunk drivers or texters veering into the wrong lane.

It can transport us into wonderful faraway lands, and even keep us grounded in reality. Unfortunately, with the hustle and bustle of modern city life, not many people can find the time to just sit down and enjoy a great book. Even school-aged children seem to be reading less than their predecessors, and the consequences of this situation are being seen with decreasing literacy rates around the world. </p>\n<p>In North America, there is still access to books via libraries, ebooks, and audiobooks. But people in other places around the world aren't as fortunate. Direly slow internet speeds (or even no internet) and a lack of resources results in ever decreasing literacy in developing nations. That needs to change.</p>\n<p>Regardless of age, location, or occupation, everybody can spend a couple of minutes every day reading small excerpts from books that they're interested in but never seem to get the time to enjoy. Additionally, most developing nations, while without reliable internet and/or libraries, have cellular network connections. This can change things.</p>\n<p>Nobody should have to live without beautiful literature, and reading more is the best starting stone to a more informed and educated society. It was through that line of thinking that <em>Alexandria</em> was born. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>Alexandria</em> allows users to text a phone number, select a book, and receive small snippets at a time. If one so desires, one can request for the next snippet ahead of time, or wait for one day (the time period over which the next snippets are sent out on a daily basis). </p>\n<p>With a diverse collection of literature, every person with a cellular phone - including those in developing nations - has access to amazing public domain resources at their fingertips. No internet and no contractual time commitment required.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><em>Alexandria</em> is built on top of Node.js with Express.js, connected to a Firebase database, and deployed on the Google Cloud Platform. The Twilio API ties together the core SMS functionality. This modern and diverse technology stack ensures for modularity and maintainability of the core code and application architecture.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we attempted to use a MySQL database with Python to handle storing books and user information. This proved to be a challenge due to certain limitations and deprecations that MySQL has compared with more modern database management systems.

The frontend is responsible for the conversation with the bot, and gathers the right data to send to the backend. </p>\n<p>We built the backend on top of a LAMP stack, using PHP 5, and the Yii2 framework. The backend takes the inputs as JSON, creates or updates a user profile, and then uses Google's NLP API to determine what the text input contains. After passing the text through the NLP API, the backend receives the type of food consumed (i.e. banana), and its quantity. This is then passed to FatSecret, a nutrition API which provides us with the amount of calories consumed. This data is then logged in the MySQL database, and the number of calories is then sent back to the frontend, which passes it off to the client on Messenger.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Communicating between the different parts of the application</li>\n<li>FatSecret API (lack of documentation)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A working demo</li>\n<li>Working smoothly on top of the Google Cloud Platform`</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot about Facebook Messenger API, Google's NLP API, and the FatSecret nutrition API</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for FatBot</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We want to be able to scale FatBot in order for it to handle more commands, display data to the user in a meaningful way, integrate with Google Fitness, and build support for shareable web profiles</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yii2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/debian\">debian</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">messenger-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-natural-language-processing-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-compute-engine\">google-compute-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://fatbot.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fatbot.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>fatbot.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on integrating the Google NLP API and using it to tokenize user input in order to determine the type and quantity of food eaten.

You start by renting out a bike from a nearby station, you do your thing, then return it. There are stations scattered throughout the city, and you can bike anywhere you want, as long as you return the bike to any of these stations. </p>\n<p>So, one interesting feature about Bike Share\u2019s payment model is that after having paid for a day pass, your first 30 minutes are free, and then you are charged by the minute. So, if you don\u2019t check-in to a station within that time, you will automatically get charged on your credit card. As hackers, we saw this as an opportunity. We always ask ourselves, how could we maximize our returns? In this case, how far can we get, for free?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Bike Bud is a mobile app that takes your current location and helps you localize the nearest Bike Share station. Not only that, but from there, you can choose your city, and then particular areas of interest from the home screen, such as the CN tower or Cherry Beach, and Bike Bud will map out your itinerary from station to station, keeping your costs low. </p>\n<p>As an app that aims to save our users money, we intend to keep Bike Bud free. However, that is not to say that we don\u2019t have a revenue plan. Based on a user\u2019s previous routes or while planning a new one, Bike Bud could host ads for restaurants, events or shops that are nearby. This not only helps out companies with exposure but also shows users what they might be missing while getting from point A to point B. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>With love</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Building the graph from the Google Maps API and finding the shortest path</li>\n<li>Setting up Cockroach DB on Google Cloud</li>\n<li>Looking for swag</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Algorithm design is hard :(</p>\n<h2>What's next for Bike Bud</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Optimized graph algorithm</li>\n<li>Ad integration</li>\n<li>More cities</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cockroachdb</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mobile</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gstellarhtn/bikebud\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gstellarhtn/bikebud\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["UI/Front-end", "Bixi and Ride Share API integration / Graph logic implementation", "", ""]], ["Pick Me Up", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>For days you would rather forget, we have created an app to give you encouragement and fill your life with positivity. </p>\n<p>Peer support is now at the press of a button in your pockets at all times.

We were mostly inspired by inevitable consequence of a lot of career fairs and meetups - most people do not get to talk to prospective employers and employers miss out on a lot of formidable student's who could turn out to be rockstar employees.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Syncin seamlessly connects people by using iBeacons - a class of Bluetooth low energy (BLE) devices that broadcast their identifier to nearby portable electronic devices. Imagine a student , let's call her Jamie, walking around Hack The North Sponsor Booths and trying to get the attention of sponsors. The Booths are all occupied and the place is fully packed. Enters Syncin. With Syncin, All she needs to do is go to close to the Booth she is interested in and pull up Syncin on her iphone. In a time as short as the time between the beginning and end of your last blink, she detects the BLE signal from the Beacon. She shares, from Syncin, her predefined details including linkedin profile, academic status and a 100 word summary with the person in the both and also saves the contact information of the company she just met which includes a short pitch from the company. Something in the line of \"We make cool stuff, have free lunch and offer free massages. Let's chat about opportunities at Cool Company\", if the company is targeting a particular demographic.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the company's rep or recruiter is able to go back, log into Syncin desktop app and directly view the  profile and other details of the people who 'met' her at the event. In addition to viewing this list, the rep can also directly message the candidates or ask for more information. If they like a physical copy of the list, they can directly print it from their Syncin dashboard or export it to excel where they are able to extract emails for bulk messaging. </p>\n<p>If they have multiple events, they can also add those events to their dashboard and set up their Beacon for these events. One Beacon, &lt;$40, can be reused for as many events as possible.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In building Syncin, we were social-minded and we were guided by our desire to build something that people will use. We thought it would be nice to help student's who are not assertive get connected to Employers while also helping Employers get the talent that they deserve. In addition to this, we built Syncin with an approachable personality to engage our users through empathy, emotional design and wholehearted dedication.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we coded in Swift for the ios app and for connecting multiple beacons to different iphones. Furthermore, for the web interface, we primarily used javascript with inclduing angular js to provide a three way data binding between our view, our <strong>firebase</strong> real-time database and the controller which drives all the change and operations in the view and the database. Firebase was also used for integrating the operations between our webapp and ios app. With firebase, we did not have to worry about platform difference. </p>\n<p>While building Syncin, we created two user groups, Admins and Users. An admin, event organizer, is able to create multiple events with one iBeacon and place the iBeacon inside their booth with the iBeacon number visible to event goers to leave their contact information. A regular user, on the other hand, is able to store multiple contacts and modify their profile to cater to each employer before scanning an iBeacon. Our goal was to make the experience as seamless and ubiquitous as possible.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This is a great question. We initially started out building a recipe app or deal suggestion app or nutrition app. We did not even know what were we building! We had all the api's ready and we already built most of the Interface for both the Web and ios app for the former idea. At about 5pm on Sunday, one of us challenged our conformity. We then realized that we had shared our old idea with did not think it was practical. Some of them did not understand what we were trying to accomplish. We could not even articulate what we were doing, passionately! Fortunately, however, after waking up from our slumber of building stuff we thought some companies we were targeting would like, here we are awake all night building something and writing about something we are truely proud of. Something we have built with our whole heart and because we think it will be useful to students like us. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We failed yet we were able to wake up. We wrote code for an unpractical idea yet we were able to make the code practical for loaded idea. We  started with something that many people questioned. We were reminded to keep asking questions and we are happy we made something we are are all truly proud of and will definitely love to continue to work on. We had fun even while dozzing off, coding and writing this, simultaneously.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that no matter the amount of time, effort, money, sweat and even blood we invest in a project, completing it after we realizing that it is a bad project won't change it from being shitty to being less shitty.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Synchin</h2>\n<p>Good question! We have a lot of work to do. The prospects that we envision for Syncin is a challenge for us and we plan to build it from ground up using better practices and more reliable tools and frameworks so that it can be used by our family and us. Since we think people are our family, we want people to try Syncin and we definitely want to put in more research and work into making it better.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibeacon\">ibeacon</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/core-foundation\">core-foundation</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/core-data\">core-data</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nikodraca/syncin-ios\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nikodraca/syncin-ios\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/uchibeke/buyn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/uchibeke/buyn\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://buyn-811ef.firebaseapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://buyn-811ef.firebaseapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>buyn-811ef.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the iOS app in Swift.

The accumulated data is pushed onto a real-time database provided by Firebase every second to simulate real-time transferring and updating.</p>\n<p>The Android application utilizes the Google speech-to-text API to recognize the user's commands to AVA. The text received is later passed to be analyzed: if there are occurrences of any known commands, AVA will execute that command. Every time a command is chosen, it is pushed onto the Firebase database. The main logic for all assistant tasks is processed in this application.</p>\n<p>The screen used to display the holographic-like projection of AVA was created in Unity. The 3D models as well as animations are distributed for free by mixamo as well as other sites such as turbosquid and Autodesk. As the viewer of our project, the program behind the screen projection verifies every second for any updated values or commands to understand which animation and scene to display.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>For the Raspberry Pi, we originally planned on having infrared position location by aligning multiple infrared sensors in a circle around the projection. Unfortunately, the infrared sensors were too efficient and could detect around them no matter the direction the infrared signals were coming from. Furthermore, we had planned on using a USB-port webcam with an integrated microphone to process the speech-to-text function. Sadly, it was impossible for us to detect the webcam on the Raspberry Pi, and we were left with no microphones to implement this feature. After some thinking, we decided that using an Android phone's built-in microphone as well as native text-to-speech features was a more simple and efficient solution. Another problem we encountered during the last night of the hackathon; we could not display the animations via the script, and we could not figure out why until a very long time of searching and understanding that this was due to an error that had not been raised by the compiler.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team of two software engineering students and one electrical engineering student, we are very amazed at how equal the percentage* of efforts we have put into this project. All three components melded extremely well together, and we can't imagine this project being as amazing as it is right now without any of the team members. We are especially proud of how interactive AVA feels when used by someone. We feel that this assistant prototype inspires us to look forward to a future where handier tools and companions will be available, and where holographic projections are omnipresent.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest aspects we have learned from this project is the usage of databases and HTTP requests. Of course, two of us had taken courses of networks beforehand, but we had never gotten the chance to have this much hands-on experience. We were the creators, editors and maintainers of our database, and we had to coordinate each other regarding how information would have to be passed and understood between the different components. For the Android application, the usage of Google speech-to-text as well as the translate API was simple yet rewarding; this is due to the fact that we would never have had to learn them in such a short amount of time, and this pushed us to be more adaptive and open to learning about new technologies.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ProjectAVA</h2>\n<p>We believe we are onto something revolutionary; a future where humans can be accompanied and helped by an omnipresent companion doesn't seem so far-fetched and idealistic anymore. The prototype we currently have is a first but solid of future increments. This design can be further solidified, improved in many ways, such as the presentation of the plastic pyramid. Furthermore, in a setting where time isn't so fleeting, it would be easier for us to breathe a little and stir up even more ideas to make the experience for users even more interactive and intuitive.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dbqt/ProjectAVA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dbqt/ProjectAVA\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mostly on the 3D visualization and integrating animations on Unity3D.

In addition, in some situations, calling 911 is unsafe or physically impossible. Furthermore, if the center is experiencing high volume, users may be placed on hold.</p>\n<p>For a place that handles life and death situations, 911 losing valuable time simply because dispatchers have trouble determining your location is unacceptable. Improving location accuracy and reducing the amount of time it takes to report an emergency would save many lives. With that in mind, we built an alternate way to contact emergency services and ensure that no emergency goes unreported.</p>\n<h2>What We Built</h2>\n<p><strong>App</strong></p>\n<p>We built an Android app that allows users to quickly press a button to report the type of emergency and location. Users have the option of selecting \"Track My Location,\" which uses the GPS and sends periodically sends your updated location information to the emergency operator, or \"Custom Location,\" which allows users to select a position on the map. Users can also send details about their situation and/or upload an image. This information is then forwarded to the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Web</strong></p>\n<p>The website displays basic information of the submitted emergencies in a table for emergency operators. Clicking on an emergency opens up a modal that contains all the information, including a map that displays the location. Operators can send a response back to the users, as well as update its status and assign it a level. The website automatically checks for updates and displays them accordingly so the operator does not need to manually refresh the page.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p><strong>App</strong></p>\n<p>We used Xamarin to create the Android app, which was programmed in C#. Google Maps API was used to geocode locations. In addition, we used Google Cloud Platform to generate additional information about the user's surroundings from a picture. By using the Google Vision API, labels of interest are sent to the web interface, allowing for more detailed information.</p>\n<p><strong>Web</strong></p>\n<p>Golang was used for the server-side. HTML5 and CSS3 were used for the website, as well as Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Ajax and JSON were used to transmit data, so the page is dynamic and does not have to be reloaded.

Term after term, the process of connecting with others in the Waterloo/Kitchener region seemed to be a nuisance for both the subleter and subletee. Creating a simple, easy, and useful solution to this common problem that so many students like ourselves face was the inspiration for EasySub!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>EasySub is an Android Application that links individuals looking for a property to sublet with others hoping to sublet their properties. It does so through an intuitive interface that allows any subletter to view available properties in the Kitchener/Waterloo region, read the property details, and contact the sublettees of the properties that interest them. On the other hand, as a sublettee, you can post descriptive details about your property, including pictures, price, and amenities to entice the many subletters browsing on EasySub.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>EasySub was programmed in Java using Android Studio. A Google Maps API was implemented to help users view the available properties around them on a map.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning how to use Android Studio proved to be a bigger battle than expected.  The process of downloading, setting up, and gaining familiarity with the IDE seemed to be half the battle of the entire hackathon. Nevertheless, we were able to complete the app with time to spare.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>With the unfamiliarity of Android Studio came many opportunities to strengthen our debugging skills. This helped to reinforce our programming ability and learn coding techniques that we will never forget.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use the Google Maps API and how valuable networking is at hackathons like Hack the North.</p>\n<h2>What's next for EasySub</h2>\n<p>The next steps for EasySub are to continue adding features that will simplify the process of connecting students who are looking to sublet. Some of these features include sublet agreements between the subletter and sublettee,monthly rent transfers, and the ability to rate properties after subletting them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hsennik/SubLit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hsennik/SubLit\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["keyin", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"keyin \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/067/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"keyin \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/068/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"keyin \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/069/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"keyin \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/070/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"keyin \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/071/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our team of 4 have known each other since high school through common classes. Due to our inherent nerdiness, we have always been fascinated with programming and working with/looking at data. During our time in our statistics class in high school, we were amazed at the quality and quantity of the data provided by government organizations such as Statistics Canada, but were a little disillusioned as to how poorly such data was presented. Thus, We saw this Hackathon as the perfect opportunity to build an easily accessible and usable data modelling application that will present said data in a much more appealing fashion.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Keyin makes the visualization of open data easy and fun to use. We have found that websites providing Canadian open data online are generally slow, hard to use and often lock features behind paid tiers. Keyin makes searching for data an extremely easy and rewarding experience, and also presents said data in a beautiful and engaging way.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Since some of us have had little to no experience with JavaScript libraries, we saw this as the perfect opportunity to dive in with our friends guiding each other. We pulled data from namara.io in the form of JSON Objects, and parsed it to display a list of results, then our data on that individual result. We drew the data using chart.js, as well as d3.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into multiple challenges pulling the data from namara.io, as they did not allow us to pull data from them at the mass scale that we hoped we could. In the end, we had to scale down and settle for just retrieving their data in Toronto (of which there were around 200 sets). Additionally, we initially planned to build the graphs solely with D3, but it proved extremely challenging to use and we had to switch to chart.js for the sake of time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to have built a beautiful website where one can easily search for and display data in a visually appealing and user friendly manner. We have also becomed much better versed in the various languages and libraries we used.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt Node, Express and chart.js rather well from this experience.

Some of our teachers went beyond this and rewarded their students with points that could be spent on rewards, such as pizza, movie days, and toys. This was the original idea for Points and Me; to create a elegant, approachable, and friendly system for rewarding students for excelling in academics.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Points and Me as a website allows teachers to create an account. The teacher can then register a class, and register students for said class. For each class, they can setup achievements and tasks for the students to accomplish, how much each achievement/task is worth in points, redeemable rewards, and how much said rewards are worth. Students can login and track the achievements and tasks they have accomplished, how many points they have to spend, and purchase the rewards using their points. Once a student has made a purchase, it is added to the teacher\u2019s fulfillment queue and removed at the teacher\u2019s request.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Points and Me was built using a Google Firebase backend and AngularJs as a frontend framework. Google Firebase was chosen for its ease of use, speedy setup time (essential for hackathons), scalability, and reliability. AngularJs was chosen for its scalable and easy to use content organization. Both Google Firebase and AngularJs were chosen because we all wanted to explore new frameworks for achieving our task. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As with any group trying to learn and use new frameworks, we faced a few major hurdles in the learning process. Working with AngularJs\u2019 views and model system, and general CSS woes were major roadblocks for us.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, we got things sorted out and when things finally started coming together, it was extremely rewarding to see all the bits and pieces work like a clock. There\u2019s always a point in every project where you step back and appreciate what you\u2019ve made and see it less as a problem, and more as a product that could change the world.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re excited to say as individuals and as a group, we all learned the following:\nGoogle Firebase, AngularJs, brainstorming, marketing, choosing and narrowing features for a minimal viable product, running on little to no sleep, and a little about each other.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Points And Me</h2>\n<p>Of course with most projects coming out of hackathons, the first step is polishing our project to a mirror shine. We would love to finalize and add many of the features that didn\u2019t get completed/added in during the hackathon. Looking farther into the future, we truly believe a system like Points and Me could help motivate and push many students to be better. We\u2019d love to start looking into talking with institutions in order to made the signup and login process much more elegant and integrated into student life. Automatic class creation and student inclusion, a phone companion app to remind students of their classes and homework, etc. We\u2019d also love to expand the concept to possibly change all levels of education; for instance, imagine if we could automatically grade math papers and, using machine learning, find out what areas of math a student is more or less proficient at? With said data, we could tailor course curriculums to be more personalized, and set up reward incentives for helping students become better than they would otherwise be in a regular academic system. The sky for changing the way we teach the future generation is limitless, and we\u2019re excited to keep exploring the frontier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RithuC/pointsandme\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/RithuC/pointsandme\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["UofT Scheduler", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UofT Scheduler \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/013/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UofT Scheduler \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/014/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to provide useful information to University of Toronto students about their schedule in a quick and accessible way. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Lists out your schedule on a certain day, displays your class distances, displays the locations on a map, and displays directions between classes.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Front end with just HTML and jQuery.

All of us were beginner with Unity, VR, and hologram so we wanted to pick up some new technologies building the project, too. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The system can detect and process human emotions in real time via a webcam utilizing openCV and machine learning. Then it sends json data to Unity which renders a 3d face that mimics the user's facial expression. Thanks to Unity, the 3d face is projected onto a pyramid hologram (a DIY and affordable hologram).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our own emotional recognition program/algorithm from scratch. After hours of tinkering with openCV and machine, we got a training program that yields improving results. We then asked fellow hackers around us to help trained our ML program by making happy/sad/angry faces in front of the webcam. The program was then trained to better detect emotion. To deliver updated emotion data to Unity, we set up a web server using C#. As it records input, the Python script sends requests to this service, which in turn updates the values used by Unity to set the expression of the hologram face. We built the hologram face and shape keys using Blender then imported it in Unity. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Unity sometime crashes and doesn't cooperate with what we expected.

People making food in kitchens always have the opportunity to make a little more, to do something with what get's leftover. Additionally, people everywhere are lacking time and resources, to make a nice, wholesome meal, and usually resort to eating sub-nutritious food. To solve this problem, we created NeighborCater!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>NeighborCater has a simple goal - To allow household kitchens to become booming small businesses. Thousands of people in local communities look for outside food, when they'd much rather settle for cheaper, home-cooked food. NeighborCater allows this transaction to happen by placing kitchens on the forefront - listing what they make, their location, etc. Buyers can view each Kitchen, contact the \"chef\" through email and phone number, and eventually buy the item. The \"chef\" gets a notification of his/her orders and can manage what they are selling throughout the day, what's leftover. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>NeighborCater is an iOS AND an Android App. We were successfully able to replicate the app on both platforms, using Swift and Java, respectively, which proved much more difficult that we originally thought. Our primary backend was Firebase, holding the restaurant data, buyer info, orders, user authentication, and more. We utilized various CocoaPods and Online APIs including Google AutoComplete, XE.API and the Google Maps API for location address and currency conversion of prices. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating Firebase with our front-end was somewhat difficult, as we had to ensure both iOS and Android would be able to efficiently interface with it. We developed our custom data schema, to ensure both parties would be able to seamlessly integrate. Another challenge that we ran into was our Github workflow, which set us back a few hours. Developing on different machines, and using different dependencies, build files such as the 'gradle.build' were bound to be altered, and required persistent effort to correct.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>One accomplishment that we are extremely proud of is using Firebase as our multi-platform backend. The integration of our backend in both iOS and Android, is seamless. This ensures that anyone is able to use our service, and expands the reach of our app's effect on the community.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use XE.com's API to efficiently and effectively convert prices into, and from, different currencies. We explored developing a multi-platform application, and the work involved in ensuring a seamless developmental workflow is existent. Throughout development, a Github workflow was put into place, however there were numerous issues we ran into, including merge conflicts. We learned how to resolve conflicts, and correctly issue pull requests to ensure features and snippets of code, are integrated in our base layer.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NeighborCater</h2>\n<p>We will expand our project into the field of Web. This expands our range of effect on the community, and makes it available for more users. Also, a set of new features including, reviews, food images, and in-app communication.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TheCurryMan/NeighborCater\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TheCurryMan/NeighborCater\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the Ui and setting up FireBase ", "Primary Graphic Designer.

We made this using AJAX. </p>\n<p>For connecting the various APIs to our web applications, we used JSON parsing among other things.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a lot of issues with the Youtube API since there was no documentation on how to use/maniupulate Youtube captions. Also, for connecting the APIs to our web app, we ran into issues such as caching data results.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of executing our whole vision together. Our team was composed of two first time hackathon attendees. All our team members worked together efficiently to tackle errors and roadblocks along the way. </p>\n<p>Most importantly, our team had a lot of fun learning and hacking together!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that a fresh pair of eyes always brings powerful insights to arduous tasks!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Watch &amp; Learn</h2>\n<p>We plan to implement a more engaging platform with personalized data analytics, more accurate subtitles, and grammatical help (with natural language processing). </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">youtub-iframe-data-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dictionary-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethanchewy/WatchAndLearn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ethanchewy/WatchAndLearn\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on extracting YouTube captions from videos using the YouTube API, and performing translations and image searches for words using the Yandex and Flickr APIs.", "I worked on accessing the Youtube subtitles through asynchronous calls and creating an auto scrolling/searching functionality for the subtitles.", "Worked a bit on the UI, and the algorithm for corresponding transcripts to the video.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our inspiration for codeAide was the numerous coders who have very specific coding problems that never get solved. codeAide offers programmers a way to get help with code, or to make money by helping other coders.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>codeAide is an online marketplace that connects programmers and developers with potential clients. Anyone can submit a request or need for a certain snippet of code - or a whole program - that one does not want to or cannot program. In response, anyone can submit an answer to this request. In our two-tier compensation system, all submissions that fulfill the test cases set up by the requester will receive a portion of the participation award (the first tier), and one submission will be declared the winner and receive extra credits (the second tier). This ensures participation and treats the submitters and the requesters equitably. All the code not chosen as the winner by the requester, remains the intellectual property of the submitter. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built codeAide using Laravel and PHP while creating the database with SQLite. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Given that PHP, Laravel, and SQLite are new for us, we've had a good amount of difficulty with each, running into many PHP and Laravel errors that are specific and make us wish that codeAide was already a thing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We learned a new language - PHP - and framework - Laravel - for this project, and we are proud of what we made here with what we've learned.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Laravel, and create and implement databases. Our knowledge of PHP has increased greatly, as we used it extensively to build this website.</p>\n<h2>What's next for codeAide</h2>\n<p>codeAide will exchange credits for real currency. We will also strive to create a much more secure website, both technically and legally. Sleep is next for the creators of codeAide, but improving codeAide to be more robust and usable by improving on the previously mentioned topics is what is next for codeAide itself.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">layoutit!</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/drew-neely/codeAide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/drew-neely/codeAide\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Full stack developer", "", "", ""]], ["uClip", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wT_3q9bCmnw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"uClip \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/403/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Copy more than just words, screenshots work as well</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"uClip \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/416/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Simply paste!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"uClip \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/389/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Integrate with different companies.

We wanted to make collaboration more efficient. We wanted seamless integration between web apps and mobile apps. So we built a universal clipboard - uClip. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Have you ever had to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>E-mail yourself a picture?</li>\n<li>Facebook message a degraded version of a picture?</li>\n<li>Share a short snippet of code or link with a colleague?</li>\n<li>Upload a screenshot onto Google Drive?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From Android to PC or vice versa, uClip allows you to copy and paste content instantly. In addition, if you wanted to take a screenshot on your phone, just press CTRL-V on your PC and the image will appear instantly. The service works between PC's as well for team integration.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using Android Studio and Java, our team of 4 split into two groups. One group in charge of the PC aspect of this service and another group in charge of the Android portion. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>3 out of the 4 team members are first time hackathon participants. The team had to self-teach themselves and implement what they learned right after. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The team was able to fully utilize Firebase\u2019s API as well as Yelp API\u2019s. The functionalities that we discovered with Java and Android Studio spiked our interests and understanding to further progress in the world of programming.</p>\n<h2>What's next for uClip</h2>\n<p>Increase security, features, and functionalities.

We also have microservices for intelligently finding nearby events and attractions, determining currency conversions based on gps location and for businesses to serve promotions to travlrs.</p>\n<h3>APIs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google cloud</strong> - Used as the back-end for our website and for hosting all of our microservices.</li>\n<li><strong>Xe</strong> - Used for our geolocation based currency conversion. (not in final version)</li>\n<li><strong>Google maps</strong> - Used to display the locations of nearby events and attractions.</li>\n<li><strong>Google places</strong> - Used for data gathering to intelligently serve events and attractions nearby.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Languages / Frameworks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Node.js</strong> - Used for everything serverside -- microservices and the site back-end.</li>\n<li><strong>JS</strong> - Used for everything front-end -- talking to the site back-end and client-side logic.</li>\n<li><strong>SASS</strong> - For making our UI beautiful.</li>\n<li><strong>Jade</strong> - The templating engine used with our express back-end.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The sponsors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google</strong> - We made extensive use of Google cloud and other Google APIs including maps and places.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The roadmap</h2>\n<p>We expect to continue developing travlr after HTN. Having worked towards a minimum viable product for the last 36 hours, we have come to terms with the full breadth and scale possible with travlr. Many features didn't make it into the MVP so allow me to elaborate --</p>\n<h3>Dreamer</h3>\n<p>During development, we decided to use the Disney creative strategy. Our 'dreamer' goals were as follows --</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow businesses to offer discounts to local groups of travlrs.</li>\n<li>Create a social network for travlrs, the use of 'travlr-codes' was thrown around during ideation.</li>\n<li>Use travlr codes for discounts at partner locations.</li>\n<li>Integrate travlr points, redeemable against travel related events etc.</li>\n<li>Use machine learning to learn the preferences and interests of a user, with the goal of intelligently generating events.</li>\n<li>Travlr meetups, if there is a cluster of travlrs, suggest meetups -- this ties into group discounts also.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Realist</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate recommended events and locations 'intelligently', based on a user's interests and preferences.</li>\n<li>Have a frontend maps visualization of these locations.</li>\n<li>Segment development into a series of microservices.</li>\n<li>Implement basic business offers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Critic</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate events using keyword matching and multipliers such as willingness to travel.</li>\n<li>Maps visualization. </li>\n<li>A few microservices to handle the various APIs used.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Business model</h3>\n<p>The core business model of travlr is similar to, and much inspired by, Pokemon GO. Imagine the 'lure' system, businesses can offer up incentives such as group discounts -- maybe a free drink if a group of 10 or more travlrs visit, for example. This can be stretched in similar ways, consider the UBER surge pricing model -- but in reverse.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Two of our three team members traveled from the UK, during our trip; and many before this, we have struggled to decide exactly what we want to do with our time when travelling. This is especially true for day trips to cities for example. This sparked our initial idea to apply machine learning to make an interest -&gt; event matching system.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Travlr, in its current dev state, suggests events based on a users interests, their location, their willingness to travel etc. It tracks the travlr to suggest events nearby, and features a cross platform UI meaning it can be used on any device. We have architected travlr to be scaleable, for the addition of the previously mentioned features at a later date. This is why we took the microservice approach.</p>\n<h2>What it doesn't</h2>\n<p>The scope for travlr was large -- even for a month long project, let alone a 36hr hackathon. We went into the project well aware of this, but continued as the breadth of knowledge we gained in infrastructure, new languages and frameworks was incredibly valuable. Our release version did not quite hit our MVP plan but features fully capable microservices using Google cloud services.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microservices</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Setup Mongo DB back end and node server configuration.

We were able to secure it from him.</p>\n<p>Next up was the Myo. Initially we were hoping to use this armband as a controller to emulate the holding of a ping pong paddle. Although we could not secure it, our creativity and tenacity allowed us to learn arduino and use the 101 version as a makeshift paddle, as it contains a gyroscope and accelerometer.</p>\n<p>We faced many more problems. None of us was exceptionally experience in Unity3D, nor were we well versed in or about C#, Arduino or Oculus. </p>\n<p>We iterated, conquering one problem after another and gaining momentum until we raced ahead at the pinnacle of speed; ferociously squashing the bugs that fell before us.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of each other. We each contributed all that we had and worked in sweat and toiled without sleep for the better part of the weekend. Each of us learned components, abstracting the details of their facet and creating beautiful interfaces for all of us to work with. Then came the app. The first 24 hours were spent in agony; for the majority of it, we did not even have the equipment neccessitated. We persevered and accomplished all and everything we set out to do.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned Oculus, C#, Unity3D and many other technologies. But above all, we learnt that great minds with great goals can accomplish even greater things.</p>\n<h2>What's next for G.G.E.</h2>\n<p>We allowed many people to play the game. Sponsors, Judges, Co-Hackers and all agreed that it was a fantastic app. Many could not put it down and loved it so much they said we should publish it. Perhaps this is the future for this retro app using tech on the bleeding edge.</p>\n<p>Thank you too all the fantastic sponsors, judges, students, hackers, chefs, volunteers, mentors and all those who contributed to making HackTheNorth a fantastic experience.

The user can then select a language to learn and begin engaging with real world content. While reading the articles they can call up real-time translations and store challenging phrases to work on later. Should they choose to return to their saved phrases they would be able to quiz themselves on the correct translations. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We attempted to use a trainable neural network fed by a web-crawler to collect content. We then parsed this content in to a database and built a user front-end to present the articles to our users. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Having succeeded at projects within our comfort area at past hackathons, our teams goal at this hackathon was to maximize the challenge we presented to ourself in the hope of learning new skills. Unsatisfied with the multiligualism of news aggregators that we were familiar with, we set to make a spider to discover articles on a list of international news websites. News websites are similar-looking \u2014 frustratingly so because their structure to a crawler can differ significantly, requiring some extra sophistication to correctly classify article pages from non-articles, and grabbing the article text to be hosted on the Multilingo servers. Interestingly, we learned that this problem is largely solved by DiffBot and like services with cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The crawler then became more of a curiosity for the group as we tried to see how long it could continue to traverse the internet. While we were able to complete a functional project at this hackathon, unlike at past events, we were able to focus on trying new things, which at the end of the day maximized our enjoyment and learning at this event. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were happy to get some basic implementations of Tensor Flow functioning, create a well designed home page with some new special effects, and enjoy the hackathon experience. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We certainly learned a lot about new server methodologies with respect to collaborating and deploying with git, and connecting a variety of web frameworks like express.js and apache on one server. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Multilingo (Multilingo.me)</h2>\n<p>We would like to spend some more time on the upfront challenge of collecting and storing the news articles on an ongoing basis which will allow us to provide up to date content to our users. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nicks-fun-webcrawler</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">internet</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">german</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://multilingo.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://multilingo.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>multilingo.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Gamy McGameFace", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As we are from a big University that accomodates 35000+ students from UK, we have fairly big TechSoc that we are trying our best to make the best society in the University. So we run events accross the year ranging from TechTalks, workshops, Hackathons and Office Tours all for free!! Events are awesome, but when you have a continuous stream of events even if they are high quality events, since they are free there isn't enough incentive for people to come to events. This applies for hackathons and meetups as well. </p>\n<p>Another important thing to note is that we don't normally get enough metrics about attendees and frequency of their attendace to this meetings/events. This is what we are trying to solve here by making Gamy McGameFace. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A user registers to go for an event. User has our app installed in their phone. One organiser of the event will register the event in facebook with the UUID stamp of the iBeacon they are using. As soon as the user opens up the app in the event the iBeacon will send the UUID and the confirms it with my server which interacts with the microservice that pulls data from facebook page events to confirm the user has attended the event. So we reward the user with points. Each subsequent attendance get more and more points and badges (probably extra swagsssss)!!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>There are three Major part to this, </p>\n<h3>Python AWS lambda Microservice</h3>\n<p>This is an API we created to pull the data about events and location details. </p>\n<h3>Django API based Server</h3>\n<p>The mobile app interacts with this server to to register the user in to the event and find out current events when the user picks up his phone. The server also acts as the pipeline to the AWS lambda microserver.</p>\n<h3>Mobile App</h3>\n<p>This app we created in React Native uses those APIs we built to find the iBeacon transmits and let the server know that the user has attended the event.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting react native work on the Windows was a huge pain.

While with every passing day, technology continues to evolve at staggering rates, literacy skills have not changed. Reading and note taking, two of the most quintessential skills in education have remained stale for several decades. With this problem in mind, we designed and developed Noter, the note taking program ready to revolutionize education.</p>\n<h2>What does it do?</h2>\n<p>Noter utilizes natural language algorithms and statistics to help users understand complex texts better and faster. Noter currently allows users to paste text to be analyzed, however, Noter will soon offer OCR functionality by incorporating Google's Cloud Platform for Vision as well. OCR functionality will allow users to take pictures and even scan textbook pages which can then be analyzed. Noter currently acts as a stand alone Python desktop application, but will soon be available for mobile operating systems (Android and IOS) as well as web based platforms. Noter begins by emphasizing main ideas in the text to the user by either bolding or highlighting keywords based on importance and relevance to the overall text. Aside from emphasizing key ideas and words, Noter also provides the user with a glossary with easy access to quick definitions through a single click. In the future, Noter will also be capable of saving the notes which it created for future reference by the user.</p>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<p>All of the software for Noter is written in Python which incorporates various packages and libraries. Noter begins by analyzing the text which the user inputs using Google's Natural Language API. After some further analyses, keywords are chosen to be emphasized and to be put in the glossary. Between analysis, data is always stored in JSON format. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we were planning on developing an Android application which would incorporate OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to accomplish the same goals as Noter. However, we came to realize that our Android development experience as a team was not enough  to successfully accomplish our goals. However, we managed to pivot our focus and create a desktop application instead. Another problem which we ran into was that </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Utilizing JSON to store and transfer data.

Our other members have also heard of this infamous form and how tedious and time consuming it is, and decided to create a solution to automate, and thus expedite, the process.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user uploads their Google Scholar profile to our website, unCommon CV, and then the script we wrote recovers a table containing all important information of the papers the user authored. This includes the title, DOI, authors, date, summary, and many more important features. No extraneous work is required to search for the citations belonging to all the papers an individual has wrote--with a simple click, process is several orders of magnitude faster. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Initially we identified a solution that included Machine Learning algorithms and complete automation. However, once we understood our constraints and requirements better, the team shifted away from design complexity, removing time-consuming features that were not necessary for the MVP. </p>\n<p>The three main application modules are 1) Data mining and processing module 2) Back-end layer, and 3) Interfacing module. We kept the back-end layer as thin as possible in order to save cost and development time. The work was equally split between all three team members working on different aspects of the system.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As we had expected, interfacing our application with the Common CV's was the most challenging part. Common CV lacks API or any other programmatic interfaces.  Despite automation being the team's top priority, we decided to sacrifice some of the automation in order to complete the project on time.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>From what we had learned over the course of the past 36 hours, the most extraordinary feat for us was being able to make the front-end compliment the back-end work. Individually, we had all grown massively in our own computer science comprehension, and for a first Hack The North experience, it without a doubt served as a memorable. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>For Kelly, she had learned how to further her own learnings in python by using the Web.py and Beautiful Soup libraries, not to mention picking up PHP when working on the development of the back-end script. For Tim, he had a masterful comprehension of Python, and discovered new errors to troubleshoot when working with establishing the server for our script, and worked to interface the code with the front-end website. Sahad had picked up HTMK and CSS to lay the framework for the website, and then took the next step to increase the site's aestheticism with Bootstrap. Him and Tim were able to create a beautiful website. Tim also took a leadership role in the code development, providing guiding questions and tips to both Kelly and Sahad in finding a long-overdue solution to this problem. </p>\n<h2>What's next for unCommon CV</h2>\n<p>The next step would be to allow an option to upload a resume to unCommon, in which the website would fill CCV areas associated with information on the resume. We had tried to get a script going to parse over an uploaded resume and recognize/pull out data such as names, addresses, education, and experience. We had initially used the docx library from Python, but this proved to be a fairly large challenge in terms of examining all the possibilities of what could constitute important information. This would be the next step in terms of improving our product.

Yet, not many people seem to actually own these devices. What if there was a way for us to bring the LEAP Motion experience to everyone with a mobile phone?</p>\n<p><strong>Introducing LEAP</strong></p>\n<p>LEAP (or Leap Motion Emulating Android Project) is an Android app that allows you to use your front facing camera as a sensor for gestures, which can be interpreted by a computer and customized however you'd like.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>LEAP uses the front facing camera in order to recognize users' hands. The app tracks the position of the hand, and uses this to track gestures such as waving your hand to the right. The app also allows users to clench and unclench their fists as a form of gesture.\nFrom these data points, a Python script runs custom keyboard commands, allowing you to actually control your computer without even touching anything!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The image processing is done with the aid of OpenCV. We create a color filter based on the user's skin tone and after applying this to the frame, we get a contour of a hand. From here, we can take the convex hull in order to determine whether or not the hand is currently clenched. We calculate the center of the contour, which we can use to track movement.\nAll of the data that we collect about the contour, and its movement are then sent to a Firebase database, which is read from in real-time by a Python script. The Python script then determines if any of the data constitutes a gesture, and then executes the keyboard command corresponding to that gesture.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Where can we start?! Firstly, although OpenCV is widely used, the Java library is not as well documented. This is even worse for Android, so many of our problems and questions had to be solved with trial and error.\nEven once OpenCV <em>was</em> working, we still had to worry about false-positives. Moving your hand off of the screen often resulted in false hand-clenching reports. We also had to deal with the case of moving your hand back after completing an operation, which would often trigger the opposite keyboard action.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Basically, the whole app! \nWe have never used OpenCV before, and we're all pretty proud with how this turned out. We also ended up getting an MVP about 3/5 of the way through, which allowed us to fine-tune things.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>WE STILL HATE THE ANDROID CAMERA!!!</em></strong></li>\n<li>OpenCV for Android is under-documented and you have to get lucky with StackOverflow solutions</li>\n<li>Everyone loves Python</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for LEAP</h2>\n<p>We're looking to sell our app to Leap Motion for $1 000 000 000.

The app is hosted on Google cloud platform's Compute Engine and leverages a self-hosted CockroachDB instance for storing genomics data. We ran a dataset from UMD's BRCA1 database to train the variant prediction algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Visualizing Genes is hard because they are extremely lengthy concepts, with each base pair being very important. Building an interface for scientists meant that everyone was a power user, and therefore we had a very small room for latency. We reviewed every React component to try and squeeze performance using the shouldComponentUpdate optimization.</p>\n<p>Fetching data from multiple domains was another tricky problem we solved. Most sites have a strict cross domain policy, so our initial idea of loading the site and parsing it through jQuery was impossible. Instead, we wrote a server hosted on a VM on the Google cloud platform to fetch it via an http client included in the Go stdlib. Since we wrote the server in Go, fetching multiple data sources in parallel was trivial, thus reducing the amount of latency the user has to experience to get important genetic information.</p>\n<p>Ranking heuristics in human studies is hard.

They can mostly be split up into a few 'classes', outlined in this paper: <a href=\"http://www2.hawaii.edu/%7Ebinsted/papers/Binstedthesis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www2.hawaii.edu/~binsted/papers/Binstedthesis.pdf</a> . Many of the best one-liners are generated by first coming up with a punchline (usually a common idiom or phrase) and then providing an unexpected alternative context for the punchline. For example:</p>\n<p><em>My dad recently signed me up to the organ donation register... he's a man after my own heart.</em></p>\n<p>This formula is used in many of the best one-liners, so I wanted to see whether I could get a computer to generate them. I realised that the scope of this project was too much for a hackathon, so I narrowed it down to instead creating an app that generates \"witty\" company slogans based on the type of company. For example, for a pottery shop, it might generate the slogan <em>Seize the clay</em>. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I initially planned to use Google's NLP Cloud Platform to analyse common idioms and then work backwards to generate some context for them. This proved unfeasible. I then resorted to writing a scraper in Javascript to get a list of common idioms online, and then use a rhyming dictionary API combined with a text analysis API to generate witty slogans.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I ended up spending basically a whole day trying to get Google's Cloud Platform set up. I'm really bad at setting things up server-side so this ended up being a massive timesink and I unfortunately didn't manage it in the end.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I think my methodology was pretty solid, I just didn't manage to execute it properly :(</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Never underestimate the amount of time it can take to get a dev environment up and running.</p>\n<h2>What's next for punerator</h2>\n<p>I'd like to continue developing it in my spare time, making small improvements as I think of them, and hopefully start submitting some of Punerator's jokes to competitions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/refrigerator/punerator\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/refrigerator/punerator\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["GoudaBot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/64khaAbJOFY?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GoudaBot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/690/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GoudaBot \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/691/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GoudaBot \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/692/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GoudaBot \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/693/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>GoudaBot was inspired by the recent rapid increase in Chatbots and the emerging value that is becoming evident with regards to them.

For one, resources are scarce. Everybody has experience that scarcity at least once, and startup entrepreneurs are no different. When it comes to find somewhere to git shit done, it is very hard to assess potential spots for work. This is where MeetMeThere comes in.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MeetMeThere is your go-to when it comes to finding a spot for a meetup, whether for work, for business, or for fun. Build your teams, organize events, send events to your peers, choose a spot, and get down to business. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>MeetMeThere is built on the reliability, scalability and power of the .NET Framework and of C# and brought to you using AngularJS 1.x.\nOur team separated the project in the classical frontend vs backend subteams, where Felix was assigned to the backend, Alexandra to the markup and styling, Philippe to the binding with AngularJS and Alex to the integration of external APIs for the frontend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As we relied on an external server to test our API endpoints, we soon faced a major hurdle in Cross Origin Requests; indeed our frontend wouldn\u2019t allow to do the necessary AJAX to the servers due to the Same Origin Policy.\nWe used all of our wits to face the problem; setting headers on the server side, using CORS protocols, proxying the request through NodeJS in order to ease the transfer of the request.\nUltimately we ended up stuck when the NodeJS couldn\u2019t interact with the C# backend, and we decided after multiple hours to shift to an entire .NET stack. In doing so we relinquished our ability to develop freely since only one member was able to build the project. As such, any change would have to be uploaded to his computer and built from there before being tested.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>MeetMeThere may not be a final, polished product, but we are proud to say that four strangers came down together and got something done. We never faltered and we pursued our feverish work until the end, and that in itself is something we feel we should be proud of.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The value of proper task management and division;\nWhat aiming for a MVP stands for in terms of features and concessions\nThe underlying deceiving complexity of seemingly simple CRUD apps</p>\n<h2>What's next for Meet Me There</h2>\n<p>MeetMeThere is not just a product; it is the embodiment of a vision. With MeetMeThere, we aim to make the sea of information that is the Internet mesh with the real world. What are we aiming at? The largest IoT coverage of all public spaces to provide real time data about usage, conditions, and availability of these spaces.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/asp-net\">asp.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yelp\">yelp</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://meetmethere-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://meetmethere-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>meetmethere-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/FelixLeChat/meetmethere-backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FelixLeChat/meetmethere-backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["StreetRep.net", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StreetRep.net \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/223/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>StreetRep at the user's current location</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>StreetRep was inspired by the social bulletin application Yik-Yak where users can express their ideas on a location based forum and others can express their appreciation or start up conversations with others. StreetRep takes the socializing aspect of Yik-Yak to a whole new immersive level as users will feel closer to others by viewing the abundance of user activity around them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>StreetRep allows users to express their opinions in the form of text at their current position on the map. Other users can view posts around their area by looking at their respective maps. This way users are aware of how many other are in there area and are up to date with new events and activities. Each post by a user will be able to be voted positively or negatively, which will contribute to the user's reputation. Users with more reputation will gain benefits such as longer post lifespan, and less delays between posts. Users with lower reputation will have opposite effects until they can increase their reputation. This is a preventative measure against bots and malicious users.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The front-end consists of basic HTML/CSS from bootstrap and the google maps API, while the back-end mostly uses NODE.js with FireBase hosting our database. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Time was definitely a big challenge, alongside the fact that we did not decide with an idea until halfway through the event.

This data would be use to target select demographics, provide much needed services, and optimize resource allocation. </p>\n<p>The BIG idea: This project is a proof of concept for increasing hands-on tech opportunities for students and increasing the impact that a nonprofit's can make. Summer interns with the support of Canadian Government\u2019s Summer Student grant will work with Nonprofits on Open Data. With even no prior SQL experience such as myself, students can successfully parse the raw data into a Query-able database. From here the nonprofit can use the data to model predictions and to create targeting strategies. While the student intern receives valuable job experience that is not making coffee. Currently some nonprofits are paying for data but that money can be much better used once fed back into the community. Not only are we enabling students we are exponentially increasing the impact that a nonprofit can make. </p>\n<p>Solve: Non-profits needs data and the government of Canada provides data from Statistics Canada and other federal departments that is open for the public to use. The only issue is that these data are extremely overwhelming, unorganized, and raw. Having interns or an open-source community where we can make these data usable for the general public will only benefit our community. Read this great article here (<a href=\"http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/why-open-data/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/why-open-data/</a>) on how open data can make a difference.  </p>\n<p>Learn: This is the first time I have worked with SQL databases. I was able to to create an encompassing project where I installed/created a database (ubuntu), inserted data, and created an interface to access the database. The hardest part of the project is working with the volume of data.The raw data is not always consistent as some names or figures includes characters such as commas and the use of quotations.  I needed to use tricks such as replace all and wildcard matching to be able to manipulate and then insert into the database. </p>\n<p>This project uses this data set <a href=\"http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/93d89f25-2770-4030-814f-771fea2af2a4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/93d89f25-2770-4030-814f-771fea2af2a4</a> \"Neighbourhood income and demographics, taxfilers and dependents, by sex, marital status and age group\" which includes 203,902 data points. This data was parsed into a sqlite database separating each category to be easily queried. Then a fast C++ interface was implemented to allow anyone such as the marketing manager to find relevant information. </p>\n<p>Goal: of this project was to have a system where nonprofits can target select regions based on a variety of indicators. Such as income median, age median, age/sex breakdown. Due to a lack of time only a subset of these features were implemented. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/o00o00o/hackthenorth2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/o00o00o/hackthenorth2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Sportigo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sportigo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/385/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Main news feed v1.00</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sportigo \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/410/726/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Promotional Banner</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sportigo \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/411/235/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I've always tried to organize basketball between my friends when they drop by Toronto. Between the TTC being unreliable, the natural tardiness of some, and unforeseen events, I'd often end up with half-full teams and a lot of frustration. I've thought about asking people to join us for pick-up basketball, but I can't walk away from the court, or some other kids will take it for themselves.</p>\n<p>As a team, we were inspired by the huge success of Pokemon Go. We thought outside the box, and incorporated the idea of geographical game-play with open sports games. We 'gamified' pick-up games, so while you're walking down the street, you're able to check out nearby sports games (soccer, basketball, tennis, etc.) and drop by when you're free. This way, we're finally able to solve the problem of getting more people to play sports with, while encouraging everyone to get out and about and make new friends.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sportigo encourages exploration and exercise through a Google Maps view of your current location. Markers around you (within a certain distance that you may specify) which indicate local sports events near you. You can click on any event to view more information, register for it, and even get specific directions to the event. We've even built a chat-room so you can get to know each other, and hopefully you'll never show up to a volleyball game without a game ball again, either!</p>\n<p>You're able to specify what sports you love, so you can be alerted via Push Notification when an event pops up near your proximity. If you're someone who doesn't mind traveling, you can also specify a range for Sportigo so you can find events up to 100km away from yourself. If you're planning a sporting event, you no longer have to be restricted by how many people you know - you can invite the whole wide world via Sportigo.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Sportigo on the Android platform by using Android Studio. Primarily, the back-end of the application is run on Google Firebase. We use Firebase for as a Real-Time Database, so that any events created will simultaneously be synced on every phone. With Firebase Cloud Messaging, we also give Push Notifications to event creators when new users sign up for their events. We also rely on Firebase to run our chat system, allowing effective and constant communications between all parties involved. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial issues committing to GitHub</li>\n<li>Android Studio List View not populating elements</li>\n<li>Trying to emulate Android phone to allow Dangerous permissions, but discovering that it cannot be emulated and will always be denied (read: crashing continuously for hours despite troubleshooting)</li>\n<li>Backwards and forwards compatibility between ADK v.21 and v.23 (especially with permissions and Dangerous/Normal permissions)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully got Firebase to work although we've never used it before (shoutout to documentation)\nWe FINALLY got the Google Maps API to work by using a real phone, after LONG HOURS\nOur Teamwork &lt;3</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Material Design, Firebase, and Google Maps API and something called Haversine (distance calculation vector between two long/lat points). Who knew math would be useful!

This can easily be expanded to many other service industry applications and beyond, such as in hospitals wards, hotel room service, car rental, etc. to save time and streamline a wide variety of services for various clients. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used the Amazon Alexa Skill Kit (ASK) frameworks and the Amazon Echo device (a simulator). I have an Amazon Lambda function to process requests. Notifications are sent by Amazon SNS through emails or text messages.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I'm new to Amazon Alexa and used it for the first time. I'm also new to Amazon Lambda.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Being new to many of the skills I used for this project, I had to learn a lot of it over this weekend.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-cloudwatch\">amazon-cloudwatch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-sns\">amazon-sns</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-lambda</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["DucTech", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>TBD </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for DucTech</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
