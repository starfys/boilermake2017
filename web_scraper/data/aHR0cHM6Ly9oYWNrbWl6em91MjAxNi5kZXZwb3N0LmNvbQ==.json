[["NoteVote", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We've always had trouble deciding music at parties, so we decided to create an application that allows everyone to have a say in what music is played.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>NoteVote connects with Spotify's API and creates a playlist for the party.  Once the party is created, people can visit the room and begin adding songs and up voting or down voting songs.  From there the playlist continues on its own and adapts as people vote for the music they want to hear.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed the application in 3 parts.  Michael Smith and Will Mock worked on the backend and fronted of the website respectively.  Michael also developed the API that was used for both mobile applications.  The website was developed using the Laravel PHP framework.  Reiker Seiffe developed the iOS mobile application from the ground up using native iOS and Apple frameworks.  Jeffrey Ruffolo developed the Android application from the group up using mostly standard libraries provided as a part of Android Studio. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Spotify's API is limited in some respects which prevented us from doing certain things such as checking which song is currently playing or starting/stopping the music from our application.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're extremely proud that we were able to create a website, iOS application and Android application in under 21 hours. We're also proud how much we were able to learn in a 21 hours hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Jeffrey Ruffolo learned how to create Android applications.  Michael and Will furthered their knowledge in PHP and Laravel, and Reiker furthered his iOS and Apple knowledge.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NoteVote</h2>\n<p>At some point, we would to consider commercial opportunities  and try to launch this on a larger scale.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">blade</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Reikerseiffe/Hack-Mizzou-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Reikerseiffe/Hack-Mizzou-2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ec2-52-42-199-153.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ec2-52-42-199-153.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ec2-52-42-199-153.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front End web development and design.", "", "", ""]], ["The Online Harassment Awareness Center", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I was helping another friend on a project and I didnt quite understand what he was doing so to pass the time I started looking at the free stuff I recieved this morning.

The iPhone application also incorporates a library to read barcodes and then takes the resultant ISBN to query an API and gather a bunch of information about the book that the average college student would probably think too much a hassle to enter manually. There is also an application built in HTML,Javascript that mirrors most of the functionality of the mobile application.</p>\n<p>## Challenges we ran into\nMany of the libraries I was using were written in Objective-c which made integrating them into a Swift 3 project insanely headache inducing. We also had a few issues tracking down bugs in the PHP API. The web developers on our team found the barcode reading components to be much more finicky when implemented on the desktop. We also had very lazy, entitled interns. Typical millenials. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Personally, I was very proud of the barcode reading technology I implemented on the iPhone and integrating that with online APIs to pull down information. Mark says he's just proud of himself in general. Now's not really a good time to ask us though, the lack of sleep has left us all a bit apathetic.

However, doctors can only use web to diagnose. As the smart phone popularizing, it is more convenience for doctors to diagnose the tongue figures via their mobile phone. Today, our team has built a mobile app for doctors.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The iTongue-doctor is an extensional app of iTongue for doctors. In this app, doctors can quick find and pick a case in the task pool to diagnose. A pdf medical certification can be created and send to the customs\u2019 email directly.   And also, doctors can see the records from what they have done.  Additionally, users can access to the doctors\u2019 calendar and make an offline appointment.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Both frond end and back end are involved to build this project.  First, the app user end is composed by the modules which show how many tasks are currently in the task pool for doctors and 4 buttons, which are tasks, records, calendar, and resource, to access different functions.  The number and conditions of the tasks in the task pool are called from the database built on AWS.  In our previous design, an app for patient users allow them to make app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We are not familiar with API. It took much longer than we expected. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have finished the draft vision for a whole mobile app in 24 hours. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The whole picture of mobile app development is learned by everyone in our team. From the front end user interactions to the back end database connections, we managed the process for doctor-patient activities, and gained a unique experience of making an app work.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ITongue-doctor</h2>\n<p>We will develop new modules like the Q&amp;A, user feedback survey. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CaesarQu/iTongueDoctor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CaesarQu/iTongueDoctor\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["geneFax", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>no finished, analyze gene sequence data</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PDirks/geneFax\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PDirks/geneFax\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Compassion In Need", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My inspiration really just comes from my own heart. I am an avid practicioner of meditation and the idea just came to me. I want to make a positive change in the world that has a lasting impact. Compassion In Need is my attempt at doing just that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Compassion In Need is a website free of ads and can be used free of charge. It is intended to connect like-minded people who are looking to improve their local community through their own proposed community projects. It all starts with an <em>idea</em>, just like anything else in our reality. Thought always comes before action. Users of the site will discuss the idea and this will lead the original poster (OP) to develop a <em>plan</em>. This plan includes all of the logistics in how to make the idea a reality. This includes how many (if needed) volunteers are needed, where it is taking place, when it will take place, how it will take place, why it will take place, permits needed(?), finances required, etc. Users will have the opportunity to make recommendations (comments for now) on how to make the plan better and the OP will approve/disapprove these recommendations. After all recommendations are exhausted or until OP decides, a master plan is finalized and it's on to the last step, the <em>event</em> . The event is simply the final product of your idea and plan in the form of physical action. So essentially, this is a platform for crowd-sourced community service.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I made a simple logo design before I came to HackMizzou and already registered the domain and installed Wordrpess through my host, Siteground. I didn't have anything on my site other than a rough philosophy page on what I envisioned the site to be. I built this site through Wordpress and made use of the plentiful plugins.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The hardest part about making my site was not knowing what I was doing at first. It took me hours of trial and error to get all (or most) of the features that I wanted to put on my site. A lot of what I wanted to do was easy to do with paid plugins, but I didn't have money to spend on that so I had to find workarounds.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am just proud that I didn't let my idea stay an idea. I made it manifest into reality. It's easy to dream, and it's so rewarding to make that dream come true.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that it's actually not that hard to make a website once you just push through some barriers. Wordpress is a lot more powerful tool than I thought it was.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Compassion In Need</h2>\n<p>Up next is an updated front page that will display a community funds pot. It will show donations to the site in real time and the pot will grow. The community funds will be distributed to the community projects that need them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wordpress\">wordpress</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">siteground</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://compassioninneed.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://compassioninneed.org\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>compassioninneed.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Foresight", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Distractions exist all around us from phones, to people, to just things that catch our eyes. When you add extreme weather, limited visibility, and grogginess, it's become apparent why so many people die each year from car crashes. We have been exposed to many horrific accidents like these, and we believe all crashes can be prevented. That is why we set out to develop a way to integrate innovative technologies and incentives to decrease the number of accidents while ensuring consumers of all economic status can afford our product.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using real-time light intensity for weather conditions, speed, reaction times, braking distance, and obstacle detection, we are able to formulate a reliable and accurate braking distances to alert drivers when they are too close to an object. There are three levels of alert status: blue, yellow, and red. Blue is when obstacles are far away, and the driver is in the safest conditions. Yellow indicates that it is possible to stop before colliding with an object, but there isn't a lot of time to do so. Red indicates immediate danger. This means that drivers could either stop with a little time of left or would collide if the object ahead stopped immediately. To alert drivers, we use both a back-lit LCD with text indicators and distinct colors, so drivers can be aware of their status without taking their eyes off the road. Furthermore, we included a loud beep with a red alert, so even distracted drivers with have their attention pulled back to the road. Finally, data from the drive is recorded and accessible by the driver and insurance companies so that good drivers can be rewarded, while all drivers can see how close they drove to obstacles to improve in future driving. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We constructed our system by using C programming on an Arduino 101. We implemented ultrasonic, potentiometer, LCD, buzzers, photoresistors, and a button to sense surrounding environments and display to user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a very large issue with one syntax error that was very time consuming. We also had to account for the inaccuracies and fluctuating values from sensors. Also, implementing certain libraries into our program were difficult because of compatibility errors. Finally, with our generally minimum exposure to hardware, it was difficult to incorporate it with our programs</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were most proud of our ability to develop the end product in the same light we imagined it in our first hackathon. We also got excited that we were able to incorporate so many variables that factor into driving accidents to ensure we can promote safety in drivers today. We were proud that we now are able to use hardware with programs we write.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use software and implement it with hardware.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Foresight</h2>\n<p>For the future of Foresight, we plan to expand the depth of the  software. We will create a website to push the data we pull for companies to easily access the information. Then companies that deal with insurance and car history can be always up to date with the data of vehicles. Additionally, we plan to incorporate more sensors to improve accuracy of the product.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nicoledillon/Foresight/blob/master/.ino\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nicoledillon/Foresight/blob/master/.ino\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nicoledillon/Foresight/blob/master/.ino\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nicoledillon/Foresight/blob/master/.ino\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Configured sensors and integrated them into the program.
