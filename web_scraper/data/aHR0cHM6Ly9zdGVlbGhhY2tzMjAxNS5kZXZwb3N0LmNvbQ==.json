The concept of an algorithm \"evolving\" has always been of interest to all the members on our team and so we thus decided to pursue a \"hack\" which involved the implementation of a genetic algorithm. Our project is able to take brainwave data (from Muse) and determine the relative state (calm/angry) of a person. Our project consists of presenting the user with a series of sounds which would change over time as the genetic algorithm evolved to create a consistent series of sounds which put the user in a more relaxed state. Our main audiences contain everyday people who want to handle stress better to big corporations who are interested in protecting their consumer data. With the ability to create unique user brainwave profiles, authentication can be extended to the field of biofeedback.</p>\n<p>TEAM MATES: Connor Curry, Ronak Patel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Leap Learn", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Leap Learn \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/234/165/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We are inspired by the ad of hololens where an engineer teaches a person how to repair a water tube remotely.

Our hack takes this idea to a whole new level by using rotating hand gestures in real-time to control where lines form.  Certain hand positions written into the program can also control things such as changing color or starting and stopping lines, among other features.

We decided to create an iOS app that linked people with similar interests into groups they could use to track things they're interested in (e.g., tech talks, free food, service opportunities) or want to avoid (e.g., crime, pollen, diseases).</p>\n<h2>What it is</h2>\n<p>Sighting is a crowdsourced extensible platform that users can use to track anything they want and find places they might be interested in- in real time. Users form groups they can use to monitor common interests- hackathons, interesting cars, sightings of Walter White- and be notified in real time when and where these events occur in their area. Our app has a simple user interface, a pleasant user experience, and even allows developers to automatically generate notifications.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Sighting uses an Objective-C-based front-end and a Flask backend that uses DynamoDB running on Amazon Web Services. Our code is currently public on GitHub.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Sighting has to tackle many problems due to its extensibility- unlike apps which are specific to weather reports, health data, traffic alerts, etc., Sighting allows users to monitor any topic of their interest over any geographic area. We have to account for an extraordinarily broad range of use cases and create a platform that allows users to mold their own Sighting experiences based on their own preferences. Beyond that, Sighting was built to be scalable and we spent a considerable amount of effort into building the perfect user experience that could work for all use cases.</p>\n<h2>Use cases</h2>\n<p><strong>Travelling to a new city</strong>: You know you like cheesecake and good scenery, but you don't quite know where to find it in Pittsburgh. On top of that, you've heard some things about crime and don't like crowded spaces. Just join these groups, alert others when you run into these issues, and enjoy a personalized map of the city to help you plan your excursion.</p>\n<p><strong>Health and crime tracking</strong>: One of the major benefits of Sighting is its ability to track the spread of diseases. By combining user-generated information with the power of automation and big data, Sighting allows users of all types (city residents, hospitals, police officers, Batman) to track the dangers of their local area and even broader regions to identify trends- both small-scale and large-scale.</p>\n<p><strong>A day in the life of a college hacker</strong>: Tech talks? Oh yeah, Facebook just had one on Thursday. Oh, you didn't know? Well, check out these awesome beanies and shirts they handed out. Yeah, I'll tell you next time. Wait. You can just join the Tech Talks group on Sighting to be alerted in real time about cool tech talks going on (or about to happen) in your area- and even find new ones if you go to a new location.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>As a product, Sighting is going to expand using the Yik Yak strategy- start local to go global. We believe college students are a solid demographic to begin with as they frequently access their phones and are highly likely to create alerts- they've also got interests within their local region and often spend their time looking around for parties, free food, cool events and avoiding drunk people, bad weather, and pollen. College students are also likely to be invested in their local community since they frequently move around within that area.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, we're integrating user-provided data with automatic feeds- which, to demonstrate just how extensible Sighting is, can simply interface with the same interface that users use. For example, a bot taking in Pittsburgh crime reports and creating Sighting alerts can provide a reliable and robust source of data for the Crime group.</p>\n<p><strong>But what about the chicken-and-egg problem?</strong> To encourage users to contribute and provide an initial (and ongoing) source of data, we've set up automated bots using various services (like city Open Data) to report and map information about disease, crime, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Alright. Did you do any customer validation?</strong> Yes! Given our plans for the initial userbase, we surveyed <strong>23 college students</strong> from various campuses (including UCLA, CMU, UT-Dallas, and Pitt). Of them <strong>21</strong> (91.3%) indicated they would use the app, <strong>16</strong> (70.0%) said they would actually pay for it ($0.99-$1.99), and <strong>19</strong> (82.6%) said they would use the public-facing API to harvest and add data.</p>\n<p><strong>Quotes from customer validation</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>\"Free food? Hell yeah.\" - student at CMU</em></p>\n<p><em>\"If it's going to save me money by finding free food, sure I'll pay for it.\" - student at Pitt</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Yes, I would use this for sports groups and men's fashion.\" - student at UCLA</em></p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of payment, what's the business model?</strong> Ah. A real biz dev question. While our focus was mostly technical, we did think up some rudimentary business models for the expansion of the project- in addition to charging users a small one-time fee for using the app (partially to also filter out spammers), we can also capitalize on the rich dataset and therefore monetize the API. Additionally, we can charge businesses who want to regularly use our platform to advertise their promotions- for example, if 7/11 wants to market their Slurpee promotion, they can pay a small fee to increase the visibility of their alert or to exceed a cap on the number of alerts they can generate within a group within a certain span of time.</p>\n<h2>The point</h2>\n<p>Sighting solves a very wide set of pain points by simply letting users track what they want to find and what they don't want to find. We believe our hack has the potential to make a massive impact by allowing an incredible wide array of people to track things they're interested in or want to avoid. Hospitals and health organizations can track diseases, people can work together to avoid crime or health hazards, and ultimately everyone gets a map of exactly what they want.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-dynamodb\">amazon-dynamodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apjaffe/Sighting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/apjaffe/Sighting\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xiaoxiao26/Sighting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/xiaoxiao26/Sighting\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["find(friends)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xsEQMZWq0bg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"find(friends) \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/234/160/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Adventures alone aren't nearly as fun as adventures with long-lost friends!

You will then be pitted against another player and their fighter. However, we did not have time to implement the actual game logic.

But Jirga, the new mobile friendly way to poll your friends, you can get help deciding anything from where to eat and what to wear to what courses to take and more. Public Jirgas and private Jirgas are available depending on what needs to be decided. The possibilities are limitless: want to create consensus within a group? Pick the brains of likeminded people? Jirga can do all of these things in a fast and simple way.</p>\n<p>What makes Jirga special is the ability for feedback that leads to intelligent reccomendations, or what we like to think of as wisdom. Have you ever had friends that offer consistently great advice? Imagine them all together in one place, acting as counsel for you. That's the power of Jirga! When a user asks a question, the ability to provide feedback is crucial. Would it be a good idea to take a course with a given professor? Or to jump off your roof into your pool and put it on Youtube? However these decisions turn out, you can give feedback to Jirga by choosing the vote that was right after you have gained the knowledge of hindsight. When you do so, Jirga will adjust the ranking of your friends to reflect who reccommended the right choice to you. For future questions, Jirga takes all of these past vote and feedback pairs into account and delivers a weighted reccomendation of what vote seems the best.\nThe details may be complicated but Jirga isn't. Create a profile, invite your friends, and start asking each other about the things that matter in your life.

The goal of this extension is to let the user access information about politicians more easily by displaying data about them above their name in web pages.  Our hackers quickly discover that JavaScript will be an essential part to creating this extension.</p>\n<h3>The Journey Begins</h3>\n<p>None of our hackers know any JavaScript and that is where their journey starts: learning JavaScript.  At first JavaScript is frustrating and confusing and then after several hours, it still is.  But the hackers don't give up and set out a plan for then next day.</p>\n<h3>Progress is Made</h3>\n<p>The new day is promising because mentors have arrived!  Two most excellent mentors help the hackers with JavaScript.  After many hours, some serious progress is made, especially thanks to the mentors.  One of the hardest parts was searching the webpages with JavaScript for specific tags and injecting tags and CSS attributes back into the DOM (to find and mark the politicians).</p>\n<h3>An Extension is Born</h3>\n<p>After lots of trial and error the extension is finally a real extension.  It can be used in a normal Firefox window.  The only thing separating it from a real extension is that it is not published (yet).<br/>\nCurrently in version 0.1 and in Beta Testing</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mozilla\">mozilla</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firefox\">firefox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">extension</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Pimp my Language", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pimp my Language \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/234/159/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Made by Shelley Goldberg, Nick Peluso, and Emilee Betz</p>\n<p>Pimp my Language started as a goofy project to convert Java to a made up programming language or from the language back to Java.
