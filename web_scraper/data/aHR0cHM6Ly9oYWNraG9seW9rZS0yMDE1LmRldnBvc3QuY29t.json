However, even in the year 2015, we still have an extremely difficult time communicating with the rest of the world. This app was inspired by the desire to be able to communicate with people who we might otherwise find impossible to communicate with. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hello-World is a mobile application that detects your speech and displays subtitles over a live stream. The app opens up to a live video stream and will detects when someone is speaking. As soon as it detects speech, it translates that speech to the subtitles in the language of your choice. In addition, we used sentiment analysis on the content of the speech to determine whether the speech was positive, negative, or neutral. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Android Studio and Microsoft Translator libraries to build the android app and translation functionality. We utilized Indico API's for the sentiment analysis.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One big challenge we ran into was getting the translation to work. After we had gotten the speech recognition, we needed to translate that data into the desired language, but doing so proved difficult because of the complexity of various API's we've tried to use. We did eventually find a solution with a library based on Microsoft Bing Translator.\nAlso, we could only implement speech recognition of English, and not other languages.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>After having four people work more hours than I can count on the same problem, we found a solution to translating the speech. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about how to send HTTP GET requests from android, various Android development, how to use Indico API's, and how difficult some API's can be to use.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hello-World</h2>\n<p>-Support for detection of more languages\n-Support for displaying more language-subtitles\n-Continuous detection of speech.\n-Creating this app on other platforms- Oculus, AR, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-translator\">microsoft-translator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Fanatic-Four/Hello-World\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Fanatic-Four/Hello-World\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Nectr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Nectr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/484/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of the team members had become really ill due to really bad food allergies to Mustard seeds that he was not really aware of at the time. Since he had to be rushed to the emergency room teammate Kyle had to sit with a UMass dietitian and she just went through a list of the meals for the weak and listed off what he could and could not eat. It came to Kyle that very day that instead of people having to deal with this problem, they should get the information sent directly to them and filed into their inbox on a daily basis. This is all done with no blockage on the the part of the email client. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sends a daily digest of all the possible foods the user can safely eat given their proposed allergens. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used several web scrapers to get the ingredients and food data from the respective schools. Then we used spring to abstract the process for our database and we wrote programs to make sure that the email digest is sent directly to the user's inbox and not in their spam folder. We then spent time building the interactive UI portal for user Registration and modification of their preferences. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had issues building the scripts to deal with email, since email is very wonky. Also, scraping the data was either very fast or very slow at times. One of our biggest issues was dealing with the dependencies and we had messy time with handling the work for the UI from the back-end when in hindsight in would have been better to handle everything on the client side, which we eventually did.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team we cam together and changed what looked like would be a mess, into a tangible product that we ourselves would even use, this is a really exciting experience</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about the necessity of scraping data for application purposes as well as the differences between various forms of programming the back-end.

The M5 community has been better fed and IEEE has generated more funds for hosting events since the creation of Ohm's. The only problem is: Logging all of our sales to do analysis on our sales. Hence the creation of the Ohm's Snack Shop Program.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Ohm's Snack Shop Program reads in a configuration file of the current inventory. A GUI then pops up and allows IEEE to log each sale based on item, amount, seller, and any comments. The program will then automatically add a time-stamp for the sale. Lastly, the sale will be added to a csv file storing all the data on Google Drive where it is synced with all of our other IEEE documents.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We converted our current Google Sheets files into csv files. We then created a python script that would combine the csv files into a single json file for our D3 analytic program to read-in.
