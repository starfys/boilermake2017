The emphasis is on teaching how to solve problems using programming concepts like loops and conditionals.  In Pro-Bot the problems are only how to navigate an obstacle course. But the type of thinking required will be the same used during coding. Design, test, iterate!</p>\n<p>Both the drone assembly and the programming are all made using blocks like Minecraft, giving users an easy concrete was to visualize programming. It is programming disguised as something all kids know and love.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Pro-Bot was built in Unity, with scripting in C#</p>\n<h2>What's next for

goal was to create a more user friendly experience for flying a drone. Instead of the conventional remote control, our aircraft receives instructions from the user's hand movements.</p>\n<h2>The Idea</h2>\n<p>The idea for this project came about from the discovery of a training port on the back of the drones remote control. This port allows two transmitters to be connected together for training purposes. After analyzing the signals of the transmitters, we were able to generate an identical signal which simulates a trainee signal. </p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>We constructed a pair of gloves attached with a BNO055 absolute position sensor. This position information is then accessed over I2C bus interface by our Atmega 32U4 microcontroller. Appropriate signal is generated from the processed information and sent over the transmitter to the quadcopter.  This arrangement allows a user to fly the quadcopter using only their hands. All the code for this project was written using AVR-C, debugging was done over USART.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The first struggle our team ran into was not allowing the sensors enough time to process all data.\nThe second difficulty was our exponential control function model. The calculation would have taken too long, so we constructed an array look up table to easily grab the tabulated values. We then ran into the problem that this array was too large for our 2.5 kB RAM. We had to save this table in our program memory and then access it during run-time.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Interface enables user to interact with a quadcopter more directly, making the flying feel more natural.</li>\n<li>Platform-independent interface - The interface we constructed is capable of controlling any radio-controlled device (plane, helicopter, quadcopter, car, boat).</li>\n<li>Fully customizable mapping function model - Our final draft of code uses a exponential model for our controls. This mapping offers greater stability and flight control by desensitizing small movements near the center (origin).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">avr-c</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jakeh12/hackisu-drone/tree/master/icarus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jakeh12/hackisu-drone/tree/master/icarus\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mostly on the implementation of I2C bus communication, USART, and PPM signal generation.

The hardware consists of an Arduino board that continuously collects data from weather sensors and posts it to a remote database.  There are two parts to the software aspect of this project: an application and a website. Both will retrieve data from the database via a PHP script on the server and Ajax. They will be formatted using jQuery Mobile Themeroller. The data harvested from the sensors will be timestamped automatically in the database. This will allow us to retrieve sets of data. That data will then be processed on each client to predict what weather is currently occurring, and displayed with gif images to represent the weather, accompanied by additional data. It will also be used to allow custom graphs for trend mapping.</p>\n<p>If you would like to try this out, click the link below, navigate to the \"Set Upload URL\" tab, and enter \"<a href=\"http://weather.javathehutt.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://weather.javathehutt.xyz</a>\".

But we never have the time nor the patience to do so. So here's something which does that for us and puts a smile on our face every time we walk down our memory lane. Well, we do know Facebook does that! But do we trust it enough to have our personal stuff on the internet? How would you like it if someone wrote your diary for you? Moments can be that one! :)</p>\n<p>Moments can access your call logs, message logs, calendar events, location and displays a timeline of all these events, which can be edited and saved with a text note or audio note. The app adds call logs that had longer duration and message logs with longer threads, which could be of significance to the end user. The app syncs with calendar and gets appointments that will appear on the timeline. The app also tracks the location of the end user and match with the appointment location to create a checked in event without having the user to enter them. </p>\n<p>The app was developed using Android Studio with a SQLite Database. The biggest challenge was to develop a location tracking service, which tracks your change in location and identify the kind of places you visit. The conversation tracker which breaks down user conversations into short and important ones, was critical too.</p>\n<p>What we learnt ? - What it takes to participate and complete a hackathon!</p>\n<p>The app can be extended to track user appointments and location to bring up missed events or appointments. It can also track user alarms, which can help it track user activities right starting from their beds in the morning. It can also be synced with Facebook to track user's social activities. The app can also prompt user notes based on the context of the event, like asking them \"How did your wife like the dinner?\" if there was an event \"Dinner with Wife at Chipotle\". The applications and extensibility of this app is numerous.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/somisettynaresh/Momento\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/somisettynaresh/Momento\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Combining IoT with Crowdsourcing in Disaster Response", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BiYXBHMat9M?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Combining IoT with Crowdsourcing in Disaster Response \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/725/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>System Overview</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  When it comes to the natural disasters, collecting as much data accurately in a timely manner is extremely critical. Today, one of the cheapest stream sensors to analyze a river's(or creek) water level costs $3000 each. Finding a way to gather wider information with a device which costs less than $5, would be tremendous success. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  It allows a person to accomplish a specified job where human input is necessary or useful, with literally minimal effort. And, it also provides a real-time, interactive, and friendly user interface by placing these data sources from various places onto Google Maps.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  To develop a proof-of-concept prototype, I benefited from Amazon's Dash Button by writing a sniffing program with Ted Benson's method. That method is, overtime the button has been pushed, Dash Button boots, connects to wifi, performs what it programmed to do, and shut off, due to energy saving purposes. By writing Python code that sniffs the network whether the Dash Button is activated or not. If so, I'm running my PHP code on the web which updates the my database, and records the details of that Dash Button(e.g. location, time, etc.). \n  To gather and monitor all these information, I developed a web page which configures Google Maps, and locate all Dash Button records on it by retrieving from postgresql. To increase the real-time effect, and avoid the need of refreshing the page to be able to see the new Dash Button records, I implemented probing which checks if there is any change on the db. If so, automatically updates the page without refreshing it.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  My first time project experience with Mac, Python, Dash Button, and Google Maps. A lot of things went wrong.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  It worked.\n\n  Being awake and work 3 days in a row.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  There are enormous amount of possibilities in IoT. Dash button is a lot more faster and well-equipped than I thought it would be. If this kind of hardware can be bought for $5 right now, in just a couple of years, IoT will be in every aspect of our lives.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What's next for Combining IoT with Crowdsourcing in Disaster Response</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Next step is to actually reprogram the Dash Button by deleting the firmware, implementing TCP/IP stack and utilizing WICED wifi module directly. \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-dash</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://s-iihr50.iihr.uiowa.edu/demir/knowledge/dashdemo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://s-iihr50.iihr.uiowa.edu/demir/knowledge/dashdemo/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>s-iihr50.iihr.uiowa.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Typo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Typo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/843/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Cool logo by Matt Evers</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>In a world where you go to your bathroom and your roommate takes the opportunity to strike by getting on your computer and posting on your Facebook, Typo is here to save the day. </p>\n<h2>What it is</h2>\n<p>Typo is a powerful tool that learns your typing 'fingerprint'.

We set out to change that by creating a service that helps people connect based on a mutual desire to learn a topic. Our goal is that our project will help people to inspire each other to build amazing things. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Meet assembly, a web site focused around topics. Sign up for an account and fill in things you are interested in (i.e. Javascript, Gardening, Woodworking, etc). You will then be presented with a curated list of projects and discussions that are relevant to you. You can share the projects that you are passionate about with the rest of the world as well as join in on engaging conversations. </p>\n<h2>How it was built</h2>\n<p>We built assembly using the new Angular 2 web framework. The entire application was written in TypeScript, and functions as a single page web app. The backend uses Java to serve a set of REST APIs to the web client. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Angular2 is an extremely new framework, and recently went from alpha to beta. As a result, there is very little documentation on the internet, and there are naturally bugs/difficulties that you have to work around. We had a particularly hard time working around an error in the Angular2 http client code, which is still under active development. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we were able to create a reliable and well-performing web application using the Angular 2 framework that we were all new to and that has a few issues. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This was one of the first times that any of us have gone into a hackathon with the entire team not knowing or having any experience with the core technology we decided to use. We quickly learned how effective learning as a group can be. </p>\n<h2>What's next for assembly</h2>\n<p>We plan to add additional features that integrate with other sites, such as GitHub. For instance, if someone posts a link to a project on GitHub, we are planning to display details about that project from their API.</p>\n<p>Also, we want to have more rich content on our web app, such as embedded images. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angular2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript\">typescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://jsmith-rs.ddns.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://jsmith-rs.ddns.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>jsmith-rs.ddns.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Frontend, navigation, networking", "", "", ""]], ["Restaurant Roulette", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Pretty simple.

Maximizing computational power and output is really fun, and working with 10's of thousands of pixels is an easy way to practice.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This app takes one whole photo and creates a separate photo that looks similar out of a chosen library or average color over a region.  The algorithm is a simple RGB distance calculator that compares each pictures average bit map RGB value with another, and returns the best one to display.  It uses multithreading to maximize the processing speed of the program by separating each cell into its own thread, and allowing it to work while it continues to operate.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built the GUI using JAVAFX and programmed the backend using regular old java.  All of the code in this project belongs to me except for the RGB distance formula that was provided by the wonderful stack overflow.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Multithreading can be challenging, especially when I have never used it before.  Populating so many images on a screen using multithreading is harder than I thought.  For reasons I am still unaware of the screen would not display certain cells after the thread had completed.  I had to instead use a simple O(n^2) for loop to solve the problem.  Also comparing RGB values efficiently is very hard to do.  At one point I did not think that I would ever get a real image from images because the algorithm was failing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I learned everything I planned on practicing before I came to HackISU.  My program works and the code behind it isn't too shabby.  I made sure that in the future I can continue to build this software, because I believe that I can really use it as a tool.  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Pixels are amazing.  We take for granted the beauty of these screens that we stare at and don't understand the complex structure that is taking place.  I would say I gained a ton of insight on color theory and how pixels render on a screen.  Also I learned the value of separating tasks through multithreading and how to stay awake for over 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Twohy's Photo Mosaic Creator</h2>\n<p>Add the ability to create a gif mosaic.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/twohyjr/PhotoMosaicMaker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/twohyjr/PhotoMosaicMaker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Foober", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanting food, but not wanting to to go get it yourself</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Lets you post \"orders\" to a mobile site, where people can accept the order and deliver it to you for a small fee</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using the Meteor framework allowed us to host the server for the site, and the API's provided a lot of functionality.

We performed date/assignment extractions using a variety of techniques for the different date/assignment formats. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Dates and assignments can take on a wide variety of formats, and professors may not be consistent within their own syllabi. Similarly, deciding which statements are assignments and which are filler text proved to be a problem, although not insurmountable.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to adapt Syllabot to accommodate the most common assignment formats that professors use. We also provided a file that users can easily import to a scheduler of their choice.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Certain date/assignment formats are substantially easier to accommodate than others. Regular expressions can help in that regard, but not for all formats.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Syllabot</h2>\n<p>An expanded set of supported date/assignment formats, as well as support for reading .pdf and .doc files.

This is where the team drew its main inspiration from. The real question about who is the more successful human being is not always who can solve a random three dimensional puzzle faster, but who can spend 36 hours in attempt to have a mobile phone do it for us.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>KewbApp uses the Open Source Computer Vision Library, or openCV, allowing the user to scan and image the six faces of a Rubik's cube. The app then parses RGB data and averages each of the colored squares, before placing the closest color representation into a Cube data structure. This data structure also supports face rotations and transformations. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Utilizing Android-Studio and the Android SDK alongside Java Frameworks and Libraries such as OpenGl and OpenCV, we began developing this application until it quickly reached developmental plateau... Then returned in a blaze of glory; the team now well-rested and raring to continue.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initial the application planned to find either a general or optimal solution for via search algorithms against a mapping of the sub-cubes relationships. This proved to be difficult as the initial plans for the cube's data structure did not take into account the need for search.\nOur implementation of OpenCV's image recognition gave us problems with different lighting as the color threshold were dependent on RGB values instead of HUE. \nRotation of any given face was another trial, due to the data structure. As the puzzle is six sided no single origin can be placed, therefore a rotation about one face must consider the changes to the four adjacent faces.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The introduction to image recognition software has opened up a vast amount of programming projects for each of us. Cleaning up memory leaks and managing memory in general. The project as a whole instills pride and fear in the hearts and minds of a nation one Rubik's cube at a time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The importance of planning the minute aspects of the project extensively such as the format of image files and data structures. The true meaning of friendship... probably?</p>\n<h2>What's next for KewbApp</h2>\n<p>The above stated learned information has show us that this similar technology could be used in other puzzles such as Sudoku and mazes of varying complexity without needing to tackle a puzzle with such high complexity like the Rubik's Cube. This technology can also be applied to our previous HackISU project know colloquially as Pizza Trip.

In this you had to take care of monsters and enter them into competitions. The end goal was to have some sort of fighting system like the original game but one person can only do so much.\nI did this in Javascript mostly to push myself to try a new language. I have done some fiddling with JS before but nothing this massive.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>At the moment, you can move monsters between rooms and each room does something different. Each time the room's actions activate, the monster's stats change and a small notification appears on the monster. A health-bar will also change.</p>\n<p>Each monster also wanders around and will collide with walls.</p>\n<p>As a fun little test, I added the live status of the monsters. It is actively updated so every stat change is instantly shown.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>With JavaScript and Phaser, a free open source JavaScript Game engine. Phaser handles the drawing of the sprites and physics.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning JavaScript and Phaser by myself. I was unable to split the tasks up and had to keep in mind a linear order for creation. Not that I could not skip around, but I was actively learning while writing so I worked on problems until fixed.</p>\n<p>I also learned that not all physics engines are made equal. Part way though, I lost several hours b/c I discovered the default Physics Engine for Phaser is not able to handle collisions like I wanted and did not have sophisticated enough checking to accomplish my goals. The hours spent on redoing my entire system did make me learn though.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Utilizing a physics engine. This is the first time I have even used a game engine, let alone a physics engine. So learning the strengths of each one and changing my entire program's skeleton to use it was a daunting task. But I survived and so did Monster Field.</p>\n<p>I'm also proud that learned a great deal about JavaScript and its weakly typed variables. It was a shock to find that several times my number was taken as a string.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about JavaScript and its many different uses.

Our original goal was to simulate the feeling of causing an object to levitate using an oculus rift. The original plan was to build a room in unity and use an oculus rift to suspend the player in a room full of boxes. The player would have been able to look at a box and using the muse headband, make a box levitate without touching any other input device. Unfortunately due to hardware constraints, we were unable to use the oculus rift, and instead made a balloon popping simulator.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Focus allows you to use your mental concentration to pop a virtual balloon.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The muse headband provides many OSC streams, that allow you to gather a lot of data about your brain. One of these streams is your \"concentration\" level. The balloon is static as you continue to focus on it, and once your \"concentration\" reaches a certain level, the balloon pops.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Unfortunetely we spent most of the first 10 hours of the hackathon trying to get an oculus rift to work on our laptops. Because of this constraint we were not able to complete our original goal,  but decided to stick with muse, in order to gain knowledge of the system.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Neither of us had interfaced with OSC before, nor had we analyzed brain waves. It was very satisfying to watch a sphere move across the screen without touching anything for the first time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the value of researching hardware compatibility before deciding on a project, and organizing a plan before the event.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Focus</h2>\n<p>We are still very excited about our original plans to integrate the muse headband in a 3d environment via oculus rift.

It has an audio player that is currently running a very simple mp3 file (one of people working).</p>\n<h2>How we built it:</h2>\n<p>Since the station requested that we use HTML5 and have the app available across multiple platforms, we installed the Apache Cordova framework and used a Visual Studio extension to develop our project. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into:</h2>\n<p>The streaming file that was sent to us was an M3u8 extension and would not work within the HTML5/CSS/JavaScript setting. This file was actually a script that linked to a third-party website and accessed a feed that contained a play list. We were not able to convert the file to an acceptable extension (mp3, mp4, etc). We tried several JavaScript plugins and code, but to no success. We also learned that the radio station's server has not been updated for HTML5, and this could be causing some complications.  For now, we just placed a single mp3 file as a placeholder in the app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of:</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our front-end designer. She fully customized the background and created her own placeholder and Facebook icons. Additionally, we came in with extremely little knowledge of application development and no knowledge of node.js, Cordova, or the Visual Studio extension we used, but diligently worked through each problem and client request. We still developed an interface that we can take back to the radio station and develop further with an upgraded server and access to additional stream files.</p>\n<h2>What we learned:</h2>\n<p>We learned about node.js, Cordova's framework, new tools and the emulator capabilities of Visual Studio. We also learned that audio file extensions do not work across all platforms, and developers need to have multiple sources for compatibility. Also, we learned that there is a time to put a project on hold. We completed the GUI interface and then put the project aside for the remaining 12 hours of the competition. At that time, we delved into something that has always interested us, but we were too hesitant to try on our own. We have been working on learning Unity game design for the second half of our time here. (Oh, and we are still researching our live stream problem!)</p>\n<h2>What's next for 89.7 The River:</h2>\n<p>We would like to finish the build with the client, if they like the direction we were heading.

However, it wasn't until about 2am on Saturday that we learned it's impossible due to Javascript preventing that functionality for security reasons.</p>\n<p>So, we did the next best thing.

The primary goal of our project is that we used the twitch interface to control the movement of a motorized robot in a forward, left, and right motion. Which in theory is simple, but in reality, well, is not. Secondly, as bit of a last minute feature we decided we'd like to hook up one of our phones to the robot, and film it's journey and relay it back to the twitch live stream. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built this project using <strong>Twitch.tv</strong>, <strong>Arduino Boards and Arduino Language</strong>, and <strong>python</strong> </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into several unexpected issues. First we ran into several problems with the arduino boards compatibility, and the personalized arduino langues. In an attempt to make the project as cheap as possible we bought them in mass and ended up getting a faulty arduino board and it took a while to find the problem. The biggest issue, however, was soldering and setup of the arduino boards. This was very time consuming, and we accidentally made a couple of mistakes with wiring and soldering. Another challenge was learning how to effectively use the nano boards to get the output we wanted, and ended up spending a lot of time sifting through header files to learn new information.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we were able to take take an exciting software idea (twitch stream), and apply it in a unique way to run a robot.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>As a team we learned to communicate as much as possible, and to let each other do what we're best at in peace.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TwitchBot</h2>\n<p>RideWithTwitch ideally will sometime in the future have four wheels and be able to have complete control of its motion.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on format, robot style, initial setup of arduino code, and initial setup of arduino board", "Worked on python script to get  inputs from twitch stream.

When you're connected, you can control the car that's running Node.JS with GPIO integration to control the vehicle.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we decided to collect data on drivers to train a Deep Convolutional Neural Network to see how well we could get the vehicle to drive on its own for a given task (be it following a track or avoiding objects.) </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We bought two RC cars at WalMart, some RPis and breadboards and went to town. We followed a tutorial online to get it up and running with python - and then ported the code over to Javascript on a Node Server. </p>\n<p>Setting up the RPis to broadcast their own SSID was a task in and of itself. We had to setup DHCP servers to assign IPs to connecting clients so they could communicate with the Pi.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Neural Network was a combination of OpenCV for machine vision/image processing and TensorFlow for the NN framework. We ended up having to create a TCP connection and Video Stream between the Pi and a laptop computer as TensorFlow doesn't run on a 32bit architecture. So the Pi would stream video that the laptop would consume, classifying the stream frame by frame - and then sending commands to the Pi - effectively acting as a cloud based decision making platform.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Oh were there a ton! For a while we had problems reading data from the Raspberry Pi camera - which took the better half of a day to get working correctly. Beyond that, configuring the Pis to broadcast an SSID ran into several hiccups with the networking connection on campus. We weren't able to download/update node packages for a while - ultimately leading us to have to reformat one of the pis and start from scratch.</p>\n<p>Finally, after 9 hours of development around the Neural Network - we found out that the Pi couldn't run the code. So we had to create the \"cloud based\" solution mentioned above.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Overall, this project was a great learning experience. We really enjoyed seeing the pieces come together one by one - and we're especially proud of the many different technologies we touched to stand this project up.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This was a great learning experience. A major take away was that a sturdy wireless connection is key - and the iterative development pays off!</p>\n<h2>What's next for CyDriver</h2>\n<p>We don't have any immediate plans for CyDriver - but it would be very interesting to see how well our vehicle performs on different tasks. Additionally, creating a cluster of pi cars that think collectively would be awesome.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tcp\">tcp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">deep-neueral-networks</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Mrparkers/CyDriver\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Mrparkers/CyDriver\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the machine vision, image processing, and neural network implementation.

While it was fun, we were a bit flustered at the beginning trying to figure out what we could get done in only 36 hours. Not only was it our first hackathon, but we decided to make a website, something that we (having more experience with back-end development than anything else) had little to no experience with.</p>\n<p>_ Program Sharing _ - Our team decided to use dropbox for our program sharing needs. The only downside is that only one person could work on a file at a time, and if someone saved, the progress someone else had made was lost. Thankfully we didn't run into this too much, and we all have pretty good short term memory, </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>_ Learning _ - Our team accomplished a lot of learning this week. We really felt that our programming abilities were pushed to new limits in ways that traditional classwork and exploring doesn't do as efficiently. </p>\n<p>_ End Result _ - We were very pleased with the end result of our coding. Our website runs and has quite a bit of functionality. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>_ Python _ - We learned that python has a lot of really useful properties when dealing with web sites. After using python in ways that we hadn't before, it regains its shine and reminds us that its place in the world of programming is valid. </p>\n<p>_ Communication _ - Constant communication is key for projects on a time limit. It was already hard enough to understand each other in a room full of people trying to do the same, let alone taking down difficult instructions and assignments on what needed to be done. If we didn't have a way to communicate over the computer, I'm sure we would have given up a lot sooner. Instead, we made it through the whole weekend. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Team Thunder Squirrels</h2>\n<p>_ Continuation of Website _ - Our team plans on making our website more functional and cleaner cut in the future. As for hackathons, three out of four of our teammates are sophomores so three of us can come back every year to make even better projects. This hackathon was a wonderful experience and we're glad we got to come to HackISU to make this project possible. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cherrypy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kickstart</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]]]
