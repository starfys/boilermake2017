We came with the desire to make a difference while we learn. MyStory is a charity with a very small team but a big impact. However, they rely on pen and paper to collect data for a critical part of their process. That's a problem even we can solve!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>NewStoryStore is a storage site for data waiting to be uploaded to a cloud server. When we found that NewStory has iPads on the ground we were curious why they weren't using them already. \nNewStoryStore also serves as our reason to believe that file management is tricky.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Tutorial after tutorial we followed our plan of breaking our high-level goal into discrete steps. We followed a lead with MicrosoftAzure, who had a good collection of guides that promised off-line data sync. In the process we deployed and integrated a sql database that synchronized todo-list items across all of our computers. We later deployed a blob database to approach our goal from another angle while we explored xcode development for the first time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our plan for offline data sync worked on the premise that we create a local SQLite that we later merge with the main DB when we have access to internet and the cloud. This plan was great if we are dealing with simple text but our case was different. MyStory does not only share text, they need pictures and videos to be sharable. We found out that this was not practical for an SQL database. \nOur plan for blob storage solved the data type problem. Blobs can be anything, we can store anything. However, the Azure guide for blob storage integration seemed to be out of date. Updates in xcode changed some critical library dependencies. Although more experienced iOS developers might have overcome this challenge, this was a wall that changed our goal of a live demo to the realization that we'd be delivering an explanation.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We sent messages through a text field that showed up on all of our screens.\nWe added pages to our UI\nWe explored even though it was scary\nWe endured</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Nothing is simple... but it can be broken down to something that it. Iterative progress gets you places</p>\n<h2>What's next for NewStoryStore</h2>\n<p>Blob storage is a good step forward. To achieve offline storage we could implement a table of items to be uploaded when connectivity is possible. \nBluetooth sync can be useful if connectivity is not possible for long durations. This could enable users to work together  and/or back up data on other devices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ImJohnDoe/StoryStore.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ImJohnDoe/StoryStore.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["NewStoryDataEntry", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We heard about New Story's struggle about offline data transfer and felt we could develop an app that help ease this process.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app is able to create new families for New Story's project.

Just as the pH scale measures the acidity or alkalinity of a solution, the extension aims to measure the risk of harassment on a website. Furthermore, our goal was to integrate the IBM Watson API to analyze highlighted text on the webpage to take sample \"trollinity\", or potential harassment level, of web content. Trollinity would also be building a database of this harassment data to build a source of data for other apps and organizations to use.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Trollinity was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, along with the Chrome JavaScript API and IBM Watson API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was integrating the IBM Watson API into the actual extension. We realized half-way through our project that we needed to create a separate web application, and have our extensions use this web app's API to query the Watson API, and relay the data back. </p>\n<h2>What we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team had little to no front-end development experience. None of us have ever built a Chrome extension, and have never queried an API before.

After writing an entry, the user is provided with an analysis of their emotions in easy to read bar charts. They are also provided with a custom message and suggestion.</p>\n<p>In the event that the user has shown signs of trauma, our app comforts them and provides them with resources for support.</p>\n<p>Journl also saves all of the user's past entries, and provides comprehensive personality analysis information. The user can seek to understand themselves and observe changes.</p>\n<p>Journl assists with this process by providing a visualization of the last five entries, sortable by one of four emotions. In this way, the user can easily see the change in their emotions over the past entries. Any of these data-points can be clicked, bringing the user to the journal entry in question.</p>\n<p>In summary: **journl provides customized support resources and emotional feedback, as well as comprehensive short-term and long-term analytics to provide the user with every opportunity to understand themselves. </p>\n<p>Journl is also a safe space for all users, and provides support flows and resources to the victims of harassment and bullying, as well as those who are suffering from depression or thoughts of self-harm.**</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Journl is built on the IBM Bluemix platform. It makes use of two cognitive APIs--the Watson Personality Insights API and the Watson Tone Analyzer API. Journl stores entries in a database where they are processed by a Node.js server.</p>\n<p>Journl makes use of supportive psychological techniques, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy and positive psychology. Journl is built as a single-page web app in order to provide a sleek and easy experience for the user.</p>\n<p>Journl's UI and interactions are all custom-built in Javascript, JQuery, and HTML/CSS. Graphs are built to be minimalistic and visually pleasing, with interactive features that make them fun to explore. Journl makes use of extensive asynchronous operations, and seeks to minimize loading times with a clever flow.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A primary challenge in this application was constructing appropriate messages for the user. Some of the users of Journl may be victims of harassment or otherwise suffering. It was important that we support them while providing actionable questions for exploring their feelings.</p>\n<p>Another challenge was considering how best to use Watson's personality data. Ultimately, it was decided that a personal message would help the user make sense of the data, a retrospective graph of the last five entries would provide comparative analytics, and sorting was involved to eliminate insignificant pieces of data.</p>\n<p>Because Journl's UI is built from scratch, there were also challenges involved in design and implementation. For example, the design of bar charts provided a challenge: how best to convey information while not cluttering the UI. Ultimately, the maximum value is always shown, while the user can scroll over any bar to gain more information. This required several overlays and dynamic operations, including changing z-ordering, which provided technical challenges.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This is a feature-rich and impactful application that walks a challenging and mature emotional line. We are very proud of both the concept and the execution. We are also proud of the custom-made analytics offered to the user, built on the powerful Watson APIs, which we had not used before.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We had never used Node.js or IBM Bluemix. We had never designed a single page application. We had never undertaken a project for which sensitivity was so important. We learned extensively about web-design, rapid prototyping, language specifics, API specifics, UX for psychological health, and how to make good design tradeoffs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for journl</h2>\n<p>Journl should be a free or crowdfunded platform. The next steps are to build out the web application and to build custom machine learning software for sentiment and tone analysis, then to use that library as the basis of the Journl platform.</p>\n<p>Another thing we will implement is gamification. Users should be rewarded for their positive journaling activities with badges, custom UI elements, and other habit-building rewards.</p>\n<p>Journl is built to help anyone. We believe that positive psychology and good design, coupled with powerful analytics, will help people to understand themselves better, to feel supported, and to always have a safe space.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a

I'm the kind of person interested in mechanical design and inventing while Hershel is an electrical engineering student with a passion for tinkering around with sensors and software. It was also Josh's first hackathon though he has a wealth of experience as the robotics club president and all around competent engineer, he offered to help us, and eventually joined our team afterward. Our game plan was simple though: we wanted to build something we would have want to use. We were particularly fascinated by the sensors, and also being in the ARC for HackDavis made us think a lot about the gym. Poor technique/form in exercising with equipment is one of the most prominent causes of injury. However, the sensors in the hardware room were not sufficient enough to cover all aspects of the body we wanted to evaluate, as well as detecting muscle strain is quite difficult. Josh, who actually lifts, could confirm this.</p>\n<p>As athletes (tennis for me, badminton for Hershel) who have dealt with physical strain, injury, and resulting therapy, we saw potential in turning the MYO armband into a versatile medical device. We took this idea further by creating Joint Effort- an application that bridges human-computer interfaces with physical therapy. The module we developed is merely a small piece of what Joint Effort can be, given more time- a powerful, open-source application filled with modules that exercise different parts of the body, and for different individuals who want to upload what works for them. However, for the sake of the 24 hour hackathon, we only got demo module done as a prototype and proof of concept that yes, the armband is receptive to our code. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Joint Effort aims to use electronic wearables to improve physical therapy, as such technology has many capabilities \nThe modules are presented on a computer screen, where successful completion of the exercise on the screen allows you to advance to the next. The exercise will not proceed unless you do the actions sequentially that are displayed for the exercise. You will receive onscreen or physical feedback (through vibrations) if you repeat the movement correctly (we are still working on this feedback feature.) The wrist/hand exercise therapy module utilizes the MYO armband to detect muscle movement as well as hand gestures; unlike just watching and imitating videos, we hope our application can actually deliver feedback, as it detects poor form. Also for some reason, devpost does not want to link to our website. <a href=\"http://joint-effort.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>After acquiring the MYO we began to search for code we could use that would program it. Many of the mods for MYO, notably Myoscript were Lua based, so we played around with the different handles and actions. Using Lua we made the framework for our code, which was done over in C++, since the language fit the mission better. Currently we are attempting to create a UI, that will be consistently improved in the future. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the MYOS to obey me as its master was physiologically difficult- I have very slender wrists. Calibration was easier for Hershel, who still experienced difficulty with it. The MYOS has a lot of room for improvement as hardware- it is sort of hard to execute fine motor maneuvers with it and sometimes gets false readings for gestures. Implementing a UI with our raw code was extremely difficult since none of us were familiar with Lua, but eventually (as I speak now) we are trying to translate the our raw code from Lua to C++, which Josh helped us do toward the final hours of the hackathon. Our rough product made for HackDavis is a Windows Command Prompt.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As first time hackathoners, we were proud of never giving up and encouraging one another. Hershel refined his skills in C++, worked on his programming confidence, and really took initiative with this project. We aren't coders for school, just picked it up on the side along with our engineering classes (though Matlab is an engineering staple) so we didn't know exactly what to expect with HackDavis. Personally I am so glad that I got to make new friends here, as well as learn Lua/ hacking a MYOS from the ground up. Thought it was amazing we got a piece of hardware that none of us had ever seen before and could write code to interact with it. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Well I finally learned exactly why programming is so useful- I've always been a hardware type of person and learning more about software is extremely intimidating. We learned that it's always helpful to ask questions, just ask a ton of them and Google them up, even if they sound stupid. We learned that the MYOS existed, I had no idea it did until I visited the hardware room. Also learned how humbling coding is, there's always a better way to do it than the one you're doing most of the time. Most importantly- don't give up on your project! We definitely felt like nothing could happen a few times, but ended up getting a lot farther than we ever though we would. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Joint Effort</h2>\n<p>More wearables and modules! Today we were only able to produce a demo of what this could become with some simple wrist exercises, but is so much to be done with the rest of the body. Developing sensors or using wearables that interact with computers can yield a wealth of information- if we had more time we would have developed a quantitative feedback mechanism that could send real-time information to another device such as a computer or Android. This data could test the effectiveness of Joint Effort therapy. We hope to expand on this idea and hack other sensor technology- the end goal is to even possibly develop our own sensor tech, program/application, and make it accessible and affordable. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">myoscript</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://literaljointsavings.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://literaljointsavings.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>literaljointsavings.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HersheyBear/wrist-therapy-myo/commit/9a770f9b715d07fef4f7021af64ba7396c77c577\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HersheyBear/wrist-therapy-myo/commit/9a770f9b715d07fef4f7021af64ba7396c77c577\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Programming the user interface and designed the original program structure.", "", ""]], ["Life Saver", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Life Saver \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/385/110/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Profile Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Life Saver \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/385/111/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>After tap help</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Life Saver \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/385/112/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Contact Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Life Saver \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/385/115/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Main Screen </i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A few years ago, a relative of one of our team members got a stroke.

We wanted to create an app to combat this issue.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a very simple Android app with which a user can preset information (such as contact information, medical information, etc.). During an emergency, the user would only need to press down on the large red HELP button in order contact his or her family or friends.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Android and using Twilio to send the message. The application also use the gps location from the phone and send it to receiver in order to call for help.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We tried to implement both texting (SMS) and facebook messaging, but ran into a lot of trouble with both. We ultimately decided to scrap the facebook part and just focus on the SMS portion of our project.\nWe were working with Twilio but have several issues with Twilio sdk. Unfortunately, we didn't find anyone with Twilio and Android experience to help.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We completed the GUI and location retriever for the app. Even though we didn't finish SMS function but we learned about RESTApi and Twilio. We learned more about Android development and worked as a team. We won the cup stacking challenge.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about package management and the important of api documentation.

the police to possibly stop harassment also. We realized it will be difficult to contact the police if you're caught in a dangerous situation.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We created an idea of a band on an arduino that detect button presses simultaneously or separately, which are allowed only once in a certain period. We also have an idea of an app where a person can create an account and will set his/her emergency contact information, and will show nearby crimes recently, however, it was not fully implemented.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The hardware was built with the Arduino 101 for its bluetooth feature. It is connected to two buttons, which with an algorithm, one can press the buttons simultaneously or separately, and it will contact either their 911 or emergency contact. We also have designs done for the phone app, and have tried to implement parts of the app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Android Studio was definitely our biggest challenge. We were trying to learn Android Studio, since all of us are new to Android Studio.

As college students, ride sharing is very common due to budget constraints. However, the current system in place on Facebook has a very poor setup due to the limitations of Facebook in organizing a large system of requests and replies. Our hope is to (eventually) create an app that would provide a more intimate and less hectic communication between drivers and riders.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Riders and drivers sign up for separate accounts. Riders send out the requests, drivers see the requests and message the riders. Riders then message back and confirm with the driver. Drivers can also post their availability status.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Sick Rides on a web browser, and we used Bootstrap, Javascript/jQuery, HTML5/CSS3 for front-end. For back-end, we used PHP and MySQL with phpMyAdmin as a GUI to handle the large databases. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a submission problem. We tried to create our domain, sickrides.tech (or .org), but the site would not let us; therefore, we were unable to deploy our code onto the domain. :-( </p>\n<p>We tried implementing a Chatbot AI into our web server, but ran into some errors. We also had never set up a local web hosting service on our computer, so that was a fun challenge to set that up. Some data types in SQL are not well represented, like the time of day, so we had to work hard to figure out an efficient way to store that data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It was a learning experience for the both of us.

Many districts around the country teach sex ed using different approaches, with whatever resources they have available being a major factor in determining their approach. One of our team members was given a RealCare animatronic baby to take care of for 24 hours in their 8th grade science class. While this is a hands on way to teach students about the important responsibility that comes along with having a child, it is not an opportunity that can be afforded by many schools. Thus, we aimed to create a mobile app that broadened access to the technology of the infant care simulator while creating a more holistic approach to sex ed. Through our mobile application, districts and teachers would be able to incorporate KASEY as an assignment within their current sexual education and health curriculum.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>KASEY is envisioned to serve as a graded assignment within a class. Within an assigned period of time, the teacher can monitor the students responses(particularly the amount of time it takes to respond) to the randomly generated cries. In addition to responding to the cries with the four commands(feeding, diaper change, burping, and rocking) students are instructed to answer a multiple choice question. These questions serve to further educated the students about consent, contraception, STIs/STDs/HIV/AIDS, and healthy relationships.\nAnother important aspect of KASEY is its inclusivity. We purposely made the infant in the app gender neutral. Each infant is named KASEY and each student is assigned a randomly generated race of infant. On top of that, the multiple choice questions are created to educate and include all genders and sexes, especially LGBTQ communities.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our demo using HTML and CSS from scratch and hosted our app on github. In order to view our app on our iphones, we used the application 'Cordova Browser'. For our graphics we used Adobe Illustrator CC on a MacBook and a Surface tablet. All graphics were also made from scratch.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many technical challenges as first timers. We overcame many of those problems by working cohesivly as a unit in addition to asking for guidnace from other hackers and sponsers.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are all very proud that we are first time hackers and were able to complete a demo of our project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it is not always going to go as planned, but making quick yet informed decisions can pay off in the long run. </p>\n<h2>What's next for KASEY</h2>\n<p>We hope to see this as a viable option for sexual education in middle and high schools.

By combining this data with online research, we were able to code our app using Pebble SDK 3 on a Pebble Time rented from the Hardware Lab.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app combines two aspects of physical well-being: exercise and diet. We want to make people aware of the time and effort it takes to burn off, let's say, a few M&amp;M's or a single donut. With each calorie burned, a meter on the watch screen fills, approaching a milestone. After the user reaches a milestone, the application congratulates the user and displays a photo of the food equivalency of calories burned at that point. These milestones provide an intuitive sense of something more than just a number of calories. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>All members of the team are first-year students, participating in our first Hackathon. The majority have never worked on a GUI-based project, so the first hours of the Hackathon consisted of learning how to incorporate our ideas into the Pebble.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>First, we are so proud that we managed to complete a prototype at our first hackathon. We applied our knowledge and were able to work together as a team to reach our goal of making our idea a reality.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As a team, we learned how to synthesize our ideas and apply them to achieve our goal of making an app. Mostly it was a long night of research and learning together!

We wanted to help this situation by building a haven for stressed-out students to come and be understood without being judged. We wanted our program to understand the person on the other side of the computer, thus giving us the idea to include emotional analysis with our program as well as proactive images.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The first thing our program does is create an API call to Cisco Sparks to set up a chat room with a bot in it named Raine. It prompts the user to type in an email address so the user can talk to the bot. The user and the bot will both be in the chat room. It uses the Python module Request and Oauth to authenticate both the bot and the user into the chatroom. This was exceptionally difficult to pull off because we had a hard time figuring out how to distinguish our authentication keys from other elements and how to use it with Python to get Cisco to acknowledge our users. Whatever messages the user sends to the bot will be sent to a script that calls the IBM Watson Tone Analysis API to analyze the message for emotional content. Watson will decide what is the greatest emotion that is displayed by the user through his/her messages and then based on those emotions, Watson will come up with a proper response to alleviate negative emotions or reinforce positive emotions. We can run as many clients as we want at the same time and it only takes one computer. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The IBM Watson Tone Analysis script was done in Python and uses the server credentials generated by Bluemix to call the API into Python. The script then inputs the text from the user and has the Toner Analysis tool analyze the message into a JSON output. The script then parses the JSON output, comparing emotion scores to find the max.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Wanted a wide variety of responses using IBM Watson Dialog API, but not enough time. Wanted audio and video but not enough time. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Managed to get API calls to IBM Watson's Tone Analysis tool and parse JSON output for the most expressed emotion. Also managed to learn how to use IBM Watson's Dialog tool but didn't implement it. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Hey Raine</h2>\n<p>We hope in the future that the messages the user inputs will be accompanied by images that correspond to the emotions, and they will change based on how the user changes his/her emotions throughout the chat session. We did not have enough time to implement them however. We also want to add text to speech and speech recognition of the user's voice. Also multilingual capabilities would be implemented as well including training cognitive APIs to detect sign language. \nAs the program grows, we can train it with data and get it to be more humanlike.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ibm-bluemix-and-watson-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cisco-spark-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/heyraine/website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/heyraine/website\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend with Python to implement IBM Watson's Tone Analysis tool into the web app and give Raine her emotion detecting skills", "I woroked on the front-end Django web app & some backend coding.

After looking at various documentation  for the APIs that would be present, we found Watson's innovative cognitive abilities to be interesting. So we decided to use it. When Teach for America gave its talk during the opening ceremony, we felt that we had a solid solution to the problem of tailoring teaching material based on grade level. Using Watson, we set out to hack a solution to education.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Quiz.sh uses Watson's AlchemyAPI to scrap content from Wikipedia pages and generate questions for the user to answer. The user can select a topic and the web application will query our database to output questions based on the specified topic. For now, it only scraps scientific content, and our mathematical questions were generated using a Java program. But the combined content is able to give our database a solid basis of questions to query from. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We split the tasks up into parts: frontend, backend, and data parsing. We each worked on a separate task and merged our files at the end to create our application. The frontend was built using HTML, JavaScript, and some CSS and uses the Rails controller to query the backend. The backend was built on a Rails app and uses Postgresql to hold the database. The data parsing was done with a Python script that uses the Watson AlchemyAPI to get content. The content were then exported as JSON files to parse and insert into the database.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Postgresql and Ruby on Rails were not inserting into the database as expected: only one tuple was stored into the database even though the program sets variables to different values through each iteration. We also had trouble formatting the Wikipedia content into feasible questions. Linking the front and backend was also troublesome. Possibly the hardest part was getting Rails and Postgresql working on, and in the end, only two computers had it running; also setting up the database and Rails app from scratch was difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made a decent prototype and accomplished almost all the tasks we set out to do. We also equipped our prototype with enough content to expand and be more robust should we develop it more in the future. It's also flexible in a way that, with a little more development, it can work with any topic you give the application.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned more about Ruby on Rails, how to deploy a Rails app, more about JavaScript, connecting the front and backend to allow interaction, and developing in a team.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Quiz.sh</h2>\n<p>We're planning to add sub-categories, varying difficulties, different question formats, and implement a better UX/UI.   </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/alchemyapi\">alchemyapi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/cottonycloud/hackdavis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/cottonycloud/hackdavis\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on building a working front-end prototype, and integrating that with Ruby on Rails", "", "", ""]], ["Meerkat Learning", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meerkat Learning \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/385/003/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meerkat Learning \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/385/001/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Class chat room</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meerkat Learning \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/385/002/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Group projects</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As UC Davis students, we frequently use online resources and technology for our classes.

We also added features to emphasize some of the subtle techniques that a good driver should know.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Unity game engine to build a world where traffic rules are enforced and good driving practices are encouraged. We used the Oculus Rift DK2's eye tracking capabilities to check where the driver is looking. For controlling the car, an Xbox 360 controller was used. We wanted to use a steering wheel, but didn't have one. For acceleration and braking, we used a Makey Makey to turn Rock Band pedals into triggers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Road traffic is a complex thing. We struggled with implementing a traffic system that felt real within the 24 hour time constraint. Getting the rear view mirrors to show accurate and useful information was another major challenge and milestone for us. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the fact that we were able to use the technologies that we did, and integrate them into a working project in 24 hours. \nThe way we see it, we are demonstrating the <em>practicality</em> of virtual reality as an educational tool. VR is still in its early stages. As such, it is primarily used as a (rather expensive) recreational tool. We think of VRoom as a legitimate effort to bring virtual reality into the realm of education. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>From a technical standpoint, there is a lot more going on at any given point on the streets than one would guess. We saw the extent of this complexity more clearly as we developed the simulation. The power of virtual reality as a tool for simulating real world situations comes naturally with its inherent qualities. </p>\n<h2>What's next for VRoom</h2>\n<p>In the interest of developing the correct muscle memory, the next step, first and foremost, is to switch to a steering wheel. While the pedals feel very real, an Xbox controller doesn't exactly mirror the feeling of being behind the wheel very accurately.\nOther features that are important to us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Traffic that works and makes sense. </li>\n<li>People. Pedestrians bring life to the simulation and make the consequences of our actions feel more real.</li>\n<li>A larger variety of roads. We want to cover the entire driving experience, so this is important.</li>\n<li>Complete coverage of traffic rules. </li>\n<li>Little tidbits like seatbelts and honking.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">makeymakey</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vihanchaudhry/vroom\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/vihanchaudhry/vroom\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked with Unity on the car, world-building, traffic lights, lots of general script stuff, and maintaining the code base.", "I set up the Makey Makey and I focused most of my energy towards providing a good user experience by refining features and polishing our app.", "I created the driving interactions, mirrors, blinkers, intersection logic, and general scripting.", "I setup the technologies with Unity and the Oculus Rift, worked on the driving physics and level, and made the logo."]], ["Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/929/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Phone 2</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/930/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Web 1</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/931/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Web 4</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/932/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Web 3</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/933/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Phone 1</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/934/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Web 2</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/935/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Phone 3</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/384/936/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Phone 4</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<hr/>\n<p>NOTE: If you are not in fullscreen mode, to access the button please press the menu button on the right.

With the youth, especially individuals in High School, kids can be very talkative to each other as well as students that fight. Another issue that can occur is that individuals with disabilities sometimes do not get assigned seat to meet there needs. The idea of this project was to create a simple web application where a teacher can enter in information about their students and the application will create the roster for them. I decided to go for a web design app over a software tool to allow for mass free distribution, especially to low income teacher. All an individual needs is a basic connection to the internet and a device that connects to the internet. Linked bellow is a very simple version that I was able to code up in the time I had at HackDavis.</h2>\n<h2>What it does: This application will first prompt the individual for the number of rows and columns in there room to get a seat count. Once that is completes it will ask for the number of students. New prompts will show up asking questions about the students. For this initial application we have two simple questions. Does the individual have disabilities and does an individual dislike another individual. The applications is designed to separate individuals that dislike each other and assign front row priority to handicapped individuals.</h2>\n<h2>How I built it: I started this code form scratch and focused on developing the algorithm and animations through java-script. The code is broken up into three parts. Input initially on the amount of seats in the room and the amount of students. Then it will prompt the user to input information about each student. Finally, the application will process and give out a roster. I was able to add some very basic visual graphic to make the web application look more presentable, but there is a lot of work that can be done to improve.</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into: The main challenges I ran into was approaching the javascript through the Document Object Model. This allows for a more powerful application but requires a higher level of programming. The Document Object Model focuses a lot on dynamic allocation in javascript allowing for one to scale the webpage very easily.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of: This is my first hackathon where I have developed something by myself from the scratch up. I did not have a partner so there were challenges and not having an individual to bounce ideas off of was difficult, but I also learned how to critically approach a problem.</h2>\n<h2>What I learned: I learned that there is a lot more to web application development than i though. You have to consider a lot of scenarios and make it possible for all individuals to access the webpage in a equal manner.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Automated Seat Distributor For Classrooms: If possible I would like to expand this into a full application, improving on the javascript code and creating a modern web design. I would also like to add more feature and also create a stronger algorithm adding more methods of separation.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://sunbrar.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sunbrar.github.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sunbrar.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["DormHacks", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Webapp that people sign up and they post what they can offer in the dorm life.

You're dosing off, and that's because you're trying your best to fight stage 2 sleep. We all have those times when we desperately try to stay awake. While studying at home, listening to a lecture, or even while driving. That's why we created Arouse for Muse.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Muse, for all who don't know, is a headband that reads the electrical signals generated from your brain, and sends that data via bluetooth to your device. Muse sends it to our Arouse app, and Arouse analyzes theta waves (brain waves most associated to light sleep/daydreaming) from the data. If you are dosing off, the readings from your brain drop, and it will send out a notification to wake you up.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using the MuseLib API in Android Studio, we decided to only monitor the signals coming from near the left ear, since the hippocampus responsible for sleep is closest to it.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>A small thing was that the only Android versions compatable with Muse was 5.1 and above. Only one of our phones worked, so all the coding/debugging was done on one computer.\nIt was also a challenge configuring what the Theta brainwave values that the Muse gives to the app actually meant. We couldn't find information on units in the documentation.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I had never coded JAVA or in Android Studio in my entire life.
