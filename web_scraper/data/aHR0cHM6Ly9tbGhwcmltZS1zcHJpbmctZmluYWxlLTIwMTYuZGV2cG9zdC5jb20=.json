Not leaving your desk and getting awful cramps? We know that feel -- we are the same way! But it's not healthy, and we can't sacrifice our health for our hacks. Taking smart breaks actually increases productivity and we really should hop on that train. We wanted to make it easy for you super-focused power hackers (and us) to be able to practice smart health during hackathons too, so we made Code Bud.</p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>Our hardware hack is a small desktop buddy who will inspire you to take breaks, eat, and stay hydrated through your hackathon projects. It catches a your attention when it is time to walk, or drink, or eat, and punishes those who try to avoid these tasks D:&lt;. During time between breaks, a hacker can use the Code Bud as a quick way to relieve stress through quick interactions designed not to break a hacker's focus.</p>\n<p>We also developed a demo for the online component. Stay tuned.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"our cute buddy\" data-canonical-url=\"http://amenarde.github.io/devpost_imgs/mlhprime_dev.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--AVOPZaF_--/http://amenarde.github.io/devpost_imgs/mlhprime_dev.jpg\"/></p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>Oh so much -- <em>just you wait</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>(1)</strong> At a hackathon? Your Code Bud can travel from its home base to live in a virtual hacking space (see our demo website<a href=\"http://codebud.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a> with <strong>all the other Code Buds at the hackathon</strong>, which will be a great way to create new friends and potentially trade region specific accessories and <em>stickers</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>(2)</strong> New mini-games will make the Code Bud your go-to for momentary distractions that help you clear your mind without pulling you from your work and making you lose focus. Say goodbye to Wikipedia black holes, Code Bud will be all you need.</p>\n<p><strong>(3)</strong> Every Code Bud should be an individual, just like you; customize your Hacker Buddy, its <em>looks, personality, and style</em>.</p>\n<h2>Inside the Brains of an Arduino</h2>\n<p>Our Arduino is working <strong>overtime</strong>! The steadfast Uno keeps an animation going on our OLED screen, breathing life to Code Bud using smart bitmap animations, while it displays relevant text on the RGB text LCD. It monitors three buttons for user input and a photoresistor for when people give it pats!

Whereas games today are utilizing increasingly sophisticated technology in order to provide players, both experienced and inexperienced, with a more modern look and feel to them, the chessboard has remained largely the same throughout its history. As a result, we decided to combine the traditional game of chess with a modernized interface in order to increase its appeal to a new, modern generation. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Chess++ board has the functionality of a traditional chess board, and can be used to play a traditional game of chess. However, the Chess++ board is also connected to a website which displays the current positions of the pieces on the board. Not only does the Chess++ board send information to the website, but it also takes in information from the website and displays it on the board. The Chess++ board includes LED lights below each square, and these lights can be used to display to inexperienced users the possible actions that a certain piece could perform. Once a player picks up a piece from the Chess++ board, it registers that a user has picked the piece up and displays the possible actions the piece can take. This functionality is aimed to assist new users in quickly grasping the rules of chess and to allow them to enjoy the game faster.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Chess++ board utilizes cloud technology in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino Uno in order to accomplish its functions. The board itself is built with conductive tape, which completes a circuit when a piece is placed on the grid  The grid is connected to the Arduino, which is the conduit between the website and the board itself. In addition, the Raspberry Pi is used to turn on the proper LEDs, which are situated underneath the board.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge was the lack of hardware to completely finish our design. We had to cut back on certain features that were planned, such as real-time analysis of the gameplay on the website. In addition, another challenge was figuring out the algorithm for possible moves. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the fact that we were able to develop a working prototype, and prove that this design and functionality is viable and can be further polished in the future for others to develop as well. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that communication is very important, as we had difficulty in communicating between team members and figuring out what tasks needed to be done.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Chess++</h2>\n<p>We hope to be able to implement an analysis of gameplay at the end of a game, in order to teach new players where they might have been able to make a better move. In addition, we hope to streamline the design, and make it more visually appealing. Finally, we also hope to make a realtime move analysis in addition to the analysis at the end of a game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">joint.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c-sharp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on Python script that manipulated the LEDs based on the user's actions.", "", "", ""]], ["Watch With World", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Watch With World \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/122/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>WWWorld is a Chrome extension that allows you to react to videos in real time with the world</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Watch With World \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/110/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A full screen viewing experience with reactions in real time</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Watch With World \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/114/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Exit screen viewing</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Watch With World \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/093/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Add friends to current video viewing</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Watch With World \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/092/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Search for friends to watch with</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>WWWorld's inspiration came from the possibilities of video, twilio's sync api, and the power of iconographic reactions to create an engaging and immersive user experience.

We return the exact time where the quote is being said, along with a video embedded with the timestamp loaded (if it is a YouTube video)</p>\n<p><strong>It's Command -F / Ctrl - F for videos</strong></p>\n<h2>Notable Technologies Used</h2>\n<p>We used <strong>React</strong> + <strong>React-YouTube</strong> for our frontend</p>\n<p><strong>Java</strong> + <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> for our backend</p>\n<p><strong>SASS</strong> for great design</p>\n<h2>Technical Nitty-gritty</h2>\n<p><strong>Anton Relin &amp; Joe Azar-Williams</strong> developed a back-end on Java interacting with a AWS Lambda instance. Upon receiving a query, the server will interact with the YouTube API to get a list of relevant videos within the field. Then we take the videos, parse the audio though a <em>cough</em> secret internal caption API that YouTube once had public support for but then hid <em>cough</em> .  Once we get that data, using a search library imported into the instance searches for relevance and matches using the fuzzy method. The server then gives the result through a RESTful interface. (However, the rest of the server uses Lambda for API interactions.)</p>\n<p>This is where <strong>Abhinav Suri &amp; Angelo Saraceno</strong> come in, using React, a JavaScript front-end library - we listen to a POST request from the API we have. Once that is in, we have the videos display and parse the JSON to get the desired results on the page. Any animations you see are pure SCSS - for a better UX, we decided to also place multiple timestamps.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The You-Tube API is the worst API, and we were able to get out of our comfort zone. This was Angelo's first time working with a team outside of FIU. Anton and Joe became more aquatinted with AWS Lambda. Abhinav usually doesn't tough front-end.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Relaudio</h2>\n<p>Add podcasts, bookmarks, auth, users, and show Chris Sacca if we can with the Start-Up Podcast Episode 1 as our demo example.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scss\">scss</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webpack</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">aws-lambda</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Developed algorithm for pulling captions from youtube and finding best timestamp to jump to.

But song selection shouldn't be the choice of one person. After all, the party is for everyone. We wanted to develop a way for the people to efficiently select their playlist, and allow the DJ to interact with it easily.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>deeJay implements a bidding system to request songs. The more bid points a song has, the sooner the song will play. The people are given an alotted number of points at the start of the party and can bid as many points as they want on songs of their choice throughout the party, simply by tweeting. The DJ can switch songs and control the volume with simple hand gestures. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The bidding system is implemented using Capital One's Nesse API. The points are first given and emulated by the creation of a checking account, from which you can withdraw funds when a bid is placed. In addition, if a song request is liked, bid points are awarded to the user who made the request. This is modeled by a deposit. \nWith Bose, the DJ has an elevated experience of controlling the music. Because of Bose's SoundTouch enabled speakers, we are able to interact with the speaker using hardware such as the Pebble.\nTwitter allows deeJay to be easy to use for the people. There's no app to be installed, no account to be made, all thanks to Twitter. Solely by tweeting, the people can make their bids and requests to the DJ and listen to their music of choice.\nEverything was interfaced using a Node.js server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It took a long time to program the Pebble to correctly recognize the hand gestures made by the DJ. The sheer amount of accelerometer data we were receiving was difficult to process, but after sifting through x, y, and z values, we were able to recognize gestures.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Allowing the DJ to control a speaker system with the motion of his/her hands is something we are definitely proud of, as this provides and new and easy experience for the DJ.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>By building deeJay, we learned how to use checking accounts with Capital One's Nessie API. We also learned how to use Bose's SoundTouch API to control a home or club speaker system.</p>\n<h2>What's next for deeJay</h2>\n<p>We hope to get input from real DJs and users to better the party experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/capital-one\">capital-one</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bose\">bose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bose-soundtouch\">bose-soundtouch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spotify\">spotify</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the gesture music control, along with the Capital One system.", "I worked on the Node.js server, which included using the Capital One API, the Bose SoundTouch API, the Twitter API, and the Spotify API."]], ["Mortgage-Freeman", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mortgage-Freeman \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/399/904/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mortgage-Freeman \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/248/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As millennials who don't necessarily keep a good track of our expenses, we were motivated by the possible problems that our spending habits might cause when we have to start paying for our first houses or our first cars. The average millennial tend to turn to technology for quick quotes and consultation instead of the usual bank appointments. But we soon realized the ubiquitous online mortgage calculators provided by banks and/or third parties frequently tend to overlook a user's spending patterns and overwhelm the user with financial jargons, which means that the user could be making $6k/mo and think that a thousand-dollar monthly mortgage is totally affordable, only to find out, 3 months into the contract, that it's impossible to pay the mortgage without jeopardizing the user's current lifestyle.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mortgage-Freeman is a web app that analyzes a user's account records (deposits, bills, purchases and withdrawals) and provides affordable mortgage suggestions that accommodates the user's current spending habits. The monthly payments of the recommended plans are capped at the user's expected net monthly income. Seasonal expense fluctuations are also carefully considered and factored into our calculations to give a better picture of the user's spending patterns.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Capital One's API to generate client accounts, including bills, payrolls, withdrawals, etc. For each individual account, the payroll direct deposits, bills, and spendings are netted and adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, to obtain a net amount of income available for each month. That number is then used as an upper limit to cap the monthly payments of possible mortgage suggestions. An expansive list of interest rates and loan periods as well as fixed-rate plans and negotiable plans are then used to derive a mortgage plan for which the monthly payment is the largest possible value that is less than the maximum amount possible. The algorithms also accounted for the unique expenses related to different purchases, such as property taxes and car insurance. All the reference data was taken from top North American retail banks and the U.S. Treasury Board, amongst other sources.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>With the internet down for a good few hours, we were unable to test out the API connections. We were also highly limited by the time and resources available. We had to pivot multiple times during the algorithm design process in order to bypass cases too complicated for a 24-hr hack.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the amount of research involved with this project. Given the time and data constraints, we did our very best to simulate real-life financing situations. We weren't discouraged by the internet problems and were able to design and implement the majority of our frontend and algorithms without internet connection. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot of decision factors involved with choosing a mortgage plan in real life. We also gained in-depth knowledge of the key differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3.5, something which we did not seriously consider until we started the arduous debugging process.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mortgage-Freeman</h2>\n<p>If we have more time, we'd love to work with larger data sets, refine our algorithms for financial calculations, and use neural networks to better identify user spending patterns. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/quandl\">quandl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scipy\">scipy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/domain\">domain</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/timotius02/mortgage-freeman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/timotius02/mortgage-freeman\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the web app's user interface along with connecting the front-end to our back-end's algorithm.", "I worked on gathering data such as customer income, purchases, bills, withdrawals, etc. using the Capital One Api.

It started as a simple way to use QR codes on dog tags to get alerted when someone finds your lost dog, it turned into much more.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There's two goals of PetControl, the first is the original idea of using a QR code to keep track of pets. Current dog tags can hold small amounts of information, maybe a name and an address.  By using PetControl's QR tags pet owners can set large amounts of information.  The owner can tell the person who finds it the dogs name, the owners name, the phone number, address, and special notes about the pet.  By doing this it allows the pet to get home to the owner faster and safer.</p>\n<p>The second part of PetControl came after, instead of only being able to be used when a pet is lost, PetControl can be used any time of the day to help manage and take care of your beloved animal friend.  With widgets in a dashboard on our website, pet owners can log in and view a live video of their pet with their Nest Camera, order more food for their pet using the eBay API, or mark their dog as lost so they are immediately notified whenever someone scans their dog's tag.</p>\n<p>Not everyone has a QR code reader, or a smartphone, that's why we used <strong>Twilio</strong> to send a picture of the tag to a number and it act the same as the app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The back end was all developed using Python, combined with Flask we were able to create a fully functioning website complete with accounts, pets, dashboard, and numerous other features (including Twilio support).

Moreover, by combining multiple sensory stimuli, namely touch, sight, and sound, this mobile application works in order to reinforce the individual's speech choices helping with learning as well. \nThe second element of this project is a web application that allows an individual's caregiver, such as teachers or parents, to track the individual's progress with communication using the mobile app and will provide analytic data about the connections that are being made through the mobile app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The web application portion of the hack is intended to be a analytics tool for the care-givers.

Due to this, our hack had to assume the intended result and we prototyped the software around the features provided by Tanvas. </p>\n<p>Another challenge was the use of new frameworks such as Angular 2 which is currently still in Release Candidate (so not a fully stable and DOCUMENTED version at the moment...). We also found that navigating and coding a new language was a challenge - for example, coming into the hack, our mobile app developers had no experience in Swift or XCode and learning on the job was a very interesting and tough situation.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of how we worked together as a team to build this amazing project. Our team consists of 6 people which included 2 psychology majors that provided better insight into what was needed for the project. This made the environment of the hack very interesting and diverse and opened up discussions about how we can make the biggest impact. We also are very proud of what we have hacked because we feel like it can greatly improve the way an individual can communicate with the world and how we can understand that.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned many new cutting-edge technology during this hack, such as Angular 2, Swift and mobile development. We also learned how to make a larger project with multiple elements working together such as the communication app in iOS, the analytics tracking in the web app, and the industry insight from our other members to make a complete application.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Speaking Sensibly</h2>\n<p>Speaking Sensibly aims to build a suite of apps to help facilitate speech learning, fine motor skills, and desensitization of textures.

We did not have enough time to implement some of the many ideas we came up with, but chose the best of the few. We decided we wanted to see more games featuring this technology which lead us to creating Haptic Labyrinth. Some of the ideas that we were not able to include in this submission are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>An application which contains several musical instruments such as a guitar, where the strings would provide a haptic sensation.</li>\n<li>Haptic passwords/login where certain areas with the haptics to be touched in order to unlock the device.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Haptic Labyrinth is a creatively innovative way to experience Tanvas. Haptic Labyrithn is an dark maze of sorts with objectives that must be completed in order to advance to the next level of the labyrinth. The player will begin at the entrance to the labyrinth and without any visual aids, and must navigate through the maze only using sense of touch. The haptic walls generate a rough sensation which will be very noticeable to the player. As the player navigates throughout the maze, they must find a key to unlock the objective gate which blocks the exit to the next labyrinth. In case the player misses the key, and runs into the haptic gate first, there is a special haptic feel unique to gates. Keys will become visual when they are within a small range of the player. To provide some sense of direction to the player, we included a temporary path and visual steps where the player previously moved. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Most of the time was spent coming up with ideas to devote our time to creating the application.

Accessing information quickly should happen instantly in a smart home environment and we believe that our project, Navi, is a step towards that future.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Navi is an ambient user experience platform for the smart home built on top of three core technologies, the Nest Camera, the Amazon Echo and the Navi Web App. </p>\n<p>Navi uses the Nest Camera and extends its motion detection capabilities with Microsoft's Facial Recognition API allowing it to recognize users from its constant video feed. </p>\n<p>Once a user is recognized coming into the house, this allows the user's next interactions with the Navi Alexa Skill to be personalized towards them, allowing them to obtain information and perform actions that are personalized to them.</p>\n<p>Interacting with the Navi Alexa App also updates the user's session in real time, connecting directly with their associated Navi Account and populating the Navi web app with any requests that they are currently making to provide extended information on their computer as well as their phones.</p>\n<p>With this quick recognition system, users will have to set up just once and never have to bother going through clunky user interfaces to access their personal information again. Best of all, because of the facial comparison we implemented from Project Oxford, multiple users will be able to have their own dynamic experience on a single set of devices.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team used the Nest Cam to detect motion and send back images which we then sent to Microsoft's Cognitive Services to be processed by their Facial Recognition API.

In the end, the fire alarm profile was made more robust to false positives while the voices were left sensitive because the failure to identify causes massive sound quality degradation due to lost frames.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We created a system that allows you to select sounds and in many cases, even voices of people which you want to hear, and pass them through to you, allowing you to hear them crystal clearly, even with headphones, so you never miss an important moment.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that with some machine learning analysis, it's possible to identify both noises and some voices with fairly high accuracy, if the sounds are normalized and calibrated against noise. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Selective Hearing</h2>\n<p>Improve the voice modeling and allow for smaller datasets to make it possible to construct voice profiles faster. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">skikit-nn</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pyaudio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gulp-js\">gulp.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["stat.us", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Having no access to the internet for a considerable duration of the hackathon inspired us to explore a means of receiving information on the web via SMS.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Stat.us incorporates Twilio's cloud communication capabilities through SMS messaging and gathers data about current worldwide trending topics or any custom search on Twitter's public platform, delivering top tweets to the user in real time, without the need for the user to be connected to the internet. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We registered a phone number on Twilio that the user is able to text to receive information about a trending topic.

PoGoRobo is a trainer's best companion. It loyally follows its trainer, carries items, and represents the trainer's team using LED lights, all while allowing the trainer to focus on catching Pok\u00e9mon. PoGoRobo was built wiith the help of Arduino, duck tape, cardboard, a small robot base, and the drive to be the very best like no one ever was. Our main challenges were training PoGoRobo to recognize its trainer with the Pixy camera and optimizing power usage. Despite these obstacles, PoGoRobo can autonomously follows its trainer and represent their Pok\u00e9mon GO team. We learned how to use Arduino to control the robot and to detect the color of the trainer's shirt.  As a result, we were able to get the PoGoRobo to follow us and accompany us on our journey.  Our next step for the PoGoRobo will be to mass produce a more polished version so that trainers all around the world can become the very best like no one ever was. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electronics</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pixy-camera</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["normaleyes", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"normaleyes \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/399/966/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"normaleyes \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/399/968/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Live-time transcript analysis</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"normaleyes \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/191/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Personality analysis</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"normaleyes \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/192/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Candidate information</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Companies are constantly trying to improve the hiring process so that they can identify the employees that will be the most productive in their company. Oftentimes, it's difficult to differentiate between implicit biases and a candidate's performance. For example, a woman and man who are both outspoken about their opinions could be perceived in different ways; the woman could be considered rude or bossy, whereas the man could be seen as confident and idea-oriented. We want companies to be able to look at what happens during an interview objectively. </p>\n<p>Within a company, the hiring process from start to finish takes many months. With the increasing number of applicants and the information that comes with it, the hiring process can get very tedious and lengthy. We wanted to make the entire hiring process more streamlined and data-driven. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>With normaleyes, the guesswork and biases of interviews are removed, and information is displayed in a user-friendly, holistic evaluation. First, we record each interview and transcribe the audio using IBM Watson's Speech to Text. Next, we perform sentiment, emotion, and tone analysis on the conversation to identify the prevalence of the Big Five personality traits in a candidate: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. We also look at the candidate's sentiment towards their previous teams, and the emotional composition of each section of their interview.</p>\n<p>Not only do we display the information we've synthesized on easy-to-read graphs, but we also support a live-time breakdown of the interview. Furthermore, we provide tools to facilitate other aspects of the hiring process, such as accepting a candidate and fulfilling travel reimbursements.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use a Nest Camera to record the audio and video components of interviews. We then use Bluemix APIs to analyze the interviews for sentiments, emotions, tones, and personality traits. Finally, the information is uploaded to AWS S3, where a React application allows users to visualize and understand the data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our app is simple to use and easily integrates into any company. Moreover, it is scalable and has applications beyond corporate interviews. Not only can it provide feedback on a candidate from an interview, but it can also analyze any form of human conversation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul

We have two components to our hack, one is an LED display light up that will display letters of the alphabet in braille, and another is a servo prototype. We hope that people can use this hack as an alternative to make a simple affordable refreshable braille screen for their children. We have also made out of copyright classic works found at  found at Project Gutenberg available for reading without having to custom order a braille print version of the books, and Alexa will read out from the book as one reads along with the braille screen.</p>\n<p><b>Challenges</b>:</p>\n<p>Firstly, we were limited by hardware. We only managed to borrow three servos, while a single braille character requires 6 dots. For the first prototype, we therefore moved to using a set of 6 LEDs to indicate movable components, and represent a single braille character at a time as arudino parses the text.</p>\n<p>For the next prototype, we tried using getting the 3 servos that we did have to work, and to represent a proof of concept for the braille system. However, we found that servos consume a lot of power, power that the arduino was not able to supply. We tried working around this by using two arduinos to power our prototype, but found out that we really do need to use batteries to power 3 servos. Unfortunately, the hardware station was out of batteries, so we settled for using just demoing 1 servo.</p>\n<p>We create a chassis for our 3 servos using the 3D printer, however, we forgot that the real world is not perfect, and we forgot to put in enough allowances for our cover, and so as a workaround, we used a soldering iron to make some holes bigger.</p>\n<p>We had problems with downloading the Project Gutenberg python library, and google was scarce on the knowledge of the problem, so we had to make a custom Gutenberg scrapping python program that uses beautiful-soup. Another problem we had was that Project Gutenberg is fussy with automatic downloaders of their books, so if we sent them too many requests in too short a time span, they put a CAPTCHA black list on us.</p>\n<p><b>What's next:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hopefully you'll get to see Alexa integration at the hackathon</li>\n<li>Implementation of grade 2 braille for reading books</li>\n<li>A fully functional servo braille screen with at least 6 servos</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">arduino-101</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">servos</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">leds</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">project-gutenberg</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tinkercad\">tinkercad</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dremel-3d</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/alexa\">alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/beautiful-soup\">beautiful-soup</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/audreyong/mlhPrimeSpringFinale2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/audreyong/mlhPrimeSpringFinale2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lwolfsonkin/BrailleBlink\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lwolfsonkin/BrailleBlink\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Assisted w/ Python-Arduino transfer, researched for backend", "", "", ""]], ["TimeLine", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TimeLine \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/400/272/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>OverView</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>After seeing the same bulky and  uninviting table block view layout I thought re-displaying the information in a better format is smarter!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Takes any website that has a table view layout and makes into into a Time Line layout.\n(Also helps with bringing underlying Meta Data of Icons so that you can search for the one you want faster)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using HTML and CSS for styling and custom shapes\nUsing JavaScript for Animations</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The Dev Tools on Google Chrome told me I didn't close a  tag when really i forgot a &amp;quot;)&amp;quot; for a JavaScript function above it....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=\"accomplishments-that-i&amp;#39;m-proud-of\"&gt;Accomplishments that I&amp;#39;m proud of&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I managed to build this hack with barely any Wi-Fi and I learned a lot more about JS Animations :D. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=\"what-i-learned\"&gt;What I learned&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned how to create JavaScript Animations\nI learned the basics of Ubuntu&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2 id=\"what&amp;#39;s-next-for-timeline\"&gt;What&amp;#39;s next for TimeLine&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Integrating a Custom PHP Parser and HTML injection using JavaScript to make the whole process seamless&lt;/p&gt;\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Game of Hounds", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Watched a video with people playing One Night Ultimate Werewolf and did not want to spend 20 bucks on the cards.

We chose Twitter to analyze this information because we believe want a person chooses to say when they're under a constraint holds more weight and is more revealing of a person's true character. </p>\n<p>As Mark Twain once put it _ \u201cI didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.\u201d _</p>\n<h2>The Tech</h2>\n<p><strong>Back End</strong>\nWe used <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>express</strong> in the back end (Mark and Kerlin) for the server and as a means of communication between <strong>R</strong> files written by Krista and the server. Various node modules were implemented alongside our R code in order to compliment each other. We used the <strong>twitter API</strong> in order to get all of a user's tweets and info. </p>\n<p><strong>Data Data Data</strong>\nWe did the majority of the data analysis in <strong>R</strong> we had to use <strong>natural language processing</strong> and parse through lots of tweets to get the information we needed to extract relevant data. We used this data to build WorldCloud graphs, determine the most important interactions between other users, etc. We supplemented the R data analysis with some classifications done using Node.js to determine attributes of the profile, pull sentiment data, analysis of passive vs. active voice, and determine professionalism. </p>\n<h2>Front End and Design</h2>\n<p>We used <strong>semantic UI</strong> for the front end frame work, <strong>jQuery</strong> for front end manipulation, <strong>moment.js</strong> for time manipulation. Google Fonts for pretty text. </p>\n<p>For the Designs we used <strong>PhotoShop</strong> and <strong>Illustrator.</strong> </p>\n<h2>How does it work</h2>\n<p>The user Enters a twitter screen name they want to have analyzed into our web-application. This name is sent to our server so we can pull the information from their twitter. This information can be pulled as long as you are following them on twitter or they are public. Our server pulls the information, analyzes the data, and returns valuable  insights  and graphics to the user.</p>\n<h2>Learning</h2>\n<p><strong>Mark</strong>\nThis is the first time Mark ever did back end. Normally in hackathons he handles front end work. He learned how to use API's, how to use OAuth,  and how to communicate with other languages(specifically R) using child processes in Node.js. </p>\n<p><strong>Caleb</strong>\nHe learned how charting libraries work in javascript, even though we later decided not to implement these features in out application. He learned how to use semantic UI for front end frame works. He normally does not use frameworks when doing web design.  </p>\n<p><strong>Roshi</strong>\nGot to work with new features in illustrator called the \"shaper tool.\" </p>\n<p><strong>Krista</strong>\nKrista learned a lot about natural language processing. She learned how to parse through large amounts of data and format it an easily accessible way. She also learned what Perl was, and was able to use it to assist in parsing text and the natural language processing. This is what allowed us to make the WordClouds. She gained deeper understanding of making Graphs in R, and how to write them to a file in the command line. Krista also gained more experience with R packages like, tm, worldcloud, jsonlite, and ggplot2.  This was the first hackathon that she was successfully able to interpret json files into R. </p>\n<p><strong>Kerlin</strong>\nKerlin also learned natural language processing. Got experience running R in Node.js and exposure to R. He also learned beginning data analysis and data manipulation. He also learned how to use a basic machine learning technique called classification.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/calebdre/culture-fit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/calebdre/culture-fit\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://culturefitt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://culturefitt.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>culturefitt.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend.

Throughout our education, however, we couldn't help but notice the incredibly low percentage of women pursuing jobs in information or network security. In software development, women make up roughly 30% of coders. In cybersecurity, women make up only 10%</p>\n<p>For a long time, there have existed tools that teach young computer novices simple programming concepts like loops and conditionals through fun games and activities. These tools have been especially helpful in encouraging women to pursue jobs in computer science and software development. However, there is no equivalent tool for basic, essential cybersecurity concepts: cryptography, packet analysis, social engineering, etc. We wondered why we couldn't create such a program.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Adventures of Hackergirl follows a female hacker on her first day in a law enforcement career. Her supervisor, Officer Maria, gives her an assignment to track Ms. Evilady, a notorious criminal suspected of kidnapping puppies. Currently, the game teaches three lessons.</p>\n<p>The first lesson is the difference between ethical and unethical hacking. Hackergirl has to get a warrant before collecting any information on Ms. Evilady. To do this, she must demonstrate a reasonable suspicion that Ms. Evilady is actually kidnapping puppies. We felt that this lesson - follow the law, and use your skills only for good - is an important lesson to learn for any hacker, young or old.</p>\n<p>The second lesson teaches kids about packets. The packets are depicted as envelopes, each going to and coming from a certain address. The game instructs children to only collect certain packets going to certain addresses. Hackergirl only has a warrant on Ms. Evilady, not everyone else who wants to send messages. The letter analogy helps kids to understand packets (envelopes with letters inside), IP addresses (addresses), and packet captures. </p>\n<p>The third lesson teaches kids about encryption. We designed a fake encryption algorithm, ShapeCrypt, that transforms the message inside a particular packet into a series of shapes. However, some packets also contain keys. The kids have to figure out which packets contain keys, which packets contain messages, and which keys match with which messages. This lessons helps kids to understand what it means to encrypt and decrypt a message, and why encryption may be used.</p>\n<p>At the end of the story, the puppies are rescued and Hackergirl has saved the day.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Unity and C# to create the game. We used open source clip art for the animations. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The internet was somewhat spotty throughout the hackathon, which meant we got started on our project late and felt a bit discouraged. This was also our first time a) building a game and b) using Unity to create 2-D animations, so we ran into somewhat of a learning curve. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We both loved this idea from the start, and we wanted to give it the time and hard work it deserved. Despite the technical and logistical setbacks, we felt we lived up to that goal. Hackergirl is at a great start, and we're excited to see what she's in for next!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a ton about Unity, animations, and game design in general. </p>\n<h2>What's next for HackerGirl</h2>\n<p>James and Casey are both mentors for Georgetown Women who Code, an organization dedicated to teaching women how to code and mentoring female computer science enthusiasts. We thought it would be a fantastic experience all around to offer our mentees a chance to participate in this project. The students could work together in small groups, each developing an additional level to our game that can teach new cybersecurity concepts. Eventually, we hope to release the game publicly for girls all over the world to enjoy. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Muse Runner", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to build a real time multiplayer game that's fun to play and required you to actually move around.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We created a multiplayer game where players can race against each other to complete the maze the fastest.

Using Twilio to relay the message to itself, we were able to get the message available to extract data from.

They're playing hand-held, mobile, desktop, and many other video games. Users will often pick up a game they find interesting, but rarely will they interact with the game as much as they would with a Virtual Reality game. We made Project-Sluggers to provide people an opportunity to play a game with a unique and unforgettable experience. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We provide a full system to provide a full-out baseball game experience. The first part of our system is using multiple Oculus DK2's to provide a view in the prespective of a Batter, Pitcher, and Umpire. The Umpire first provides a number (detected from leap motion) to the Pitcher: #1 is to throw a normal throw and #2 is to throw a fastball. Then the Pitcher throws a baseball after throw gesture is detected from the Leap Motion attached to the DK2. Lastly the Batter's view recognizes that a ball was thrown; thus, making the Batter react to the thrown and swing (a bat with a Myo attached) according to where the ball is. </p>\n<p>The second portion is handling all the data and syncing the views together. We sync the views together through a Firebase DLL and a C# update function. After the ball is hit, we use Express and Twilio Sync to manage the bat rotation, throw type (normal or fastball), and a calculation of the highest score.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The game has two parts: the virtual reality game and a server to handle data. The game leverages multiple C# libraries and Unity applied physics to allow for where the ball goes and where the bat located in the 3D space. Once the entire cycle of a single hit is complete, the information is transferred via a Post Request to the server with the location of the bat, highscore, and type of throw. We iterate a sync using Twilio Sync before we tweet all the information to Twitter. The tweet gives you a readable-length summary of the useful information collected during the baseball game. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Using sync was something we had to get creative with. Since they do not support Native Unity yet, we found a work around and told Unity to post to the server and let the JS server handle Twilio Sync. Another Challenge was setting up our windows computer to become compatible with the entire project (aka installing java, unity, Visual Studio, and a couple of other things). The last thing was spotty internet. However it all came together at the end and we came to present our great product. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were excited when we knew that we had a cohesive entire system, from the video game to a live Twilio Sync'd Twitter Bot. We were also proud of creating something we will actually use and provide entertainment to others (we gave ourself entertainment, and hopefully others' too).</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Some of our team learned how to program Leap Motion. While others learned how to set up an environment for a completely new instance of Windows. We also learned that this entire project was really fun and we work great together.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project-Sluggers</h2>\n<p>We want to implement an Amazon button to the unity game that will allow us to customize our bat or character or even outfit!

The current solution has advantage over traditional techniques by using white spaces present between the WIFI channels in 2.4 and 5 GHz bands to identify the presence of the users. Since in most cases the demand for Wireless connectivity over WIFI is directly proportional to number of users in the given environment, (not to forget even though  a user might be using smart phone at all time, but the device is constantly using WLAN to sync email and other notifications from various websites and service). Thus the presence of users gives a close estimate of the demand along with certain other parameters such as time of the day, average data consumption and demand by users.) </p>\n<p>The solution can also be used by home users to actively track the user across the home. This allows to adapt the WLAN resources allocations to enhance performance, as well as to actuate devices such localized speakers to play music from a central system ( or stream from Services such as Pandora or Saavn or Spotify).</p>\n<p>Check out the complete details from the github folder.</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/suryatp/MLHPrime_ZTE_comp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/suryatp/MLHPrime_ZTE_comp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["marc", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There are a number of easily observable trends, based on time of the year, in the US Stock Market.  These include things like chocolate companies' stock going up before Halloween and Valentine's day and Hasbro, the toy company, tending to reach its yearly peak right around December 24th.  But what other, less suspected, trends exist in the market? Marc is here to help you find out. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Marc is an interactive SMS bot.  Ask marc questions about stock trends and it will do its best to answer you.  Marc is currently implemented in detection of trends in the Dow Jones over the last 10 years.  It can give accurate data about market history for this stock on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Marc uses Twilio API to connect to users through SMS.  Massive CSV files were parsed using python and algorithms were run on the resulting data in Java, to search for trends based on date.  Marc has a beautifully designed web platform to go along with its SMS functionality. </p>\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\n<p>Marc has the potential to store data on and deploy predictive analytics on any stock.  We felt that Dow Jones would be reliable and more stable than smaller stocks for our proof of concept.  In the future, marc could also be built on more machine learning platforms to cross long time periods of stock data with other types of information like agricultural exports, national debt, and sea levels.  We wanted to implement comparison algorithms between Dow Jones prices and statistics from Data.gov but ran out of time.

We felt the need to create a service which aggregated these events and the attendees sentiments to create a comprehensive event schedule.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Flock uses the Twitter API to find trending events in a given city or metro area. When the user selects a city, our service retrieves trending hashtags in that area from Twitter. Using the tweets within these hashtags, our backend application aggregates the vibe of events in a given area and creates a comprehensive list. Using this technology, the users would be able to find things to do and make plans suited to their interests.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed this concept using Photoshop and OneNote. First, we developed our idea using 'user stories' and 'wireframes' in Microsoft OneNote. This allowed us to come up with an ultimate user experience for our target demographic (young, tech savvy city-goers).</p>\n<p>Using this work, we moved on to Photoshop to further develop our concept. Here, we developed a clean and modern user interface. Using gradients, light shadows, and the material design concept, our team developed a simple and intuitive design to view tweets and to find cool events.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>From the very start our project, the Internet connection at the hackathon did not work. Therefore, it was nearly impossible to work or collaborate. Documentation of APIs and frameworks were totally unavailable, and so development was therefore halted for many hours. Additionally, our package managers, bundling software, and version control software was unable to connect to the necessary servers. Despite these roadblocks, we spent our time at MLH Prime developing our concept and developing our user interface.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we were able to produce a plan and user interface for our concept despite major challenges along the way. Without Internet access, we were able to develop our idea as far as we could using the resources available to us.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>One of the most significant lessons we learned was that the Internet is taken for granted--especially in the development process. Additionally, we learned to pivot when resources are limited. This lesson was also very essential because it gave us experience in dealing with major roadblocks during a project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Flock</h2>\n<p>We plan on developing Flock further. The concept is exciting to us and is something that we would use in our daily lives. We hope that Flock can grow into a service to help people answer a common question: what are we doing tonight?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/onenote\">onenote</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Code", "Concept Development", "Graphic design", ""]], ["Exposed", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Exposed \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/399/997/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>As teenagers, we're always messaging our friends on social media, such as Facebook.

As many as 75 percent of patients (and 50 percent of chronically ill patients) fail to adhere to, or comply with physician prescribed treatment regimens.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>EzPill allows for the automation of of medicine management. When users get a new prescription, they open up our mobile app and enter prescription info such as dosage times and amounts. Then when it comes time for the user to take their prescription, EzPill automatically dispenses the correct dosage and notifies the user through text and the speaker connected to EzPill. When prescriptions are running row, users are notified to get ready to refill their prescription. Users and caregivers can also take advantage of the web app to view current medications and their respective counts, which are updated live.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>EzPill is run off a Raspberry Pi, which controls two servos which are responsible for dispensing the pills. When the android app is used to enter a new prescription, Twilio's Sync client is used to update all devices connected to the EzPill (Web app, Android app, and EzPill). When it comes time to dispense a dosage, the servos spin up and dispense a pill from the respective drum and the pill count is updated. Twilio's text message API is used to notify the user about the dosage being dispensed. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We originally struggled with figuring out which IoT platform to base everything on. We tried out two systems, but due to the amount of security/authentication required to use the service, we decided to try out Twilio's new Sync platform. Another problem we faced was that we were unable to 3D print our enclosure, which led to us having to make it out of cardboard. Finally, we continue to face the problem of dispensing a single pill 100% of the time. Only having cardboard to make the pill discs out of, they were not cut accurately enough to not have the chance of two pills being caught in the opening. This can easily be solved by laser cutting discs with the exact dimensions that we need.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of getting a mix of hardware and software so communicate and stay in sync with each other. We are also proud of having a functioning prototype made out of the minimal resources we had to build the pill dispenser.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Twilio's Sync API to communicate between different systems running different languages. We also learned how make real time web pages using SignalR. Finally, we learned how to control continuous servos and manage their spin speed and time. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">signalr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iis</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">snowboy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/zn22ubt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tinyurl.com/zn22ubt\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tinyurl.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Configured servo control and raspberry pi to work with Twilio Sync and synchronize data.
