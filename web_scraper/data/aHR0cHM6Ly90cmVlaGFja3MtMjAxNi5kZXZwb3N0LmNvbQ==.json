Pantri provides a visually compelling picture of which foods you should eat based on your current nutritional needs and offers recipe suggestions through Amazon Alexa voice integration.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Pantri uses FitBit data to determine which nutritional goals you have or haven't met for the day, then transforms your kitchen with Intel Edison-connected RGB LCD screens and LIFX lighting to lead you in the direction of healthy options as well as offer up recipe suggestions to balance out your diet and clean out your fridge.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The finished hack is a prototype food storage unit (pantry) made of cardboard, duct tape, and plexiglass.  It is connected to the backend through button and touch sensors as well as LIFX lights and RGB LCD screens.  Pressing the button allows you to view the nutritional distribution without opening the door, and opening the door activates the touch sensor.  The lights and screens indicate which foods (sorted onto shelves based on nutritional groups) are the best choices.  Users can also verbally request a dinner suggestion which will be offered based on which nutritional categories are most needed.\nAt the center of the project is a Ruby on Rails server hosted live on Heroku.  It stores user nutrition data, provides a mobile web interface, processes input from the button and touch sensors, and controls the LIFX lights as well as the color and text of the RGB LCD screens.\nAdditionally, we set up three Intel Edison microprocessors running Cylon.js (built on top of Node.js) with API interfaces so information about their attached button, touch sensor, and RGB LCD screens can be connected to the Rails server.<br/>\nFinally, an Amazon Alexa (connected through an Amazon Echo) connects users with the best recipes based on their nutritional needs through a voice interface.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">grove</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lifx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Slip", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Slip \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/432/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Most students know the feeling of being behind in classes, and Stanford really tries to help us out. We get both lecture slides and videos for many classes, but neither alone is sufficient. Lecture slides are useful for quick information look up, but are often too dense to interpret without explanation. On the other hand, videos fill in these holes in understanding, but are riddled with superfluous information that can take hours to parse through. What if we could combine these two resources to create a fully integrated visual and auditory learning experience?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Slip establishes a two-way mapping between class videos and slides to allow for a seamless transition between the two. Watch a few slides until the material gets too dense and then click the slide to instantly move to the exact point in the video where that same concept is being explained. By fully integrating classroom resources, Slip allows students to navigate between class notes, slides, and videos with a single click. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We collected our source data by extracting all the slides from lecture notes with ImageMagick and key frames from the class video using ffmpeg. After extraction, we use SIFT to identify the slide, if present, in every frame, and OCR (optical character recognition) to see how closely the text in each slide/frame match up. By combining these two metrics, we can compute optimal slide and frame mappings for the entire lecture with 90-95% confidence.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Accuracy is extremely important, but often videos don\u2019t have great captures of the slides. Neither image processing nor OCR alone were enough to reach an accuracy we liked, but they compliment each other very well. OCR is very good for text-heavy slides and image processing is very effective on others. Even using both together, the algorithm still found incorrect mappings much of the time. The big trick for great accuracy was using the knowledge that we have the slides in order. This allows us to not simply look for the best frame for each slide, but the best set of frames for all the slides at once, such that the slides are in order. Optimizing this in a reasonable amount of time required a clever dynamic programming solution, but greatly increased accuracy.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Definitely accuracy. We came in with very little knowledge of image processing and ended up getting some really good accuracy. We also built a seamless front end that makes it super simple for the user to switch between video and lecture, maximizing productivity.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>If it can go wrong, it will go wrong. We definitely had issues along the way from libraries with bad documentation, to hard to fun bugs, to being completely unsure of how to proceed, but together we powered through.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Slip</h2>\n<p>Improve speed of algorithm for image processing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tesseract\">tesseract</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ffmpeg\">ffmpeg</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/imagemagick\">imagemagick</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rchen8/unslide\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rchen8/unslide\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Backend - created the algorithm that determines which frames match up to which slides", "frontend, server-side, created API endpoint", "backend, pre-processing pipeline, testing opencv feature detection and ocr", "OCR, image preprocessing, feature detection"]], ["Gait", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gait \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/114/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Are you walking correctly?</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gait \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/125/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logging screen.

With the astonishing computational power we have today, we could use predictive analysis to suggest the patients' potential illness.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Clow takes a picture of the patient's face during registration and run it through an emotion analysis algorithm. With the \"scores\" that suggest the magnitude of a certain emotional trait, Clow matches these data with the final diagnosis result given by the doctor to predict illnesses.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We integrated machine learning and emotion analysis algorithms from Microsoft Azure cloud services on our Ionic-based app to predict the trends. We \"trained\" our machine by pairing the \"scores\" of images of sick patients with its illness, allowing it to predict illnesses based on the \"scores\".</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>All of us are new to machine learning and this has proved to be a challenge to all of us. Fortunately, Microsoft's representative was really helpful and guided us through the process. We also had a hard time writing the code to upload the image taken from the camera to a cloud server in order to run it through Microsoft's emotion analysis API, since we have to encode the image before uploading it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning a new skill over a weekend and deploy it on a working prototype ain't easy. We did that, not one but two skills, over a weekend. And it's machine learning and emotion analysis.

Well, at least we can visualize it now, and we are excited to work with machine learning and unleash its potential in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Clow</h2>\n<p>Clow needs the support of medical clinics and hospitals in order to be deployed. As the correlation between emotion and illness is still relatively unproven, research studies have to be done in order to prove its effectiveness. It may not be effectively produce results in the beginning, but if Clow analyzes thousands of patients' emotion and illness, it can actually very accurately yield these results.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chriswongtv/clow-clinic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chriswongtv/clow-clinic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on integrating machine learning and emotion analysis into the app.", "Helped with the front-end with Dominick and design", "I worked on the front-end for the patient and clinical side app. Design, UI and loose ends here and there."]], ["Alexa M.D.", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mU8zpgKXsnM?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Alexa M.D. \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/071/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Alexa M.D. \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/085/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Alexa M.D. \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/088/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Alexa M.D. \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/127/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Every year, our school does a Grand Challenges Research project where they focus on important topic in the world. This year, the focus is on mental health which providing cost-effective treatment and make it accessible to everyone. We all may know someone who has a phobia, came back from a tour in the military, or is living with another mental illness, 1 in 5 Americans to be exact. As the increase of mental health awareness rises, the availability of appointments with counselors and treatments lessens. Additionally, we this could be used to provide at home inquires for people who are hesitant to get help. With Alexa M.D. we hope to use IoT (internet of things) to bring the necessary treatment to the patient for better access, cost, and also to reduce the stigma of mental illness. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user can receive information and various treatment options through Alexa M.D. First, the user speaks to Alexa through the Amazon echo, the central interface, and they can either inquire about various medical information or pick at-home treatment options. Through web-scraping of Web M.D. and other sites, Alexa M.D. provides information simply by asking. Next, Alexa M.D. will prompt the user with various treatment options which are a version of exposure therapy for many of the symptoms. The user will engage in virtual reality treatment by re-enacting various situations that may usually cause them anxiety or distress, but instead in a controlled environment through the Oculus Rift. Treatments will incrementally lessen the user's anxieties; they can use the Leap Motion to engage in another dimension of treatment when they are ready to move to the next step. This virtualizes an interaction with many of the stimuli that they are trying to overcome. When the treatment session has concluded, Alexa M.D. will dispense the user's prescribed medication through the automated medicine dispenser, powered by the Intel Edison. This ensures users take appropriate dosages while also encouraging them to go through their treatment session before taking their medication. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Alexa skills sets to teach the Amazon Echo to recognize new commands. This enables communication to both the Oculus and our automated medicine dispenser through our backend on Firebase. We generated various virtual environments through Unity; the Leap Motion is connected to the Oculus which enables the user to interact with their virtual environment. When prompted by a medical questions, Alexa M.D. uses web-scraping from various medical websites, including Web M.D., to produce accurate responses. To make the automated medicine dispenser, we 3D printed the dispensing mechanism, and laser cut acrylic to provide the structural support. The dispenser is controlled by a servo motor via the Intel Edison and controls output of the medication as prescribed by Alexa M.D. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We found it difficult to sync the various components together (Oculus, Intel Edison, Amazon Alexa), and communicating between all 3 pieces. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The Internet of Things is the frontier of technology, and we are proud of  integrating the 3 very distinct components together. Additionally, the pill dispenser was sketched and created all within the span of the hackathon, and we were able to utilize various new methods such as laser cutting. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Through the weekend, we learned a great deal about working with Amazon web service, as well as Amazon Alexa and how to integrate these technologies. Additionally, we learned about using modeling software for both 3D printing and laser printing. Furthermore, we learned how to set up the Arduino shield for the Intel Edison and integrating the leap motion with the Oculus Rift. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Alexa M.D.</h2>\n<p>We hope that this can become available for all households, and that it can reduce the cost necessary for treatments, as well as improve access to such treatments. Costs for regular treatment include transportation, doctors and nurses, pharmacy visits, and more. It can be a first step for people are are hesitant to consult a specialist, or a main component of long-term treatment. Some mental illnesses, such as PTSD, even prevent patients from being able to interact with the outside world, which present difficulties when going to seek treatment. Additionally, we hope that this can reduce the stigma of treatment of mental illnesses by integrating such treatments easily into the daily lives of users. Patients can continue their treatments in the privacy of their own home where they won't feel any pressures.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lasercutting</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://ruthie-johnson-kzcx.squarespace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ruthie-johnson-kzcx.squarespace.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ruthie-johnson-kzcx.squarespace.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AkhilNadendla/Tree-Hacks-Jarvis-MD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AkhilNadendla/Tree-Hacks-Jarvis-MD\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote backend server code using AWS lambda, Node.js, and Firebase.

really enjoy Virtual Reality and wanted to work with the Oculus DK2. Combining this with our love for music, we thought it would be interesting and fun to find a way to visualize music in a three - dimensional context.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>HearVR is a program that combines Machine Learning with Virtual Reality to create an environment where SoundCloud music files can be played and visualized through a frequency spectrum and user - created comments. Music files and corresponding comments are gathered from SoundCloud and a sentiment analysis is performed on the comments. The music files are then played in a virtual three - dimensional environment where each song has a corresponding frequency spectrum and a stream of comments that are color - coordinated to represent how positive or negative it is. The user can traverse the virtual space to explore different songs.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote a Python script that uses multiprocessing to concurrently download and process SoundCloud files as it retrieves SoundCloud comments and communicates with an Azure web service that runs a sentiment analysis on the comments and gives it a score based on how positive or negative the comment is. Each music file's comments, the comments' scores, and additional information about the comments are written in a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file. The CSV file for each song is accessed by Unity, which uses C# with Visual Studio as an IDE to parse the CSV and create the corresponding frequency spectrum and comments. We then designed the virtual environment in Unity to produce a visual layout that displays the frequency spectrum and streams the comments according to their time stamp on SoundCloud for each song.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since we were working with VR, the technology we were using was very immature. We initially started out with Unreal Engine for our project - however, we quickly found that Unreal's audio engine was buggy and unreliable. After too many hours, we switched to Unity, a tool which none of us had worked with. Unity was a huge learning curve, but we pushed through. However, we had more issues - Unity can't decode MP3's and our plan to stream from SoundCloud was over. Instead, we did some trickery using Python to preprocess the MP3's into WAV files before feeding them to Unity. On the backend, we struggled through Microsoft Azure, which was also new technology to us. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're really proud of combining our interests in Machine Learning and Virtual Reality together to create a unique program that enhances user experience in listening to music.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned new technologies such as Microsoft Azure, Unity, and how to integrate these different technologies together. Additionally, we learned a new language in C#.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HearVR</h2>\n<p>We would like to make HearVR a world that generates music automatically based on the person's preferences and which songs they listened to.  In addition, we would like to make this a networked experience, so multiple people can listen in on the same session</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/liujas000/HearVR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/liujas000/HearVR\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Inpatient Decision", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Inpatient Decision \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/617/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>How to choose a hospital for treatment? -&gt; Inpatient Decision</h1>\n<p>This web app allows consumers to explore potential hospitals to visit when they must undergo a specific procedure.

Next, our local computers were notified whenever the database changed, and executed appropriate commands -- whether that be train an image classifier or fly a drone.</p>\n<p>To get the non-programmable drone to become a search drone, we had it live stream its video feed to an Android phone, and we had a script that constantly took screenshots of the Android phone and stored them on our computer. Then we could use this images either for training data or to classify them in real time, using image segmentation and IBM Watson.</p>\n<p>To train a classifier with only your voice, we would take the search term and use the Bing Search API to get images associated with that term. This served as the training data. We would then feed this training data into IBM Watson to build a classifier. This classifier could later be used for the search drone.

More specifically, it allows participants to pool their money into a smart contract that will pay out to a specified target if and only if a threshold percentage of contributors to the pool, weighted by contribution amount, votes that the specified target has indeed carried out an action by a specified due date.</p>\n<p>Example: A company pollutes a river, negatively affecting everyone nearby. Residents would like the river to be cleaned up, and are willing to pay for it, but only if the river is cleaned up. Solution: Residents use Ether on a Stick to pool their funds together that will pay out to the company if and only if a specified proportion of contributors to the pool vote that the company has indeed cleaned up the river.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Ether on a Stick implements with code a game theoretical mechanism called a Dominant Assurance Contract that coordinates the voluntary creation of public goods in the face of the free rider problem. It is a decentralized app (or \"dapp\") built on the Ethereum network, implementing a \"smart contract\" in Serpent, Ethereum's Python-like contract language. Its decentralized and trustless nature enables the creation of agreements without a 3rd party escrow who can be influenced or corrupted to determine the wrong user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The first 20 hours of the hackathon were mostly spent setting up and learning how to use the Ethereum client and interact with the network. A significant portion was also spent planning the exact specifications of the contract and deciding what mechanisms would make the network most resistant to attack. Despite the lack of any kind of API reference, writing the contract itself was easier, but deploying it to Ethereum testnet was another challenge, as large swaths of the underlying technology hasn't been built yet.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ether on a Stick</h2>\n<p>We'd like to take a step much closer to a game-theoretically sound system (don't quote us, we haven't written a paper on it) by implementing a sort of token-based reputation system, similar to that of Augur. In this system, a small portion of pooled funds are set aside to be rewarded to reputation token bearing oracles that correctly vote on outcomes of events. \"Correctly voting\" means voting with the majority of the other randomly selected oracles for a given event. We would also have to restrict events to only those which are easily and publically verifiable; however, by decoupling voting from contribution, this bypasses a Sybil attack wherein malicious actors (or the contract-specified target of the funds) can use a large amount of financial capital to sway the vote in their favor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ethereum</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">python-(serpent)</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/phlip9/ether-on-a-stick\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/phlip9/ether-on-a-stick\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["The Queen's Speech", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Queen's Speech \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/233/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Having fun!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Queen's Speech \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/234/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Queen's Speech \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/235/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Entering the virtual reality environment</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Queen's Speech \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/236/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Replaying your speech after recording</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Queen's Speech \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/237/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Viewing your speech results</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Gone are the days of practicing public speaking in a mirror.

Using 3D head tracking, we are able to give real time feedback on where the speaker is looking during the speech so that users can improve their interaction with the audience. We also allow the users to play their speech back in order to listen to pace, intonation, and content. We are working on providing immediate feedback on the number of \"um\"s and \"like\"s to improve eloquence and clarity of speech. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Incorporating Adobe After Effects and the Unity game engine, we used C# scripting to combine the best of 360 degree imagery and speech feedback.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Connecting to the Microsoft Project Oxford proved more difficult than expected on our Mac laptops than the typical PC.

It runs on two separate platforms that communicate their data with each other.  The first part of our solution is a mobile Android Application.  In this application, the user can enter Admin mode and create their settings for voice control and right and wrong answers.  Then the user or their family members can create stimuli that will then be used in their game.  The game then will show the user pictures of people, places, or memories, and ask them what the picture is of.  The user can then use voice commands to tell the application what is in that picture.  If the user gets the answer right, he scores a point and continue playing the game.  This data is then sent to the second part of this solution.  But, there is an additional part of the mobile application.</p>\n<h2>Location Services for Tracking the Patient</h2>\n<p>One important concern for dementia patients is that they begin to wander and don't remember where they were going or how they got there, and most importantly, they don't remember how to get home.  So in our mobile application, we have incorporated location services that keep track of the user in real time.  The user can go and check how far he has strayed from home by simply pressing a single button, and this will send data to our web application as well.  In addition, with the integration of the Uber API, the user can simply press a single button to call for an uber to bring them home using the location they are currently at.</p>\n<h2>Web Application</h2>\n<p>The second portion of this hack, is the web application hosted by Microsoft Azure.  The web application allows the user to log into their dashboard and access information about themselves in the case that they begin to forget things from their history.  We focused on the personal aspect of this mental illness, such that the patient could trigger their memories or answer the questions the ask over and over again by viewing this web page.  So, once they log in, they will have access to the most basic of information which includes their name, birthday, phone number, address, and a link to 911 in case of an emergency.  They will see links to \"Family\", \"Friends\", \"Memories\", or \"Home\" with corresponding pictures.  If the user clicks on the <strong>Family</strong> or <strong>Friends</strong> tab, they will be brought to their contacts page, where they have access to a database of family and friends' contact information along with corresponding pictures of the contact.  This page shows the contact's picture, their relation to the user, their phone number, address, and email.  This way, the user can contact them however they'd like.</p>\n<p>If the user were to click on the <strong>Home</strong> button, they would be brought to a map page.  Using the Google Maps API, we integrated a map that provides them with interactive access to past events in their life as well as their current location.  They can scan over the map to see where they were born and on what date.  Other examples of events that could potentially go on the map include the date of marriage or when their first child was born.</p>\n<p>If the user were to click on the <strong>Charts</strong> tab, they would be brought to a page full of data visualizations for various things regarding Dementia in general as well as their own personal data.  The first graph they would see is how well they are performing in the mobile application on a day to day basis.  Then, they'd have access to a pie chart providing awareness on the most common forms of Dementia, and lastly, they could see how much time they are spending within their home by gathering data from the location tracking aspect of the mobile application.  This data can be used to see how long they have wandered for to see how far away they might have gone, or track daily habits on how much time they typically spend in their homes on a day to day basis.  These data visualizations were made using Morris and Flot.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the user were to click on the <strong>Memories</strong> tab, they would be brought to an interactive time line that is easily customizable.  They can add new events or delete old ones.  This time line will show them the date, time, place, information, and a picture of the event taking place at the current time.  And the user can swipe through events to recall what he or she has done throughout their life as well as view pictures of the event.  This is really important to the user because this will provide them answers to a lot of questions, such as who was at which event and what exactly took place or when the event took place and what the importance was.  It provides the user not only with information about the date, but with information on when it happened and pictures for further memory recollection.</p>\n<h2>Purpose</h2>\n<p>As some of our team member have witness how hard it is for Dementia patients first hand, we thought this series of applications would come in great use not only for the patient themselves, but for their families and care takers.  We put everything a patient would need in one easy to access place.  They can view their memories, call for an Uber if they get lost, play memory games and track their progress, they have access to a database of contacts, and they have location services so their caretaker can see how far from home they are.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">flot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">morris</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">voice-command</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://treehacksmemento.azurewebsites.net/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://treehacksmemento.azurewebsites.net/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>treehacksmemento.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/caelooney/TreeHacks2016.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/caelooney/TreeHacks2016.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Gchorba/memento\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Gchorba/memento\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lash81/Memento/commits?author=lash81\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lash81/Memento/commits?author=lash81\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the Android app, including implementing the Uber API and auto-launching the app to display a reminder, even if the app has been exited.

Even after you find the places you want to visit, you still need to find out when they're open, how far away they are from one another, and work within your budget. With Wander, automatically create an itinerary based on your preferences \u2013 just pick where you want to go, and we'll handle the rest for you.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Wander shows you the top destinations, events, and eats wherever your travels take you, with your preferences, budget, and transportation in mind. For each day of your trip, Wander creates a schedule for you with a selection of places to visit, lunch, and dinner. It plans around your meals, open hours, event times, and destination proximity to make each day run as smoothly as possible.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the backend on Node.js and Express which uses the Foursquare API to find relevant food and travel destinations and schedules the itinerary based on the event type, calculated distances, and open hours. The native iOS client is built in Swift. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a hard time finding all the event data that we wanted in one place. In addition, we found it challenging to sync the information between the backend and the client.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re really proud of our mascot, Little Bloop, and the overall design of our app \u2013 we worked hard to make the user experience as smooth as possible. We\u2019re also proud of the way our team worked together (even in the early hours of the morning!), and we really believe that Wander can change the way we travel. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>It was surprising to discover that there were so many ways to build off of our original idea for Wander and make it more useful for travelers. After laying the technical foundation for Wander, we kept brainstorming new ways that we could make the itinerary scheduler even more useful, and thinking of more that we could account for \u2013 for instance, how open hours of venues could affect the itinerary. We also learned a lot about the importance of design and finding the best user flow in the context of traveling and being mobile.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Wander</h2>\n<p>We would love to continue working on Wander, iterating on the user flow to craft the friendliest end experience while optimizing the algorithms for creating itineraries and generating better destination suggestions. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/foursquare\">foursquare</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Appception ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OS2R2g2-TBw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Appception  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/321/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Appception  \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/368/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Appception  \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/322/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Everyone and their dog have a big idea for the next hit app but most people lack the skills or resources to build them.</li>\n<li>Having used some commercial app-building and prototyping tools in the past, we consider them inefficient as they don't reflect what the app is actually going to look like until it is run on a real device.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Appception allows you to build mobile apps on your iPhone through a simple drag and drop interface.

You could even participate through a public computer in a library, removing the need to own a device altogether!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The game allows user-created scavenger hunts to be uploaded to the server.  Then other users can join by emailing the relevant email address or texting commands to our phone number.  The user will then be sent instructions on how to play and updates as the game goes on.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We have a Microsoft Azure server backend that implements the Twilio and SendGrid APIs.  All of our code is written in python.  When you send us a text or email, Twilio and SendGrid notify our server which processes the data, updates the server-side persistent records, and replies to the user with new information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>While sending emails is very straightforward with SendGrid and Twilio works well both for inbound and outbound texts, setting up inbound email turned out to be very difficult due to the need to update the mx registry, which takes a long time to propagate.

We also wanted to explore the idea that not many people understand how different medical conditions work conjunctively. </li>\n<li>Often, people don't realize that medical conditions don't happen one at a time. They can happen together, thus raising complications with prescribed medication that, when taken at the same time, can be dangerous together and may lead to unpredictable outcomes. These are issues that the medical community is well aware of but your average Joe might be oblivious to. </li>\n<li>Our platform encourages people to ask questions and discuss the effects of living with two or more common diseases, and take a closer look at the apex that form when these diseases begin to affect the effects of each other on one's body.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In essence, the platform wants patients to submit questions about their health, discuss these topics in a freestyle chat system while exploring statistics, cures and related diseases. </li>\n<li>By making each disease, symptom, and medication a tag rather than a category, the mixing of all topics is what fuels the full potential of this platform. Patients, and even physicians, who might explore the questions raised regarding the overlap between, for example Diabetes and HIV, contribute to the collective curiosity to find out what exactly happens when a patient is suffering both diseases at the same time, and the possible outcomes from the interactions between the drugs that treat both diseases. </li>\n<li>Each explored topic is searchable and the patient can delve quite deep into the many combinations of concepts. GitCured really is fueled by the questions that patients think of about their healthcare, and depend on their curiosity to learn and a strong community to discuss ideas in chat-style forums.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Languages used: Node.js, Sockets.IO, MongoDB, HTML/CSS, Javascript, ChartJS, Wolfram Alpha, Python, Bootstrap</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We had problems in implementing a multi-user real-time chat using sockets.io for every question that has been asked on our platform.</li>\n<li>Health data is incredibly hard to find. There are certain resources, such as data.gov and university research websites that are available, but there is no way to ensure quality data that can be easily parseable and usable for a health hack. Most data that we did find didn't help us much with the development of this app but it provided an insight to us to understand the magnitude of the health related problems.</li>\n<li>Another issue we faced was to differentiate ourselves from other services that meet part of the criteria of the prompt. Our focus was to critically think how each medical concept affects people, along with providing patients a platform to discuss their healthcare. The goal was to design a space that encourages creative and curious thinking, and ask questions that might never have been previously answered. We wanted to give patients a space to discuss and critically think about how each medical concept affects each other. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were pretty surprised we got this far into the development of this app. While it isn't complete, as apps never are, we had a great experience of putting ideas together and building a health-focused web platform from scratch.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a very big issue that there is no central and reliable source for health data. People may have clear statistics on finance or technology, but there is so much secrecy and inconsistencies that come with working with data in the medical field. This creates a big, and often invisible, problem where computer scientists find it harder and harder to analyze biomedical data compared to other types of data. If we hadn't committed to developing a patient platform, I think our team would have worked on designing a central bank of health data that can be easily implementable in new and important health software. Without good data, development of bio technology will always be slow when developers find themselves trapped or stuck.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Mihirmathur/treehacks-health\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Mihirmathur/treehacks-health\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gitcured.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gitcured.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gitcured.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Seisir - Epilepsy Detection and Treatment Device", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Seisir - Epilepsy Detection and Treatment Device \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/287/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Seisir Epilepsy Detection Band</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Seisir - Epilepsy Detection and Treatment Device \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/428/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Metrics</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of our team members is an undergraduate intern at Boston Children's Hospital in the epilepsy center.

Although still in development, our current version of Seisir intakes data from a custom built biosensor that identifies changes in skin conductance as well as a six-axis accelerometer and gyroscope. Data is processed in real time locally on an Arduino 101 board powered by Intel. Data is uploaded to a secure server and can be accessed via a mobile Android device. In cases where Seisir detects a high likelihood of seizure activity, the program contacts a caretaker or medical staff via text, or could signal an implantable device. Seisir has a strong potential to save lives by notifying others in emergency cases.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our current program utilizes a combination of technologies starting with the an Arduino 101 board powered by Intel. The program connects the android device via Bluetooth with a mobile application to obtain various sensor data. This data is then passed through the app to the cloud. Our program identifies seizure activity from the sensor data originally recorded by custom biosensors. The cloud system, android app and Arduino board all monitor for abnormal activity, specifically moments when seizure activity is identified. Upon receiving a seizure alert, the android app notifies emergency contacts via a traditional text message.</p>\n<p>We intend to improve the accuracy of our machine-learning platform by creating a research database wherein healthcare providers can manually mark seizure activity as well, minimizing any false detection rate.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since the Seizure platform requires integrating a combination of multiple different technologies, devices and programming languages. This cross compatibility created the majority of our implementation challenges.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully developed a custom biosensor using only wires, resistors and code that can successfully detect changes in skin conductance, a major factor in identifying seizure activity. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to implement and code on an Arduino 101 board and connect biosensors. We believe that Seisir demonstrates that the Arduino board could spearhead significant clinical advancements.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Seisir - Epilepsy Detection and Treatment Device</h2>\n<p>It is our hope that the Intel technologies behind Seisir have the opportunity to be used in a research setting that is clinically relevant to seizures and other epileptiform activity. Since one of our team members interns within the neurology department at Boston Children's Hospital and works with epilepsy patients on a daily basis, it is our hope that the Seisir / Intel combination platform have the opportunity to be tested within a clinical setting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.seisir.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.seisir.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.seisir.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1187111-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1187111-overview\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>emedicine.medscape.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3369522/#B10\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3369522/#B10\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://web.media.mit.edu/~zher/papers/Poh-etal-Neurology.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://web.media.mit.edu/~zher/papers/Poh-etal-Neurology.pdf\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>web.media.mit.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/epilepsy-101/facts-about-seizures-and-epilepsy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/epilepsy-101/facts-about-seizures-and-epilepsy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.epilepsy.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["lovedotjs", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"lovedotjs \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/934/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Enter two github handles</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"lovedotjs \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/932/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Calculates the percent compatible two people are by the percent of code written in common languages</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"lovedotjs \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/390/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>var bae = require('love.js')\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It's a hackathon.

", "", "", ""]], ["UCLA Rideshare", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>On Friday morning, a friend from another college asked me to post to the private UCLA ridesharing Facebook group for her since she needed a ride from LA to San Diego. I've never used the group so I kind of forgot it existed, but I was surprised to see its 4,500 members post regularly (maybe once/hour). That said, it was the most cluttered, inefficient space to organize rides, and there shockingly isn't an already-existing, university-limited ridesharing platform.</p>\n<p>Taken aback by the chaos, it seemed to me like it would be much, much simpler to upload the simple rideshare date/location/contact information to two respective tables: one for requests, and one for offers. Like with the (verified UCLA-only) Facebook group, these tables should be easy to join and view, but only for authenticated students (to add a sense of safety). Also, the contact information should remain fairly private.</p>\n<p>The idea was fairly simple, but I have never coded a web app before, which made this a good introductory project. Friday night I started with HTML (using Brackets, also new to me), then CSS and JavaScript Saturday, which led to Firebase, JQuery, Node.js, and finally Bootstrap late into Saturday night. Oh, and basic Github for this submission.</p>\n<p>It's probably obvious that there were many many challenges stemming from this complete lack of experience. How to start, how to make code become a product, how to input and store data, how to break away from Brackets (right after I learned to use it), make a database (the Firebase cheater version anyways), use a command window for node.js, the list goes on... The one remaining challenge I have yet to solve is how to cancel requests once the time has passed, but I believe it should be possible using Moment.js.</p>\n<p>I know my site isn't a work of beauty, but hey, I knew basically nothing coming in (basic C++) and came out with a fairly functional website in these 36 hours, so I'm really happy with it! I would love to give HUGE shoutouts to my mentors Trever, Bhuwan, Aneesh, and Jenn for help with the icky back-end server/authentication stuff and guiding the general flow of the site. :)</p>\n<p>Not only did I learn the foundations of 8-9 (?!?!) new languages/programs, but I learned a lot about how to learn new languages (the Internet is a wonderful, wonderful place). I really just didn't have an idea of what web development involved until TreeHacks, but the people I've met here have been fantastic and so helpful, I really couldn't have done it without their guidance and suggestions.</p>\n<p>As evident by the traffic in the disorderly Facebook group, UCLA is ideal for such a rideshare because of its massive student body which is mostly based in California, so I'm not sure if expansion to other schools would be as beneficial. For me, the immediate next steps are to get the site to a live domain name, make sure each page is secured (learn cookies), and let the public test it.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to the TreeHacks organizers for putting on this lovely event! :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ashleyh3/UCLA-Rideshare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ashleyh3/UCLA-Rideshare\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["streetvends", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Street Vendors</h1>\n<h2>Lead Dev</h2>\n<p>Kevin Yang  |  Email: <a href=\"mailto:kyang6@stanford.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">kyang6@stanford.edu</a>  |  Phone:4803160382  |  GitHub: github.com/kyang6\nWill Hang   |  Email: <a href=\"mailto:willhang@stanford.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">willhang@stanford.edu</a>|  Phone:8586108453  |  GitHub: github.com/#</p>\n<h2>To Do</h2>\n<p>Currently location of the vendor is set by the user choosing to click the button \"update location\" on the show page of the vendor. \n    Need to Add\n    - Make the ability to review the vendors\n    - validation, only allow users to update the location if they are using the wechat browser\n    - On load update the location\n    - Send location data to database where algorithms figure out if the location is legitimate and if it is take all the recent locations and average into the location where the vendor will most likely be\n    - Main interface will be list of vendor name and distance, with a search bar\n    - After clicking on a vendor a map will open up, users can also use this to find vendors\n    - Create api that allows other apps to query for street vendors\n    - Add validation algorithm to determine if the review from the user is legitimate, if the user is using wechat.

What he saw was less than ideal. The lesson was to build an Asteroids-style game with Python. The instructor hoped that constructing a game would be sufficient motivation to keep the students' attention. But it was very hard for any student to focus long enough to make significant progress. John wondered if it might be possible to make code more interactive and provide more immediate, interesting objectives (on the order of 5 lines of code instead of 100). So the Edoo team formed and it began to create a game (of sorts) designed to teach object-oriented principles.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The main interface has a 3D scene, an XML script editor, a javascript editor, and a console. (It is something like JSFiddle, except instead of building a webpage, the user interacts with the 3D scene.) For example, with just a few lines of XML, a novice coder can build a tank, add some blocks to the scene, and then instruct the tank to aim at the blocks and fire! (The user can select objects in the scene by clicking on them--this gives a handle for the object that can be inserted into the code.)</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For maximum accessibility, the project is based only on Html5 and Javascript. In particular, the 3D engine is Babylon.js and the physics engine is Oimo.js. We chose this platform so that it would be easy for anyone with a modern browser to get started using it right away.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There is not a lot of documentation for Babylon.js or Oimo.js, so we had a lot of debugging to do, and we had to adapt some of our plans around poorly implemented features. (The physics impostors used for collisions were particularly finicky.)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We completed all the milestones necessary to provide a clear demonstration of the eventual game/coding environment we have in mind.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We gained experience with Javascript, and the challenges that come with using less-popular APIs. We also were amazed by the power of Html5 and its graphics acceleration capabilities. Also, this was John's first hackathon, so he really enjoyed the new experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Edoo</h2>\n<p>We would like to add more classes/features, provide very instructive documentation and error handling, and then try our project out on some of our less code-savvy friends. We would love to see this project eventually be deployed in schools that are struggling to implement a computer science curriculum.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/willstogin/edoo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/willstogin/edoo\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Broaden", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>It's always hard to find people who share your interests and who have certain characteristics.

Smarter Tabs is a Chrome Extension that helps track how you are using your tabs and removes the one's that have been inactive for far too long. Smarter Tabs also keeps track of all the recently deleted tabs so that if you still need the information at your fingertips, you can easily access it through the form of links. By storing these tabs that have been inactive in the form of links, you can still access them but it is less resource intensive of your browser.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This was actually my very first Chrome extension and I also had little experience with Javascript before so it really was an adventure. I poured through a lot of documentation about how everything goes in together and I also got help from mentors along the way, which was incredibly beneficial. This essentially tracks how long its been since a tab was last active and at the end of the timer, the tab will close, and its information will be saved.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into and What's Next</h2>\n<p>Pretty much I ran into a lot of bugs haha. I would pass variables that were the wrong type into all sorts of functions and things just broke. I spent quite a bit of time through the console debugging. It was a jarring, yet rewarding experience.\nI learned a lot through this project and I feel now with the power of Google search I can figure anything out! I wish to enhance the ways that Smarter Tabs detects usage and hopefully later, as time goes by, Smarter Tabs will learn more and more from the user so that the longer they use this extension, the more capable it will be of organizing their tabs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jackyang127/Smart-Tabs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jackyang127/Smart-Tabs\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Hotkey", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hotkey \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/256/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>OSX Tray App</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hotkey \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/255/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Chrome Plugin</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hotkey \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/257/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hotkey \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/258/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>OSX Netflix Window</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you ever logged into your netflix account, just to find it blocked by another person using it?

We loved it so much that we knew we had to keep going, and TreeHacks was the perfect opportunity to immerse ourselves in our first hackathon. We knew we wanted to combine our interests in music, art, and CS to create something special, and so AudioArt was born. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>AudioArt is a unique platform that detects audio input, and uses varying pitches to dynamically generate a phyllotactic spiral in real time. The program detects pitches in sequence, and uses the frequency of each pitch to determine the seed angle and RBG color of a phyllotactic spiral that is generated specifically for that pitch. The resulting phyllotactic spirals are displayed in a graphics window, and create a colorful, animated piece of digital artwork.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We implemented open-source pitch-detection code to detect audio input and convert it to numerical data. We then designed a mathematical algorithm that uses Java Swing interactors to generate a customized phyllotactic spiral using this data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Implementing multithreading in order to accomplish multiple tasks concurrently, while also transferring information to one of the threads.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're incredibly proud to have finished our first ever hackathon! All three of us team members have less than two quarters of computer science under our belts, so successfully building AudioArt within 36 hours was an exciting achievement.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to be persistent, even when we encountered bugs that seemed impossible to fix. Furthermore, we learned to successfully integrate open-source software into our code, and to use multithreading to run multiple processes simultaneously. Most of all, we experienced what it was like to code under a time crunch.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AudioArt</h2>\n<p>We hope that in the future, we'll be able to extend AudioArt to generate many more works of art based on audio input. Our ultimate goal is to create an immersive experience that seamlessly bridges music and visual art, and which uses elements like volume, tone, tempo, and dissonance to represent unique patterns through art.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tarapiyer/AudioArt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tarapiyer/AudioArt\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["This is our team's first hackathon, and AudioArt clearly combines our interests in music and visual art.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>All of us have gone through the lengthy and often inefficient process of going to the optometrist and then painstakingly reading thorough charts to determine visual acuity - what if there was a much better and faster way to determine it? After talking with Dr. Peter Karth of the Stanford School of Medicine, we realized that there was potential to develop a mobile app that can instantly detect visual acuity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Instant Acuity allows patients to quickly detect their visual acuity and for providers to check up on their patients and schedule appointments if necessary. The visual acuity detection system solves two major problems  - first it allows for the user to speak the letters he or she sees rather than manually enter them (which is beneficial especially for the elderly population) and second it uses facial recognition and subsequent distance calculations to make sure the user is not holding the device either too far or too close.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Instant Acuity was developed using Xcode with Objective-C as the primary programming language. IBM Bluemix was utilized for speech to text conversion while Facial Recognition (via Apple API) was utilized to to determine whether the user holding the phone too close or far away. Design was done within Xcode and with Microsoft PowerPoint. Also, the LogMAR Visual Acuity scale was utilized to determine the user's vision (the varying letter sizes are based on a mathematical formula we developed based on the minimum angle of resolution of a user looking at a particular letter).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Using IBM Blumix to implement speech to text proved to be difficult - we had to go through several iterations to implement the API effectively. Moreover, facial recognition also proved to be a significant challenge (using the front facing camera on an iPhone).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of being able to synthesize many varied components together - IBM Bluemix, Apple's Facial Recognition API, and Xcode's User Interface together to create a promising product - all at our very first hackathon!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Never stop hacking- where there is a will there is a way! While working out bugs and logical errors can be frustrating, ultimately there is a solution and finding it is immensely rewarding.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Instant Acuity: A Mobile App for Vision Testing</h2>\n<p>Instant Acuity is a very promising concept and the prototype demonstrates that it could have a revolutionary impact on vision testing.

However, we often find ourselves taking breaks from work to go to Facebook, then often spending hours slacking off online, our precious minutes disappearing as we just keep scrolling on. We not only help users become more aware of how much time they are spending online, but deliver a non-intrusive intervention that encourages them to spend time on other sites.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Effic is a tool that both helps inform users of how much time they are spending online (it uses Chrome extensions\u2019 history functionality to estimate total time spent on sites over the past 3 months). It then delivers two types of interventions by inserting items into users\u2019 newsfeed. The first type shows how much they time have spent in that current session. The second type of item shows links to work-related sites they have earlier visited.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Chrome extension and a web service. The web service is built using the MEAN (mongo, express, angular, node) stack. We use D3 to help us make visualizations, and use angular-material for the frontent UI components. The heuristic we use for estimating time spent on sites via the browsing history is that we reconstruct the time users spent on each url and consider the interstitial periods (cutting off long idle times as times when the user was not using the browser); we compared the times estimated by this heuristic to the actual recorded time and it is highly correlated.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We make use of browsing histories in a novel way. We not only inform users about their browsing habits, but also help improve them. Facebook feed injection is a passive, non-intrusive way to deliver persuasive messaging to users.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Effic</h2>\n<p>Outside just your Facebook feed, can we inject these messages into other slacking sites? For example, once you finish watching a video on Youtube, can we show you a message encouraging you to go off to Coursera and finish watching your lectures? </p>\n<p>We also want to deliver more rich types of interventions. Right now we just show you links to some past sites that you have spent time on in the past 24 hours which are work-related. But can we use your browsing history to recommend new materials to you? For example, can we show you educational materials you\u2019d be interested in?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/polymer\">polymer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://effic.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://effic.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>effic.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gkovacs/effic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gkovacs/effic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["grateful", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grateful \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/328/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grateful \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/260/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grateful \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/161/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grateful \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/330/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grateful \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/162/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grateful \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/424/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grateful \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/163/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Studies have shown that writing down three positive things about your day can improve your outlook on life.

Just like our vision, the digital content we consume today is limited by nature. Technology that is increasingly focused on serving individualized content only serves to reinforce the \u201cecho chamber\u201d effect \u2013 we believe our perspectives are the only ones out there. </p>\n<p>Yet, it\u2019s also increasingly important to understand diverse perspectives in a more connected modern world. We want to allow users to search for information in a more holistic and unbiased way, navigating the bewildering deluge of information and polarizing opinions on the Internet in a more intuitive way.  Using sentiment analysis and natural language processing, we seek to link search terms to articles exemplifying a spectrum of emotions, shedding light on all angles of an issue. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>In its current iteration, Dragonfly exists as both a web application and also a browser extension.  The web application is a search engine that yields a variety of articles on a numerical linear scale.  The scale is a measure of the sentiment expressed in the writing, ranging from negative to neutral to positive.  We group articles based on common sentiment and uses natural language processing to extract keyphrases that are representative of the group\u2019s point of view. This way, users can not only see a overview of the distribution of sentiments on a topic, but understand on a real-world level how different groups are approaching and talking about the issue.</p>\n<p>We also created a browser extension that allows users to be aware of bias during their day-to-day browsing. The browser extension gives a rating that is based on the relative sentiment expressed on the current webpage compared to other topically relevant articles.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The web application has a backend written using Django and uses the charts.js library to deliver front end visuals.  The browser extension is written in standard html, javascript, and jquery.<br/>\nFor sentiment analysis we leverage IBM\u2019s Alchemy platform.  Our web app uses Alchemy\u2019s news aggregator API to find articles and associated sentiment ratings. \nThe chrome extension uses the separate Alchemy sentiment expression analyzer.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were difficulties in defining the scope of what we wanted to accomplish with the given machine learning tools at our disposal.  Human attitudes can have very subtle gradations that are very difficult for machines to characterize.

It's like an operating system.</p>\n<p>You copy it to a SD card, put it in the Pi, and turn the thing on, and plug it into a monitor and a keyboard. It gives you a console. It talks to the Pi's video card, to the serial device on the board, and to a PS/2 keyboard.

The key insight there was using gc-sections in the linker and then stubbing out the remaining symbols.</p>\n<p>Rust is also missing a couple important things from C: I had a ton of trouble aligning things in memory and getting data from the linker into the program.

We didn't want to settle for something that was just functional, so we added the craziest game mechanic we could think of to maximize the number of problems we would run into: a map that has no up or down, only forward. The aesthetic of the game is based on Minecraft (a game I admit I have never played).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The game can host up to 5 players on a local network. Using the keyboard and the mouse on your computer, you can walk around an environment shaped like a giant cube covered in forest, and shoot bolts of energy at your friends. When you reach the threshold of the next plane of the cube, a simple command re-orients your character such that your gravity vector is perpendicular to the next plane, and you can move onwards. The last player standing wins.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>First we spent a few (many) hours learning the skills necessary. My teammate familiarized themself with a plethora of Unity functions in order to code the game mechanics we wanted. I'm a pretty decent 3D modeler, but I've never used Maya before and I've never animated a bipedal character. I spent a long while adjusting myself to Maya, and learning how the Mecanim animation system of Unity functions. Once we had the basics, we started working on respective elements: my teammate the gravity transitions and the networking, and myself the character model and animations. Later we combined our work and built up the 3D environment and kept adding features and debugging until the game was playable. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The gravity transitions where especially challenging. Among a panoply of other bugs that individually took hours to work through or around, the gravity transitions where not fully functional until more than a day into the project. We took a break from work and brainstormed, and we came up with a simpler code structure to make the transition work. We were delighted when we walked all up and around the inside of our cube-map for the first time without our character flailing and falling wildly. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Besides the motion capture for the animations and the textures for the model, we built a fully functional, multiplayer shooter with a complex, one-of-a-kind gameplay mechanic. It took 36 hours, and we are proud of going from start to finish without giving up. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Besides the myriad of new skills we picked up, we learned how valuable a hackathon can be. It is an educational experience nothing like a classroom. Nobody chooses what we are going to learn; we choose what we want to learn by chasing what we want to accomplish. By chasing something ambitious, we inevitably run into problems that force us to develop new methodologies and techniques. We realized that a hackathon is special because it's a constant cycle of progress, obstacles, learning, and progress. Progress stacks asymptotically towards a goal until time is up and it's time to show our stuff.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gravity First</h2>\n<p>The next feature we are dying to add is randomized terrain. We built the environment using prefabricated components that I built in Maya, which we arranged in what we thought was an interesting and challenging arrangement for gameplay. Next, we want every game to have a different, unpredictable six-sided map by randomly laying out the pre-fabs according to certain parameters..</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maya\">maya</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Design, 3D modeling, animation, level design", ""]], ["Pigeon Point", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IPuJsGpe6o?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pigeon Point \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/446/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pigeon Point \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/106/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyone has those friends who just add you to their group chats, and then you get incessantly flooded with notifications. After muting conversations, you'll miss invitations and key messages, mainly because you didn't see them. Now there's a way to manage your notifications <em>and</em> be sure that you miss out.</p>\n<p>It was especially helpful for the TreeHacks Slack group. Especially since we're hacking, we preferred not to be notified much, or spend time just to see where lunch is. It also helped us find out that a guy just dropped off an Echo in the hardware booth, and we promptly intercepted it from another team. :D</p>\n<p>We also built this for accessibility. Most people with vision disorders or physical disabilities have a hard time talking to their friends (since most of us use instant messaging, not calls). Our project would allow these people to have the Echo talk to them and basically act as their social assistant.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>To summarize group messages from GroupMe, you could tell Alexa to summarize whichever group you want. She'll then tell you what topics were discussed, and the main points said in each topic. She'll even tell you about what certain people were feeling. If you don't fully understand the messages, you could ask her for the context, and she'll tell you what was said before and after. The same functions work if you want your Slack messages summarized.</p>\n<p>For Slack specifically, we built a Slackbot, which you could enter your commands to select which group to summarize. All the other functions above apply here too! </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For the summarization itself, we implemented Jolo Balbin's thesis on summarizing a single topic text block. It involved finding the most common ideas, and ranking the sentences based on how similar they were to other sentences. This was coded in Python, and lives inside an AWS Lambda function. </p>\n<p>Most group chats have many conversations going on though, so we also built a classifier function using IBM Alchemy's concept extractor and clustered similar words together using NLTK. We then ran the summarization script on each of the specific conversation topics and got out key points.</p>\n<p>The Slack Bot was hosted using a Python flask image running on Microsoft Azure, that's where all the API calls and data lived. This was called on by the Lambda function on AWS. We then used our Lambda function and Azure backend to link functionality to the Echo.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a hard time when we first ran our summarizer on the Slack conversations, because it wasn't optimized for multiple topics. We fixed this by splitting the conversation.</p>\n<p>It was hard to get our hands on an Echo, so we developed most of it without being able to see results on the go. Our Slack summarization backend saved us though. </p>\n<p>Also, we had a hard time deploying packages on AWS because it needed us to make special versions of NLTK and other packages to run.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're particularly proud about implementing one of NLP's hardest problems, and how we worked around the limitations of the thesis by classifying messages.</p>\n<p>Also, we're proud of building something that would help us and almost everyone, and how it helps a certain segment greatly.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>All of us were well versed in Python and backend, but not so much on web development. We had a fun time learning about deployment and learning about how servers communicate with each other.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pigeon Point</h2>\n<p>Link our backend to Facebook Messenger, text messages, and even news sites. Then we can get acquired by Microsoft's GroupMe or Facebook. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag

However, for most of the landscape photos, whose brightness usually covers a large span, this method is naturally flawed. Meanwhile, as to PC software, for example, Photoshop; despite of its powerful functions, selection is always indispensable and toning is as a result painful and time-taking.\n\u00a0\nBy accepting the ideas of image partition and semantics analysis, we have achieved a powerful automatic image processing tool. It can automatically recognize different objects and then make adjustment according to its properties, for example, recognizing different facades of walls and fixing backlight shadow problems.\nBecause of its outstanding performance and portability, the project can greatly benefit the common people who have little knowledge about photo toning. Meanwhile, for photographers, who always have huge quantities of landscape photos in their camera, the product can also save plenty of time. Besides, considering the transplantable developing tools used, the product can be easily implemented on any mobile or embedded system.\n\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Technical Issues</h2>\n<p>The project mainly exploits image partition and semantics analysis technologies, and develops series of image processing algorithms to implement auto toning.\nAs a preprocess for photo toning, image partition is used for making selections from the photo. Down-sampling and k-means partition are utilized to get a proper selection without too many noises.\nThe project used Wolfram as an approach to semantics analysis. With semantic explanation of photos, Photomagic decides how to tone the photo based on common sense like the sky is blue.\nMany basic image processing algorithms are also implemented to tone the photo, for example color balance is exploited for color adjustment and Gaussian blur is applied in glow effects.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Creators</h2>\n<p>\u00a0Hackers from Peking University</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/less\">less</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MarcWong/treehacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/MarcWong/treehacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Predictive VoIP", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>We wrote a one way VoIP server and client which performs better under lossy conditions by degrading more gracefully: it fills in dropped time slices with predicted sound</p>\n<p>Originally it used a deep model, but that wasn't fast enough for real time; so now it uses some crazy signal processing (this part made by Ishaan)</p>\n<p>If time permits, will add simple compression (currently planning to transmit uncompressed audio time slices), erasure codes, and throughput / packet drop forecasting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/shariq/predictive_voip\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/shariq/predictive_voip\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["TreeHacks PCL", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>I'm a US Air Force combat veteran.

A picture is taken from the door and a call is made to a cloud service in order to authenticate the user. Once the user has been authenticated, the door lock opens and the user is free to enter the door. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a variety of technologies to build this project. First a Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet and has a servo motor, a button and a camera connected to it. The Pi is running a python client which makes call to a Node.js app running on IBM Bluemix. The app handles requests to train and test image classifiers using the Visual Recognition Watson. We trained a classifier with 20 pictures of each of us and we tested the classifier to unseen data by taking a new picture through our system. To control the lock we connected a servo to the Raspberry Pi and we wrote C with the wiringPi library and PWM to control it. The lock only opens if we reach an accuracy of 70% or above. We determined this number after several tests. The servo moves the lock by using a 3d-printed adapter that connects the servo to the lock.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make our whole project on python, by using a library for the GPIO interface of the Pi and OpenCV for the facial recognition. However, we missed some OpenCV packages and we did not have the time to rebuild the library. Also the GPIO library on python was not working properly to control the servo motor. After encountering these issues, we moved the direction of our project to focus on building a Node.js app to handle authentication and the Visual Recognition service to handle the classification of users.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>What we are all proud of is that in just one weekend, we learned most of the skills required to finish our project. Ming learned 3D modeling and printing, and to program the GPIO interface on the Pi. Eddie learned the internet architecture and the process of creating a web app, from the client to the server. Atl learned how to use IBM technologies and to adapt to the unforeseen circumstances of the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sesame</h2>\n<p>The prototype we built could be improved upon by adding additional features that would make it more convenient to use. Adding a mobile application that could directly send the images from an individual\u2019s phone to Bluemix would make it so that the user could train the visual recognition application from anywhere and at anytime. Additionally, we have plans to discard the button and replace it with a proximity sensor so that the camera is efficient and only activates when an individual is present in front of the door.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wiring</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">python-client</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sketchup</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["FalseWiki", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration - Twitter bots</h2>\n<h2>What it does - Combine titles and descriptions from different Wikipedia articles</h2>\n<h2>How we built it - Hard work and python</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into - Black mold</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of - Not sleeping</h2>\n<h2>What we learned - Python is cool</h2>\n<h2>What's next for FalseWiki - Sentience</h2>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Barn", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Barn \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/267/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Upon login</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Barn \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/268/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Seeing someone else's request</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Barn \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/254/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Upon creating a request!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Barn \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/361/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Back in the day, when farmers wanted to build a barn, they knew they could not do it alone. Thus they held barn raisings, where everyone in the community was invited to attend and work for a day building a barn. Everyone came and enjoyed a productive day that also ended in a large party and a lot of community building. Fast forward to our current era.</p>\n<p>Silicon Valley has done a superb job of allowing you to get almost anything you want on demand, whether that be food, transportation, groceries, etc. However, despite the immense amount of good that has come about because of these services, many of us are now helping out our friends/community and receiving help from them much less than we did before. Thus often times, our communities are not as strong as they were in the past.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Barn allows you to easily help other people around you and get help yourself when you need it. It's not really for emergencies (call 911 for that!), nor for stuff you can get done using the myriad of on demand apps. But if you want a friend from Stanford to help you loft your bed or something, barn is for you!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Used the MapBox API to make a beautiful map of Stanford and OAuth login for Facebook.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Security is hard, especially since many interactions will be face to face! We decided to restrict to to Stanford students at first to reduce the chance of awkward and potentially dangerous encounters.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Barn</h2>\n<p>We are going to put the finishing touches on Barn and let you folks at Stanford use it!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oauth\">oauth</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/barners/treehacksbarn/src\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/barners/treehacksbarn/src\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Subliminal", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/062/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/063/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/064/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/065/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/066/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/067/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/068/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Subliminal \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/069/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Tree Hacks: Subliminal iOS App</h1>\n<p>A mobile application for those suffering from a mental illness. Many mental health professionals have trouble at times\ngiving a proper diagnosis or having a full understanding of what their patients go through. The goals of this mobile app \nwere the following:</p>\n<p>1) Be a platform where the patient can update how they are feeling from a scale of 1-10.</p>\n<p>2) Show the user a graph of how their mood has been all day or over the past week, etc..</p>\n<p>3) Have the app notify the user every set amount of time to update how they are feeling.</p>\n<p>4) Connect Mental Health professionals with patients with the chat feature.</p>\n<p>5) Patients can chat with all registered mental health professionals by username.</p>\n<p>6) If patient reports being suicidal and having a plan to do so, the app will imediately notify a mental health professional.</p>\n<p>7) Connect patients with their mental health professional by making it easier for mental health professionals to monitor their patients.</p>\n<h3><em>For the purposes of TreeHacks, this app was able to achieve the following:</em></h3>\n<p>1) allow patients and mental health providers to sign up for the service.</p>\n<p>2) Fully functional messaging platform between patients and mental health providers.</p>\n<p>3) Users are able to update how they are feeling throughout the day.</p>\n<p>4)Users are able to see how they have been doing over a period of time and are able to save the graph to their phone.</p>\n<h2>Authors</h2>\n<p>Unis Barakat (<a href=\"mailto:your_email@berkeley.edu\"

We hope you enjoy and do not forget the power your words have to change someone\u2019s world. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/glsl\">glsl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aashnamago/valentinesVR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/aashnamago/valentinesVR\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["3D Artist and Modeler, Sound Mixing, Level Design and Gameplay.", "", "", ""]], ["Ask Better", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3xM8sHGoiQ?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Critical thinking skills are now more important than ever.

I have friends who suffer from anxiety attacks, and there isn't always sometime to help them get through it. Currently breathing apps focus on meditation and sports rather than mental health, so they often are complicated, un-customizable, and cluttered, which is un-navigable to someone who needs a simple interface when they really need to breathe. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Breathe With Me is an app that allows you to set custom breathing patterns so that you can later use it to help you regulate your breathing and calm down. The pattern can be set two ways, manually adjusting the inhale exhale times or tapping to time your inhale exhale. Patterns can be deleted by holding down on them.</p>\n<p>Once a breathing pattern is created the in-app animation is synced to that breathing rhythm. In addition to the on screen animation, the phone also vibrates when you should inhale or exhale. This feature is especially important because some one having an attack may have a difficult time following an on screen animation, or prefer a position that hides their face, in which case a non-visual cue is imperative.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Android Studio</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The home screen list had many bugs with crashing, the circle animation view was difficult to configure and had skewed dimensions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The adjustable animation, the use of new widgets/features I haven't worked with before, the fact that it actually works. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>More about android programming, how working with graphics inside android goes, more file saving techniques.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Breathe With Me</h2>\n<p>A range of animations to choose from, more music choices, possible more complicated breathing patterns, maybe a \"soothing\" exercise that talks you through an episode.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ksun97/BreathWithMe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ksun97/BreathWithMe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Pulse", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5KAkvT6ITqo?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pulse \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/404/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pain input screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pulse \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/405/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pain severity rating</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pulse \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/406/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pain mapping</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pulse \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/407/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Log</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pulse \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/408/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pain type</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Hospital pain rating charts show the severity of pain, but when we spoke to medical professionals they wanted a greater level of detail.

This can help doctors triage incoming patients and monitor response to new treatment plans for patients with chronic pain.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Adobe Comet to rapidly iterate on a streamlined design, then moved to React Native to accelerate our mobile development process.

Uses iBeacons to mark your home.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Both of us were pretty familiar with iOS. We used Carthage for dependency management, and used RxSwift to handle asynchronous calls (MVVM). Used a lot of iOS native frameworks, along with OpenEars for the microphone input processing. We have a little bit of persistence running in the back, and as we're running on Realm it acts as a replacement for a fast RESTful api. At the moment, Arthur only accepts variations of \"YES\" and \"NO\" in his language model, but it isn't too difficult to make him more sophisticated if given the time. I'd like to think that this app is a solid mixture between a solid networking layer (or in this case, a persistence layer that pretends to be a networking layer), good native framework usage, beautiful frontend design, and clean and professional code. Go ahead and browse the repo!</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Dependency management. Switched between Carthage and Cocoapods for a bit before settling, which resulted in a stunted project before refractoring.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The app itself is gorgeous, and frankly is fairly sophisticated under the hood. The codebase is clean aside from a few rushed features, and though we didn't get to everything we wanted to, it would be easy to get back into working on this app.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Carthage or Cocoapods, just pick one and go.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Arthur</h2>\n<p>It's very easy to integrate pretty much any third party API into this app, and for the most part a lot of APIs make sense. We didn't ultimately make it to the point where we could warrant bypassing our core features to go for an API prize, but I'm thinking that we can expand on Arthur until he reaches the point that we thought he would be by the end of the hackathon.

According to Psychology Today, over 50% of college students rated their mental health as \"below average\" or \"poor.\" We know how difficult it is to take a step back from the inevitable onslaught of PSETs, social commitments, and extracurricular activities, so we wanted to make mental health resources more accessible, personalized, and fun. Journaling, music, calming visuals, and awareness of emotional trends are all clinically proven emotional boosters that are easily modeled by technology. These are just a few of the features we worked into Sm:)e - we have many more on the way!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sm:)e keeps you smiling by using data to keep your mental health in check. By analyzing the tone of your most recent texts, keeping track of your mood, and promoting auditory and visual relaxation, Sm:)e presents a stunningly simple and beautiful way to be at your mental best.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We extracted texts from the user's phone by using Android Telephony. These texts were concatenated and analyzed using IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer Java API, which returned emotional, writing, and social tones for each set of texts. We then used MPAndroidChart to create radar charts of the aggregated data over different periods of time. Users are able to share their results with their healthcare providers, and directly call Stanford CAPS (Psychological Services) through the app.</p>\n<p>Another facet of our project involved creating a diary of the user's self-reported moods. The interactive survey method allowed users to select a range of different moods from a Pinterest-style menu (RecycleView and CardView, and the results were recorded in a ListView). </p>\n<p>Lastly, we focused on improving the user experience and creating actionables for immediate relief from stress and other mental health related challenges. We used Android's native media player and utilized multi-threaded processes to deliver a meditative auditory experience. This, coupled with animated, soothing images, are designed to deepen the level of relaxation.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Each of us has prior experience with Android, so it was nice to be familiar with the technology beforehand. Most of our challenges came from navigating different git branches and diving deep into the depths of version control. Specifically, with half the team running OS X and half the team running Windows, debugging on the different platforms could be challenging. We also spent a lot of time finding libraries and APIs that fit our use cases the best. </p>\n<p>Another challenging part of the app was to integrate audio playback. We felt that it was important to allow the user to listen to a mediative soundtrack to soothe when in need. However, it was challenging to integrate!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We hope our fascination with data visualization, NLP, and material design techniques shine through. Though this was our first time working with IBM BlueMix (Watson), the MPAndroidChart library, and the Android media player, we were able to dive deep into each of the API/SDKs to complete our vision for Sm:)e. Collaborating successfully with Git was also no small feat - we employed a concurrent work model in which all 4 members worked on separate, sizable portions of the application.</p>\n<p>We are proud of our consistent, aesthetic, and intuitive UI. We feel that a cheerful and seamless user experience is key to Sm:)e's core mission, and worked hard to convey positivity through all aspects of our app.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>After going through the process of finding a meaningful and technically rigorous project for TreeHacks, we learned that having a compelling product vision was crucial to developing a cohesive application. Git became a valuable tool for collaboration, and we were able to familiarize ourselves with the nuances of Android studio. </p>\n<p>Our team developed the ability to easily pick up new APIs and integrate them into Android. We also learned about analyzing and presenting data in a relevant manner.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sm:)e</h2>\n<p>Data analytics beyond just text - integration of email, Facebook, and opt-in diary entries. Building a machine-learning feedback loop by using survey results as the \"gold-standard\" for the NLP analysis. Integrating with physicians and psychologists. Finding more ways to spread happiness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mpandroidchart</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kjlaw/Smile\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kjlaw/Smile\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["PhotoPedia", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxCk4mNM3Q0?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We realize that Google's photo search does not provide content of the photo and Wikipedia does not allow you to use a photo to search for the content.

Imagine the convenience of meeting anyone, from anywhere, and at any time -- all from the comfort of your home or office. Large, popular, and influential events like Google I/O, Grace Hopper, etc. often get sold out before everyone who wants to can purchase a ticket. Our infinitely scalable platform eliminates this problem. We disrupt the constraints of the physical world (space, time), and open up the opportunity for you to connect with your stakeholders and audience in an enhanced reality. We see virtual reality as an elegant solution to not only language barriers, but also the inefficiencies, expenses, and discomforts of physically traveling to interact with others. </p>\n<p>The potential of our project is as scalable as our platform. Virtual reality is not only a solution, it is the future. What\u2019s most exciting is that our platform opens up a new marketplace for businesses around the world to connect, network, and make an impact. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Full conference and live communication in virtual reality from anywhere in the world! In our prototype, we've created a lobby, a webinar room, and a conference room where participants can talk and engage in real time. </p>\n<h1>Significant Problems Addressed:</h1>\n<p>Discriminatory barriers in terms of social, geographic, and financial conditions.\nHigh costs with regard to travel time and conference cost\nLimited participants</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This was a very ambitious project for our team -- especially considering that none of us have worked with VR before. Each and every one of us had to overcome steep learning curves in order to work with multiple different technologies with which we were not familiar.</p>\n<p>Main things we learned:\n-Working with Unity\n-Multiplayer communication and networking\n-3D design for virtual reality</p>\n<h1>Problems we ran into:</h1>\n<p>We ran into a lot of incompatibility problems, as our project involves several different pieces of technology. So we had to think outside the box in order to make our devices compatible.\n-First, our Alienware laptops had an embedded graphic card that is incompatible with the current version of the Oculus runtime. With that, we had to hack our way to downgrade the current run time on our computer, edit some of the registry logs, and disable error reporting in order for the Oculus to be compatible.\n-Finding an ultimate back-end platform for our multiplayer platform and enabling voice so that everyone inside our platform can talk to each other was also a challenge.\n-When we tried to set up the speech to text, text to speech API, our backend platform did not accept sound so we had to convert our audio clip\u2019s 0.5 second frame -&gt; convert to float -&gt; convert to byte -&gt; send it to the rest of the players of the network -&gt; converted back to float -&gt; converted back to sound so there was a little delay when it come to receiving the sound. \n-Setting up the Oculus and getting it to display properly along with the position tracker was extremely challenging.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ConferenceVR</h2>\n<p>Web Interface for corporations, schools, etc. to customize their conference area.\nLive speech translation to allow for language-independent global communication.</p>\n<p>We hope to add in more features such as Facebook authorization, having profile pictures that are parsed from Facebook, population/attendance for data visualization, and much more. There is no end to the number of new features that can be integrated with our platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photon</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-project-oxford\">microsoft-project-oxford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://myo.cloudapp.net/vr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://myo.cloudapp.net/vr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>myo.cloudapp.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sw5813/VRConference\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sw5813/VRConference\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the unity app and used photon to implement multiplayer functionality", "I worked on implementing the leap motion sdk into Unity, troubleshoot so our oculus can be compatible with the computer that we have, and coded our front end website.", "", ""]], ["Note2Note", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Note2Note \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/531/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Missed too many lectures before a test and wanted a better way to make up for lost time.

Welcome to Flagtrip: a flagship collaborative adventure-planning experience.</p>\n<h2>Interface</h2>\n<p>Users of Flagtrip create accounts on our service and plan their vacations in centralized \"Trip\" rooms. These rooms exist in unlisted URLs, and if a User wants to invite a new friend to the Trip, they can add the new friend's email to the Trip, after which a SendGrid operation will send that user an invitation to the Trip. Users can dynamically add and remove location markers on a Google Maps interface specific to the Trip, and flight data, Uber ride estimates, hotels, points-of-interest, and restaurants are displayed conveniently on the map. When the vacation plans are finalized, SendGrid creates an email report of the itinerary and sends it to all participants.</p>\n<h2>Challenges and Accomplishments</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration of Google Maps and Flight data</li>\n<li>Real-time collaboration with many-to-many user/trip mapping</li>\n<li>Uber/transportation solutions with path traversal calculations</li>\n<li>Enumerating database schema for different aspects of vacation travel (logistics to food, location recommendations, etc.)</li>\n<li>Fast, synchronized communication between a Javascript-heavy front end and Ruby on Rails backend</li>\n</ul>\n<p>More pictures are available here: <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/flCWF\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/a/flCWF</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://flagtrip.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://flagtrip.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>flagtrip.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Pic-y Eats", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0M7eW7He_pY?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pic-y Eats \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/403/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Upload </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pic-y Eats \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/420/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Feed (Tea)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pic-y Eats \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/471/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Feed (Soft drinks)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pic-y Eats \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/867/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing Page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Instagram and #food inundates us 24/7 with endless streams of acai bowls and chicken wings. We wanted to \nhave the fun of looking at delicious foods without the nonstop updates (you could say we wanted to have our cake and eat it too), so we came up with a tall order for Pic-y Eats.</p>\n<p>Check in to Pic-y Eats in the morning to see the Food of the Day and the time slot, then spend your day adventuring to snap a picture of the chosen delicacy. Come back again during the time slot, share, and see what others have posted! Share your love for food: upload/talk about your home-made baked cookies, or about the pasta at the new chic restaurant that opened on University Ave. You can see foods from different cultures, different cities, and different countries. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Pic-y Eats (pronounced picky eats!) is a photo webapp that generates a food-related theme of the day, then gives users a randomly selected 2 hour slot to upload photos which fit the theme. </p>\n<p>We also implemented a user authentication system that allows for registered user to log in and view the feed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Flask as our framework, SQLite as our database, and Microsoft Azure as our platform.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p><em>Generating a time slot for daily uploads.</em> \nTo accommodate for the possibility of the web app being unexpectedly terminated, we generated a new time slot for the current day whenever the app is launched. But the time slot had to be reasonable (within 7am to 12pm) for the users' schedules; we couldn't just generate a random timedate instance. What if the app were launched at a time that was _ after _ the generated random slot? We eventually implemented a system to accurately generate time slots, update times when the slot for today has expired, and inform the user of their next available times to post! </p>\n<p><em>Learning Flask and Azure</em>\nWithin 24 hours, we read our very first Flask tutorial, installed necessary files, built a Flask web app, then deployed to Azure! We haven't had much prior experience with HTTPS methods, and that was an interesting challenge as well. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Implementing the user login process was much harder than it looks. We learned to use databases to manage user identities, streamline the process of registration, and accurately check passwords at login.</p>\n<p>After login, it was a challenge figuring out how to keep track of the file after the user selects it, and then serve it back again. Because Flask was totally new to us, there were many nuances associated with it and SQLite that we encountered then conqeured. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>For everyone on our team, it's our first time using Flask and Azure! We learned to integrate HTML with Flask, set up directories for webapps, and deploy using Azure with SQLite. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Pic-y Eats</h2>\n<p>A more robust user login system, as well as the ability to view user profiles and see all the photos and user has posted. We could also crowdsource the theme-generating process, with the next day's theme chosen by popular vote. \nTimezone support would be added as well, because currently the time depends on the Azure servers hosting our webapp.\nOther features include image compression, ability to tag other in your posts, and ability to edit photos before posting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pic-yeats.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pic-yeats.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pic-yeats.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/secant/hourly\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/secant/hourly\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Eventor", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Eventor \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/405/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A fresh interface</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Placeholder</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevinqli/Eventor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kevinqli/Eventor\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Android Application", "Android", "", ""]], ["RandomXKCD", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>RandomXKCD</h1>\n<p>Replace your new tab with a <a href=\"http://xkcd.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">random XKCD comic</a>.

Well for us, as college students we definitely felt that way. Downloading other apps seems also too intrusive. We thought a Chrome extension would be perfect for this.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Procrastinationation tracks your time spent on websites that you probably shouldn't, such as Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The thing that separates Procrastinationation from other time-tracking apps is that it is more accessible and easily visible, because as a Chrome extension every time you open up a new page it will tell you how much time you actually wasted. The app also generate interesting statistics that people will probably enjoy looking at, such as the top 5 visited with a twist: weekly/monthly aggregates of the total time a user spent, and how that compares with their friends.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We split the job into four people. One person was in charge of the user interface, one person was handling all the data analytics, one person was working on the back end of the chrome extension, and one person was working on integration Facebook and the servers. We used node.js for the backend, Cloudant and Bluemix for the servers, jsfiddle for data visualization and Facebook API for the user login. The front end uses HTML and Bootstrap as the framework.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Bluemix was very difficult to set up. We recognized that Bluemix was an interesting tool, but we found it more trouble than it was worth. Chrome extensions have so much security guarding them that it is hard to do things such as make requests from outside servers. We originally wanted to integrate the app with Amazon Alexa, but we had to give it up after finding out that the specific functions that we were trying to accomplish did not match up with the capabilities of the device. It was also impossible to use an Amazon Echo to use, as everybody wanted one and there were only 10 available.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We as a team was able to persevere and work through the entire creation of the app. We spent only 8 hours total as a group sleeping, an average of 2 to 3 hours per person, so we are proud of our dedication and passion for hacking. We learned brand new technologies and applied them practically, which is something that would almost never happen in school. Furthermore, no one in our team had an idea when we first came to TreeHacks, and thanks to the great organizers, we were able to find a cool idea and an amazing team to work with.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Even something small such as a Chrome extension can encounter scope creep if we are unfamiliar with the technology. We originally had more ideas we wanted to integrate, and could have had a more polished app overall. We also realized that while hackathons are fun; coming up with a good idea takes a lot of time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Procrastinationation</h2>\n<p>We had many stretch goals, such as iOS/Android Integration, finding an idea to hack Amazon Alexa, and Splunk real time data tracking.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jsfiddle\">jsfiddle</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/3333qwe/tracker-Chrome-ext\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/3333qwe/tracker-Chrome-ext\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the UI/UX of Procrastinationation", "I did the backend of Procrastinationation", "I worked on the Data Visualization, html, Highcharts API.
