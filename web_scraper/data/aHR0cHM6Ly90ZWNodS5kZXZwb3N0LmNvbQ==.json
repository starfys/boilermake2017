The Rise of the Barber-preneur</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Barbers and hairstylists are increasingly switching to a \"booth rental\" vs. commission-based model in which they  pay a landlord rent for their chairs but do not need to give a commission (usually 50-60%) to the barbershop owner. Booth rental allows for much more autonomy (they can more easily set their own schedules) and much more money: talking to barbers, chair rentals in New York cost the equivalent of 1-2 days of revenue (20% to 40% of revenue). And unlike commission, booth rental is a fixed cost meaning that barbers who generate additional revenue can keep all of it. </li>\n<li>According to trade publication Beauty Store Business Magazine, currently just a little over 50% of barbers use the \"booth rental\" model. They expect this to grow to over 75% in the next 2 years. </li>\n<li>As a whole, the US hair care services industry (including beauty salons) has a  combined annual revenue of over  $20 billion. (US Bureau of Labor Statistics), with 663,000 barbers and hairdressers; expected to grow 13 percent by 2222 (by 83,300).</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Competitive Landscape</h1>\n<p>There's currently no clear market leader, and few if any businesses directly targeting barbers and low cost hairstylists: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Styleseat:  geared towards women; charge stylists to sign up; unfocused &amp; overwhelming for dudes who just want a cut and a shave. Users can book appointments and review stylist portfolios. \n\u2014Shortcut: premium only, starting at $75. They employ the stylists, who are able to come to your home or office on demand.</li>\n<li>Stylebee: Another on demand service that directly employs its own stylists; geared towards women and starting at $50.</li>\n<li>There are also some lightweight scheduling apps such as \u201cGot You In\u201d that are generic calendar/scheduling apps lightly re-skinned to appeal to barbers and hairstylists</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Features and Benefits</h1>\n<p><em>Barbers Can Now Grow Their Businesses With Style</em>\n</p><li>Customizable portfolio. Showcase your work or business with style. Manage your Facebook, Yelp, and other websites in one simple place.; help barbers boost their social media presences</li>\n<li>Predictable revenue and schedule. Set up online booking for free; send automatic appointment confirmations, reminders and thank yous; Curate reviews and gain subscribers who pay upfront?</li>\n<li>Fewer empty seats.  Attract more customers with build word-of-mouth with social media tools. Highlight client recommendations that you control</li>\n<li>Track your client history. store client information and history, along with notes &amp; photos. Manage communications across social networks.</li>\n<li>Not just pen and paper: Payment audit trail/ history; track month over month, net profit, set your own revenue goals</li>\n<p></p>\n<h1>A Better Experience for the End-Consumer</h1>\n<p></p><li>Bad hair cuts be gone! Minimize the risk of trial and error with better reviews and barber portfolios. </li>\n<li>More bang for your buck. Pay Less (with subscriptions); special offers determined by barbers </li>\n<li>No more waiting in line.

We know you hate rounding up to the nearest $10 for tip. Walk in and out without opening your wallet.</li>\n<p></p>\n<h1> Pricing and Revenue </h1>\n<p></p><li>We'd plan to take \"a little off the top\" (5% for all transactions processed through barber. We'd let barbers set their own prices. </li>\n<li>We would make it as easy as possible for barbers to receive recurring revenue and payments upfront (e.g. pre-packaged  5 for $50 deals if customers pay up front that barbers can repurpose in just a minute)</li>\n<li>We'd make it easy for customers to 'subscribe to your barbers' in order to receive discounts (and provide a higher likelihood of recurring revenue for barbers)</li>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many future potential sources of revenue including\n</p><li>Advertising </li>\n<li>Premium features for barbers (better analytics)</li>\n<li>Web design and basic e-commerce ; free personalized salon site to sell retail online; partnerships with major brands like L'Oreal, Matrix and Redken to set up reseller relationships with barbers (taking a ~10% cut)</li>\n<li>Global pass: $20/mo for a special barber experience (e.g. extra hot shave, free product, etc) or even just a package for a couple of hot shaves a month </li>\n<p></p>\n<h1>Revenue</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Jay the Barber (who we interviewed) says booth renting barbers make more money than average </li>\n<li> Therefore it's fair to go with the 75th Percentile for annual walary (but for purposes of this we'll just go with the median to be conservative) http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes395011.htm  </li>\n<li>Median Salary:  $27,710</li>\n<li>Jay says barbers pay on average 20% of the income towards rent </li>\n<li> % to rent:     20% </li>\n<li> Pre-rent Income: $33,252 </li>\n<li>We would take a 5% cut</li>\n<li>Our Revenue Per Barber: $1,663</li>\n<li>According to the US Department of Labor, there are approximately 52,000 barbers and over 600,000 other types of stylists. Using the 52,000 figure, our revenue cap could be $86,621,460 if we were to sweep 100% of the market (realize this is virtually impossible). Still, even if we were to capture 1% of the market, that would be $866,215; 10% would be $8.6M (and this is just from the 5% cut, ignoring any other services).</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/excel\">excel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">invision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://invis.io/2U2E1FS74\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://invis.io/2U2E1FS74\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>invis.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Product vision, business plan and pitch.

We at PEMDAAS have developed a single, unified platform that bridges the gap between the public interest and organizations willing to make change. We aim to empower everyday people with the ability to voice not just their communities' problems, but their solutions in a way that inspires productive and actionable results. We also serve as a resource to Social Enterprises, Corporate Social Responsibility programs, and Government Organizations  by providing targeted, relevant solutions directly from the community. Our platform allows the people to easily submit solutions and upvote great ideas via mobile or web.
