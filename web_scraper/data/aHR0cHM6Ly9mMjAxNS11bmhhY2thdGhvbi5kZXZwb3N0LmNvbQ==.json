Our schools use Scantron machines, which cost at least $6,000 and require extensive manual labor. So, we created ScanSmart, where teachers scan an answer key and digitally compare it to their students' tests by taking pictures of the Scantron.  Additionally, we allow teachers to create accounts where they can organize the data by class periods, with the students' scores appearing there. We initially tried to do this using all front end code with HTML Canvas. However, we discovered that Canvas was extremely slow, and inefficient for going through pictures pixel by pixel. We then used python to compress our Scantron image. To calibrate the scantron, we would have teachers mark in red pen three of the top rows and columns. This enables us to calculate the distance between each answer box. From there, we were able to decrease the time by going from answer block to answer block to check if the box was black. We determined the corresponding letter using the x coordinate of the pixel. Once we had an array containing the answer key, we were able to do the same to the students sheets and compare the arrays.

Somewhere down the line when the business card might actually be useful, its long gone.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Essentially users can register and upload their card once, then share it with anyone they want via a unique ID. The person who receives the card wont lose it and also no more money will be wasted on making hundreds of cards every year. Win-Win for both parties, not to mention the minimization of pollution and saving on natural resources. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Me and my team build it for IOS and Android, hence making it cross-platform. This application uses a backend database as well as a cloud storage facility so after the user initially uploads their card they no longer need to keep the picture on their phone as wasted space. Every card the user gets will also be saved in the cloud.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Image compression is extremely hard to do without losing quality and/or turning the image into a thumbnail instead. We were able to send and receive full pictures which did not compromise quality. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We made the IOS AND Android version along with the whole back-end (DB and Cloud), with a relatively decent GUI within 9 hours. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to deal with gradle problems in Android and solving the image compression problem mentioned above.</p>\n<h2>What's next for bitCard</h2>\n<p>Version 2 will include a whole new set of features for multiple card upload per user and a smoother interface.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Cena-mania 32", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the amount of attention brought to a Nicholas Cage chrome extension.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It replaces text with mostly John Cena quotes, audio, and images on websites.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used javascript to write the features into the chrome extension.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had to understand the concepts of javascript and how they interacted with html5 and the web itself.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we were able to realize our idea and flesh it out.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We realized that learning a new language may not be the easiest thing in the world, but we were able to apply most of the same programming concepts.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cena-mania</h2>\n<p>We will try to embed this feature into windows 10.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bobthepanda/John-Cena-Extension\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bobthepanda/John-Cena-Extension\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was responsible for the conversion of text to John Cena quotes as well as the process of combining all of our work together into one cohesive file.

She devoutly watches her favorite shows, and she loves them. \nArpita loves books and occasionally watching a tv show. \nBoth of them have experience <em>The Urge</em>. \nThe Urge to share... their <strong>EXCITEMENT</strong>. Their <strong>EXCITEMENT</strong> over the book, or show they were reading/watching. The Urge to share, even when those around them cower in fear of the Spoiler Alert or feel a different urge to kill them and make them just <em>shut up</em>. \nSo, together, they aspired to create something that would let them connect with other, fangirls and casual fans alike. That way, they could share the <strong>EXCITEMENT</strong>, in real time, with others just as excited. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FansConnected is a web app for creating and participating in live, real-time conversations on certain topics. If you want to 'fan' with someone about, say,  Sherlock, you can create (or join!) a chat where you can discuss <em>anything</em> you want to about the show, as much as (or as little as) you want, with other fans just as passionate as you. \nOr perhaps you want to virtually watch a show with someone? Well all you have to do is create (or join!) a chat specifying which episode you're watching. And now, you can chat with others as you watch together, and share the <strong>EXCITEMENT</strong>. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Arpita did the backend stuff. \nShe first did a springboard project (magic-of-websockets) in order to learn about servers and clients and multi-person gadgets on web pages. This was using go (aka golang) and javascript.\nThen, she applied everything that she learned (all of which was new!), and started to integrate a chatting aspect into their project. If she has enough time, she's going to further develop the backend code and integrate some python, to make a more polished product. \nNancy did the frontend stuff. \nShe, using HTML/CSS and graphic design, developed the front page, and spiffied up the chat page. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Arpita didn't know anything about go and javascript when she first came. Or the terminal, for that matter. \nSo it was pretty hard to install go (terminal commands! urgh).\nNot to mention the mistakes in the tutorial, which really messed her up. \nBut with the help of the most awesome people ever (aka the mentors), she succeeded. And she did it!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We made this. Wow. We learned go, javascript, terminal, etc. Wow. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Arpita learned _ a lot _. Her coding knowledge, when she came to Unhackathon, was pretty basic. \nBut now, she can say that she is able to run a local server using go, and also use the terminal, go and javascript better, and even python better. \nNancy also learned a ton.
