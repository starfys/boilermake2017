Within just the past 3 years, an estimated 50 million Americans are suffering from malnutrition. They lack not only the income to purchase meals but also the resources to discover where food may be served around them. PantreePal was inspired to put an end to the inhuman, unjust, unacceptable reality that we as a society often overlook.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PantreePal provides numerous user interfaces for individuals to log food inventory. Users [volunteers at a food bank] can either manually create entries through a web or mobile UI, or they can simply take a picture of multiple items through the mobile interface, which will automatically log all the food items in the picture. The web interface provides visual displays of the makeup of the food inventory, which updates in real time as users add and remove from it. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Within the app, when a user takes a picture of a food item, the image is processed using OpenCV and Tesserate. We used the Neumann &amp; Matas algorithm to form our classifiers. The extracted words from the image are sent back to the app so that the user can validate the number and type of items that will be added to the food bank's inventory. </p>\n<p>The backend is primarily Java/Spring/AWS cloud processing with MySQL for the database. The front end is an Android app and web app. HTTP requests are managed using Square's OKHTTP api. The Web app is backed by bootstrap, using bower as a package manager.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Foodbanker</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tesseract\">tesseract</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spring\">spring</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pantreepal.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pantreepal.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pantreepal.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on using OpenCV and Tesseract with the NM algorithm to do image to text recognition.", "I helped get the various subprojects off the ground and worked on the web server/API.", "", "", ""]], ["Tiresias", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CnP2vg6WjNU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Coding for Good: Health and Wellness</h2>\n<p>Over 20 million American adults have some form of vision loss, and the WHO estimates that at least 280 million people are visually impaired worldwide. Currently, most buildings and campuses are not disability-friendly and do not allow for easy navigation for those with vision loss. Assistive devices can call unwanted attention or can be limited to a small range of movement. In addition, these products also rely on the user's intuition or inference and can be less helpful in new environments where the user is not familiar with the layout of the building.</p>\n<h2>Project Tango \u201csees how we see\u201d</h2>\n<p>This Google smartphone/tablet project uses a Point Cloud Library to map a space based on xyz coordinates of each point in the device's range of vision. It has applications in virtual reality, area learning, and indoor wayfinding. </p>\n<h2>Visualizing Unfamiliar Environments</h2>\n<p>Over the course of 20 hours, we created an android app utilizing Project Tango's Point Cloud Library that was able to differentiate between obstacles, walls and corners, and ascending and descending staircases using depth patterns. We designed this app with the visually impaired in mind and used text to speech to give auditory directions to the user to help them navigate new buildings. </p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Using the Point Cloud Library, we created a digital representation of the immediate physical space around the user.\nWe then extracted coordinates from the Point Cloud Buffer and clustered depth readings into different sectors. By analyzing the relative and absolute depth of different sectors, we were able to establish threshold values and algorithms to differentiate between various obstacles and determine the commands that were given (left, right, wall, obstacle, upstairs, downstairs, okay). Voice commands were implemented using Android's Text to Speech. </p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Extracting depth values from Point Cloud Buffer, setting accurate threshold values for different objects, and\nimplementing a \"slope\" threshold for staircases that would set them apart from walls or simpler obstacles.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>Using our application, a blindfolded person was successfully able to navigate staircases and obstacles (see video).\nIn the future, this app could be utilized by the visually-impaired to walk through buildings and receive real-time, predictive, auditory aid without having to rely on other people, animals, or tools. </p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>Apply the app to a smaller device such as an Android smartphone in order to minimize hassle.\nRefine communication from device to user to make the device more subtle, possibly using bluetooth bands to vibrate based on the next steps the user should take.\nImplement location-based services to give directions from room to room within a building that the user has never visited using a combination of satellite GPS and provided floor plans.\nUse area learning to store and refine routes over time if the user revisits the same place for future reference.\nDeal with challenges such as sunlight interference and crowded spaces.\nDesign a practical physical implementation of the app that the user could wear in a hands-free manner.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/project-tango\">project-tango</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Kupoko/Tiresias\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Kupoko/Tiresias\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on developing the algorithms to detect the difference between walls, obstacles, and stairs as well as conducted extensive testing of the app.", "I worked on the backend and the implementation of our API.

At some point or another, we began to discuss the homeless and the adversities they faced. While thinking about how we could tackle the issues of the homeless and low-income, we stumbled upon data showing the low access to food and groceries that many American families faced. For some, not having a car made it difficult for people to go grocery shopping and get food and necessities they might need - especially if they had to work many hours of the day. We decided that we could address this problem with a tool that we used when we needed things from places not immediately available to us on campus - Postmates. The intersection of the two resulted in CrowdNine.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>CrowdNine a web-based crowdsourcing platform, connecting people from low-income areas with people who want to help them out by funding them for individual baskets of groceries and food. Users sign in through Google and Facebook Authentication to maximize security. Donors perform transactions through the Stripe API, and recipients request and receive their baskets through Postmates and the Postmates API. We used Google Geocoder to give local results and options to donors and recipients. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the front end of Crowd Nine using Jade, an HTML template language, and used JavaScript to get data from the site to the Node.js server. The server communicates with MongoDB to store basket data, including all of the items in it, and the total price. When users find baskets to donate to, they simply pay with a credit card through the Stripe API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We faced many challenges along the way in the creation of this project, as none of us had ever worked with Jade, MongoDB, and we had very little to no experience in JavaScript. Most of our problems occurred with learning these new technologies and making the API calls despite the adversity, however our most challenging problem was making the final connection between the variables stored locally client-side and the database.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting the stack to work in the first place was a huge achievement, considering we had never done it before. After getting something running, we started tackling the different API calls, and were able to successfully get data from all of the ones we tried. While it seems relatively simple, some members of our group have struggled to deal with this portion of the development cycle beforehand, making our success even more incredible. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Before this project, we really didn't have much experience working with Javascript or any of the related libraries or environments. So, building CrowdNine served as an incredible learning experience, as we figured out how to create a novel application in a short period of time while familiarizing ourselves with the technology. We also found ourselves greatly enjoying creating an application that can actually have a significant impact on the world. In the end, the most important thing that we learned was that, we can make a difference, and this motivated us more than ever before.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CrowdNine</h2>\n<p>We hope to build the CrowdNine platform to be more robust and be able to handle a significant amount of users. Furthermore, we hope to increase the amount of products that we can offer low-income families beyond basic groceries and necessities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mean\">mean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stripe\">stripe</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postmates\">postmates</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-authentication\">google-web-authentication</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chaityabshah/CrowdNine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chaityabshah/CrowdNine\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I mainly worked on the UI, graphics, and building the frontend of the application.", "", "", ""]], ["Ecodiversity", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ecodiversity \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/769/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Ecodiversity</h2>\n<p>Biodiversity is a key indicator of the environmental health of an area.

Spaced Repetition Software (SRS) have made tremendous progress in making learning more efficient, but there's still a lot of work to be done. If Memrise says that you need to water your memories in 14 hours, most people won't actually review them on time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FlashCardKitties is an immersive learning experience. Whenever its learning algorithm detects you're about to forget a memory item, the Pebble Smartwatch it's running on will fire a quick vibration, and present the user with a vocab word and definition. The user then self-evaluates how well he or she knew the answer, and that information is sent to the server at flashcardkitties.com.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built an WatchApp for the Pebble that functions a lot like a WatchFace. The goal is to be unobtrusive while still providing very useful functionality that will help them learn better. In this case, less it more, as constant alerts and vibrations can get annoying. The UI Elements on the watch are controlled by code written in C. Some JavaScript running on the mobile phone connected to the watch interacts with the C code to provide access to networking. The website allows the user to register with Facebook to add vocab words to their account on FlashCardKittens. The settings section of the Pebble App allows the user to view their vocab words they've stored through the web interface, which uses a PHP backend to store the vocab in a MySql database.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Pebble documentation is ehh, imho. There were a lot of different aspects of the project to work on, and we were a small team of two.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I created a functioning web interface to a smartwatch app!

This lack of quantifiability places an even greater burden on doctors, who need to efficiently and confidently determine where a child falls on the ADHD spectrum in order to get them the help they need.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By creating a virtual environment where children are given a task and doctors are given the means to control distractions, the child can be directly evaluated by their doctor and, by assigning them a score based on how well they accomplished the task despite the distractions, the result is a value that can be compared to other patients.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We made a classroom environment in Unity and animated 3D models of paper planes and crumpled paper balls that will enter the viewer's field of vision and potentially distract them from counting the letters that appear on the board at the front of the classroom. We used Java to code a program for doctors to input numerical values for how many distractions there were, how many letters the patient recorded correctly, and how many letters they were given. This yields a score that will believe will be significantly different for those who do and do not suffer from ADHD.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our group had minimal experience working Unity, so we had initial difficulties, particularly with looping animations, but we eventually this figured out. We also had a bit of trouble user-input animation triggering and the directions our added walls were facing (e.g. inverted, backward-facing; looked pretty funny).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of learning Unity and setting up the Oculus Rift. It was incredibly exciting to work in virtual reality with such amazing technology.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned an entirely new program and developed a finished product that does what we set out to do.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ADHDev</h2>\n<p>We need to test out our Hack with a pool of patients who have been diagnosed with ADHD and those who have not in order to determine base scores and set up a scale to compare. We would like to add more distractions of different types, such as birds flying past the window, a steadily ticking clock, and gradual changes in lighting in addition to our current spontaneous distractions, and we would like to integrate sound.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3ds-max\">3ds-max</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["VitalTimes", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VitalTimes \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/770/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VitalTimes \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/754/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Long lines anywhere can be a frustrating experience, but they can be a life-threatening one in the emergency room.  Even with the use of triage, a minority of hospitals meet recommended wait times for admitting patients to their emergency departments and fewer than half of hospitals consistently admit patients within 6 hours.  This is a situation with poor outcomes for everyone.  Patients do not expediently receive treatment and the quality of that treatment drops when hospital staff are inundated with a demand that they cannot meet.  For this very reason many hospitals publish live ER waiting times, but this information is often scattered across many different websites.  In emergencies, inconvenient access to information might as well be no access at all.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>To solve this problem, we designed VitalTimes, a service that conveniently directs patients to hospitals with the smallest combined wait time and drive time from their current locations.  We also direct patients to urgent care facilities, which can handle lower priority cases that might normally clog up lines at the ER.  This way, patients can quickly and easily identify which facilities to choose without having to look up them up information.  The total time to treatment is conveniently displayed on a side bar right next to the map.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We identified databases with accurate ER and urgent care live waiting times. We then wrote python scripts to scrape these websites and parse the data.  This data was then pushed onto Firebase, which served as our back-end.  We then utilized a variety of Google APIs\u2014including Maps, Places, and Distance Matrix\u2014to build an interactive map that displays hospitals near patients, ranked with a sorting algorithm based on total expected time from their current location to an emergency or urgent care facility.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenges involved understanding the transition from assignments in the classroom, which often rely on sample data made specifically for the purpose of the homework, to utilizing live, dynamic, data samples often built for a completely different purpose. The challenge is in learning how to best integrate and consolidate all the available resources, varying from new languages and frameworks to novel APIs, that best suit our goal. </p>\n<p>In our case, this specifically involved learning how to use a variety of python libraries to scrape data and integrate this with the Firebase API. We then utilized Google APIs to parse this data and display it in an interactive and easy to understand format for the user. The main challenge was learning how to consolidate these various resources. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The first moment when we saw the interactive map populated with actual, live ER waiting data was a very rewarding experience. Being challenged to learn and pick up so many new frameworks and resources helped develop our abilities as not only coders but also as problem solvers. We chose to work within the Health and Wellness track so that we could ensure that our product would make a tangible improvement in people's lives. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Python to scrape websites and use XPath database querying commands to extract key information.  We also learned how to work with a variety of APIs and tie them all together.  Finally, we learned how to divide work and accomplish goals under stress and time constraints.</p>\n<h2>What's next for VitalTimes</h2>\n<p>While what we currently have is a proof of concept, we hope to continue expanding our project.  We will work to accrue more live wait time data from emergency and urgent care facilities in order to ease hospital traffic and improve patient outcomes across the country.  We also recognize that VitalTimes is more effective as part of a larger navigation tool.  We hope to partner with an existing navigation service, allowing VitalTimes to become more convenient for the average person to access and use.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kbyatnal/ERMaps\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kbyatnal/ERMaps\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["sCANvenger", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sCANvenger \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/965/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sCANvenger \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/705/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sCANvenger \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/706/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Recycling cans is a huge source of income for many people that displaced or homeless; they might make up to $70 in a single day.  However, looking for cans and can-dense areas can be challenging, especially for some that are more physically disabled, thus making them less efficient.  In addition, upon receiving their payment, many homeless people will spend their money unwisely, not considering a long term plan.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>To assist our friends, we built sCANvenger that does two things:</p>\n<p>1) It generates predictive models of aluminum can concentrations, depicted as a heatmap.  We can guide users to areas that have the most cans, and with the least amount of pickers.\n2) The ecosystem also automatically deposits into a Capital One bank account, created for pickers using our system for the first time.  Depositing and withdrawing money comes with advice to encourage smart spending.</p>\n<p>We envision our application being primarily used in two locations, respective to the functionalities described above:</p>\n<p>1) By placing a large screen monitor in a homeless shelter, we hope that having a source of information that optimizes their day and income flow will also encourage seeking out shelter as opposed to living on the streets.</p>\n<p>2) We hope to create a partnership with recycling centers, which would have a way to access our recycling center/picker portals, which allow for depositing their income into secure bank accounts as well as providing information about their money flow.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>As it is hard to build such a system without adding a lot infrastructure (e.g. smart trash cans) to keep track of number of aluminum cans in different areas, we take advantage of other accessible data sources such as population density, supermarket distributions, and household distributions. With the power of HTML5's geo-location, we are able to locate the device's current geological location. By mining data from heterogeneous data sources and using statistical inferences based on demographic models, we are able to infer the density of aluminum cans over an specific area as well as the amount of money a picker can make in that area per hour.</p>\n<p>We then used Capital One's Nessie API to facilitate bank transactions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Drink And D-Rive", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, ONE in FIVE accidents are caused due to drowsy and drunk driving. This is a preventable problem, and we wanted to look for a better way to tackle drowsy driving.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A driver, upon entering her/his car, is asked to speak out a few sentences to the Raspberry Pi mounted on the dashboard. The device (with the support from an Arduino) analyzes the input voice, and determines if the driver is fit to drive. If she/he is not fit to drive, the tool dispatches text messages to close family members/friends alerting them of the driver's location, following which they may take action.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our tool uses the Speech-To-Text IBM Watson Service to generate a JSON representation of the input speaker's voice. We then parse the JSON in Python and analyze the following things:</p>\n<p>a) Time differences between words spoken, and calculate the average of these time differences. If the average is larger than a threshold value, we trigger a flag.</p>\n<p>b) Analyze the time taken to enunciate long words (we use the example word 'encyclopedia') and compare it to the average expected enunciation time.</p>\n<p>c) Analyze the time taken to enunciate certain phonetics (we use the phonetic sound 'ch' in 'chose') based on scientific evidence that certain phonetic sounds take longer time to enunciate when intoxicated.</p>\n<p>d) Analyze the rate of enunciation of the 26 letters of the English Alphabet. The tool returns a warning flag if average time between characters, and the average time enunciating each character is above a specified threshold value.</p>\n<p>All these four tests are based on scientific research conducted on this topic.

Every time we visit one, there is a requirement of filling out all the details , basic repetitive details like name, date of birth, blood group and emergency contact etc. So we were inspired to create an application which would help the patients and not require them to fill these details every time. This would be particularly helpful for patients coming to the emergency room.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>So the patients and the doctors both are registered to the app. Whenever the patient visits the hospital or the doctor, the doctor or the hospital just sends a push notification to the patient with the message \"send details\". When the patient registers for the app, he/she can fill in the information which gets saved in the phone as a json file. So when the patient receives the notification from the doctor, the patient sends the message back with all the information from the json file as a Json string and the doctor has an interface which automatically gets filled by all the information received from the patient. This ensures easy autofill of information and no wastage of time for the patients or the doctor</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Google Cloud Messaging with Android to accomplish the task of interaction between the doctor or the hospital and the patients. We also used json as the data format , so the data passed from the patient is passed as a json object and we parse this data at the doctor's end to extract the necessary field information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating Google Cloud Messaging with Android. It requires configuration, consistent wifi connection since we are hosting it on a local server for the demo.Running a local server like Tomcat and interpreting what messages are being exchanged in between the patient and the doctor.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Successfully integrating the Google Cloud messaging with Android app. This avoids the need for the patient and the doctor to be in close proximity and avoids the use of bluetooth or any other such methods of interaction which requires proximity. Successfully building the prototype of the main application which accomplishes the main concept and the functionality with certain limitations.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our Group consisted of variety of people with little to some knowledge of Android. We successfully learnt how to build an android application from scratch to integrating google apis like google cloud messaging with Android. Also learnt a good deal about Json parsing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for QuickFill</h2>\n<p>The QuickFill is a quickfill app which can be not only used in the medical field , but can be enhanced to be used in any field which requires immediate communication between any two parties and requires automatic filling of information</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud-messaging\">google-cloud-messaging</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tomcat\">tomcat</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\" https://github.com/prashantgupta24/HackDuke_WebServer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" https://github.com/prashantgupta24/HackDuke_WebServer\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"    https://github.com/prashantgupta24/HackDuke_QuickFillApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"    https://github.com/prashantgupta24/HackDuke_QuickFillApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/djain2405/HackDuke_Client\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/djain2405/HackDuke_Client\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["TroubleTimer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Beginner's story: Coming to Hack Duke, I really didn't have any experience coding.

Upon doing some research, we learned that those with intellectual disabilities learn best by breaking down tasks into small steps, performing hands-on tasks, by being in environments where visual aids are used, and by being provided direct and immediate feedback. These teaching methods gave us the idea for the super interactive game- \"LeapAhead\".</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app allows parents to sit down with their kids and help them with simple problems. The parent will read aloud the question and the child will point, using the Leap Motion sensor, to which ever answer he/she thinks is correct. If the child answers correctly, the parent will click the next button and go to the next question.</p>\n<p>We take the hand coordinates provided by the Leap Motion tracker and constantly stream it to the front end in order to map the hand to a general position on the screen.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We sued AngularJS to create a front end web app that connected to the Leap Motion sensor. We used the Leap Motion JS plugins in order to stream the live position data tot he front end side of the app. We then took that data and made events based off of where the user's hand most recent position.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The backend sub team dealt with challenges involving the Leap Motion sensor. The open source code had a few errors such as providing the wrong number of detected fingers (we were initially planning to have the child user point) and did not have the most precise sensing. Due to this, we decided to have the user move their hand in the general direction of the correct answer as it calls for less precision. The backend team also had difficulty connecting to a server to stream the X and Y coordinates of the hand to the front end team via WebSocket so we went about that in a different way. Initially, we wanted to have the child hover their hand in a particular spot for x amount of time (and then provide a visual sticker congratulating the child for selecting the right answer), but due to time constraints we simplified that function.</p>\n<p>The fronted team had some trouble finding the appropriate framework and understanding data binding under the hood.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>how we worked so well under pressure with stuff we hadn't ever really used before and still managed to realize our vision. We were even trying to set up Oculus at one point but maybe that was too ambitious.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Firebase, connecting backend to frontend, new technologies on the spot</p>\n<h2>What's next for Leap Ahead</h2>\n<p>We would allow the child to select the correct answer using the Leap Motion sensor. Right now, the parent must click the next button to go onto the next question. Also if a child is selecting the wrong answer continuously we could give them a hint to the right answer.r We could also provide characters that the children are more familiar with. For example if we asked a question about colors and one selection was the color yellow, we could use Spongebob as the answer choice instead of a plain yellow block. This allows children to map familiarity with new concepts. We could develop a reward/achievement system that would allow the children to see their progress. Adding profiles for children could create a more personalized experience for them as well- perhaps even adding a personalized greeting and encouraging phrases/quotes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pure.css</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/travis-ci\">travis-ci</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nagadeepakc/LeapAhead.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nagadeepakc/LeapAhead.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked with the front end by implementing an AngularJS application that communicated with Firebase on the backend.", "", "", ""]], ["Flow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/511/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flow \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/521/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flow \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/522/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flow \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/538/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We realized as college students that half the battle during our education is learning how to use our timely. While the internet has been great with helping us find all the knowledge we need to learn a subject, it's also filled with distractions that keep us from actually utilizing that knowledge. This is why we created an extension that holds us accountable for our procrastination.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Before starting a homework assignment (a research paper about volcanoes for example), we'd click on the Flow icon in Chrome, type in the research topic we have to work on (volcanoes), and then click Start Flow. From this point on, the extension runs a acquires synonymous words and relevant topics for \"volcanoes\" and comparing the words with the ones found on all the webpages visited from the time we Start Flow to the time we click End Flow. If the percentage of words found on the page that are equal to the words acquired from our topic is low, it means we are not on a productive part of the web and we are notified to get back on track.The comparison between the words and the time spent gives us a data visualization of our productivity over the period of time we were on the web. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Google's Chrome extension documentation in javascript for the back end. The front end uses html, css, and javascript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It was challenging trying to get the Flow extension to continue comparing words when a new tab opens so that one wouldn't have to restart the extension any time a new url was visited.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This was our first time doing a web application like this and building a Chrome extension. It went so well, that it encourages us to make other Chrome extensions to tailor our web browsing needs.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Lots of javascript. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Flow</h2>\n<p>With what can be gathered in this extension,  we can begin to implement a series of rewards for good productivity and penalties for poor productivity.  If productivity reaches a certain low point,  it will notify you locally reminding you to get back on task.  We have begun looking into implementing monetary incentives.  For example,  if it is linked to your bank account,  once your productivity has been low for too long,  a dollar will be transferred from your account into a charity. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Flow2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Flow2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Flow2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Flow2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["front end (html, css, javascript)\ngraphic design (photoshop)\nData visualization", "", "", ""]], ["Tango Vision", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y9hCZKVPpgQ?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tango Vision \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/732/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  20.6 million Americans 18 and older reported vision loss.\n  Vision problems are among the top 10 disabilities as reported by the American Foundation for the Blind.\n\n Worldwide, the World Health Organization estimate 285 million people are visually impaired.\n\n  Think about the family or friends close to you with visual impairment.

The process of checking up on these apps seem so automated today. We felt it was about time to add some more value to trendy social media, an outlet for people to vent, share, and learn about the news going around their community on a local and global level. This also solves the problem of many people not being able to plow through thickly worded news articles created by professionals, it makes news accessible and effortless.</h2>\n<h2>What it does - Allows people to submit a summary or opinion of an arbitrary news event of choice.

It is common for someone to travel 20miles to a nearby bank or third-party depositor. Given this, we sought to create a grid-independent ATM (giATM) that allows one to deposit his income and enjoy a full range of mobile banking services. </p>\n<h2>How is it different from current ATMs?</h2>\n<p>ATMs of today often require extensive land lines and high speed VPNs, which are not available in some parts of developing countries. </p>\n<h2>What it does/How it works</h2>\n<p>Consumer deposits money and inserts identifying token into giATM. The giATM has a simple currency counter similar to those in vending machine. The token provides an Unique User ID (UUID), a token ID and an encryption key. The giATM also generates a timestamp at time of transaction. The giATM uses the encryption key to display a pseudorandom string with all the other information to the customer. The customer will text the pseudorandom bit to the bank via SMS. The bank server upon receiving the pseudorandom bit will use the corresponding decryption key (based on the token ID) to decrypt the message. The bank will issue the respective amount into savings account of consumer.</p>\n<h2>What's next for giATM - Banking for all</h2>\n<p>This can be scaled up easily given its low costs. Our goal is to provide a low-cost and robust device for banks to utilise and expand their presence in developing countries. We also recognise the use of grid-independent technology and this could be extended to provide an array of other services.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://still-scrubland-1100.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://still-scrubland-1100.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>still-scrubland-1100.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Feline Fix", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Feline Fix \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/786/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>The point is to show the off our team's ability to stick together and deliver in the midst of adversity!

He clearly remembered how every school there hoped for a basic computer lab that school could use to teach the students more about the world. Such goal already existed for quite a few years and none of the schools there was unable to find any used computers. However, our teammate knows that several firms from Jinan, China, his hometown, have a great amount of out-dated computers. From then on, these firms have been donating computers for the schools in Ol Pejeta. Yet there are countless amount of such goods, not limited to computers, that mean nothing in the developed regions but could change the lifestyles of people living in underdeveloped regions.

For health, we considered problems ranging from ER wait time to health issue awareness to mental health monitoring. For promoting charity, we were thinking about sites like change.org, kickstarter, freerice.com, and Tab for a Cause and what made them successful. We started focusing on ways to make charity accessible, community-oriented, fun, and low-commitment.</p>\n<p>Drawing from both lines of thought, we came up with Share the Gains, a web-app for promoting an active lifestyle while raising money for charities.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Often times, family members or friends might create fitness goals for each other and agree on a reward for achieving the fitness goal (e.g. if we eat healthier and stick with going to the gym for a month, we'll go on a weekend vacation or splurge on a new pair of shoes). Coworker, churches, and other communities also often have weight loss competitions where the person who loses the most weight in one month receives a gift card.</p>\n<p>Share the Gains takes this idea of friends and family incentivizing fitness for each other and applies it to promoting charities. Share the Gains allows anyone with a Facebook account to sign up and send fitness challenges to their friends and families (i.e. facebook friends). Each challenge request has an associated fitness goal such as achieving a mile time under 8 minutes or running for half an hour a day for a month. Each challenge request also associated \"reward,\" a small monetary award that the user who made the challenge agrees to donate to a selected charity if the challenge recipients completes the fitness goal. Share the Gains is integrated with Pebble smartwatches, and the completion of fitness goals is determined based on data taken from the Pebble. Each user provides credit card information upon registration, and donations are sent to the charity from the challenger once the challenge is complete. Share the Gains is a social web-app, and it includes a dashboard with a newfeed and records of ongoing and past challenges. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The web-app was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Login is done through an embedded Facebook login, and backend in taken care of using Parse. The payment system was achieved using the Stripe API.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Share the Gains</h2>\n<p>Ideas for functionalities to add in the future include: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bi-directional challenge requests (you can challenge another person to do a fitness goal or you can ask someone to donate if you complete a fitness goa)</li>\n<li>Mutual challenge requests (you set a mutual goal with a friend if you each donate if the other achieves the goal)</li>\n<li>Integration with PayPal</li>\n<li>Integration with facebook newsfeed</li>\n<li>In addition to a newsfeed, having profiles for each user -- profiles would include records of challenges, fitness goals, and donations</li>\n<li>As of now, we are only able to accommodate fitness goal that are based on running, which can be easily measured with Pebble.

It is easier to motivate oneself when one can follow lessons that others can take. LearningPaths offer pathways for people to find lessons and goals to motivate themselves. With the potential to include several, community-driven lesson plans, LearningPaths provide a great educational experience for everyone. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>LearningPaths aggregates links and resources for people who took the time to study the material in their own lives. Through sharing resources such as blogposts or YouTube videos, others would be able to follow in the footsteps of those who followed these videos. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This app was built using the Android sdk and Android Studio(Java). The backend server was originally made using Heroku and Python, but it was transitioned toward Firebase. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Heroku and Python were fairly unreliable, and the original plan was a lot more complex in scope. A lot of features were either cut out, streamlined, or implemented very poorly compared to the original vision for the app. Material Design was also very difficult to implement. Firebase also did not offer easy ways to access data once it was placed on their servers. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>With limited technical experience and resources(a thinkpad from 2007...), we were able to implement a social experience using Android and the web. This was huge, especially for us, since we haven't worked with JSON, XML, RESTful, or the Android SDK before. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about creating backend servers and databases. For the future, it will be important to consider the tools available to implement an application based on scale. I would be more open to using tools like Heroku and Amazon AWS for more robust web application. I would also like to work with more hardware. </p>\n<h2>What's next for LearningPaths</h2>\n<p>After fixing major stability issues and testing on android, we would plan on a few key improvements: \nFirstly: we would take the Firebase backend and replace it with something more robust. A new backend would allow for the app to scale better and to include more features, such as a web or iOS client. \nSecond: It would be great if we were to implement the \"Share\" features found in Android. Being able to share a video or a webpage directly from Chrome or Youtube to a Path would allow for greater ease of use.\nFinally, it would be important to aim for a cohesive visual language across the application, from the iconography to the animations and user interface. Our current icon looks like something from a video game... not cool. It would also be nice to include social network integration and elements of gamification to help people learn even more. </p>\n<p>With more time, this idea would have been something that I personally would have used every day. However, a social experience like this is always determined by the strength of its community. I am confident that this would have made education more accessible and fun for everyone. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2TRi7SfHPfwTjRISXRZemRBNzQ/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2TRi7SfHPfwTjRISXRZemRBNzQ/view?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped set-up the server and database.

The story goes that the world produces enough food to feed every single person on Earth but there is still a billion people in the world experiencing starvation or malnutrition. Where did the extra food go? Most of them are actually wasted in developed countries. Managing leftovers have always been a challenge due to the high food safety standards imposed and the problem of location mismatch between the people who need the food and where the leftovers are. We are here to change that by offering a different approach to it by highlighting the demand of the food to the people who prepare it. But before we change the world, we want to change Duke's campus first.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FoodForDayz is a demand-management app that allows students to notify the college canteen if they do not plan to dine in the college canteen. A lot of food is wasted by marketplace every day simply because they cannot anticipate how many students plan to eat there and marketplace always end up cooking too much food. We want to create an app that will eventually be integrated with DukeMobile that allows students to indicate to marketplace in advance that they might not be going to eat at marketplace on certain days. In return, students will be offered some credits or FoodPoints that they can use to purchase food elsewhere on campus. From marketplace's perspective, they have a better idea on how much food to prepare for the day. From the user's perspective, they can get some money back for instances where they have to travel or dine out of campus.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our team utilized xCode to develop the app on the iOS platform first and we plan to expand it to Android at the later time. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Importing the API into xCode took us a long time to figure out and just coding using xCode was tough since all of the members of our team were first time Hackathon participants and we had elementary levels of computer science knowledge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were excited to build our first iOS app, although it is not fully functional yet because of the limited time we have to code during HackDuke. We are also proud of our idea because there isn't such an app on the market or on any campuses yet and we believe that this can be a disruptive idea. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to work with fellow coders on idea synthesis, conceptualization of an app, physically building the app using xCode, seeking help from mentors and finally integrating our code to form the final product. </p>\n<h2>What's next for FoodForDayz</h2>\n<p>We hope to develop it further beyond the span of HackDuke and make it fully functional for the good of Duke students.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ptan35/FoodForDayz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ptan35/FoodForDayz\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["", "", ""], ["", "", ""], ["vLibrary", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"vLibrary \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/512/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"vLibrary \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/513/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"vLibrary \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/514/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"vLibrary \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/515/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To read a book all you require is an interest. The need to spend on books actually acts a roadblock in the learning curve. The community with people who are ready to share their collection of books can help in taking education to a next level.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>vLibrary is a virtual library which has users who can add all the resources they are willing to share. Every user can filter their search for books based on location,title, author. Once they find the book of interest they can request for the book from the owner. Choosing a book closest to the borrower will enable easier lending and returning. This way people can share the books which they are not currently using. Education will no longer be considered with economy as a limiting factor.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used javascript as the base-development language, Bootstrap for the front-end design, esri for maps, firebase for storage and facebook for authentication and user profile management.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We are using firebase, which did not have the feature of full text search. As we did not have time to develop elastic search, we ended up using regular expression matching which is inefficient </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We deployed the application already and it is available online.\nThe feel of working for a cause gives more accomplishment than any other applications we have worked so far.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt firebase and we learnt how to deploy and work in a live application</p>\n<h2>What's next for vLibrary</h2>\n<p>This could be made into a mobile application although the current web application is mobile-friendly.\nBased on the usage frequency or privacy, people can drop and pick the books from nearby libraries instead of handling the transactions in person</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hackerpack.me/vLibrary/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hackerpack.me/vLibrary/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackerpack.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HackerPack/vLibrary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HackerPack/vLibrary\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["", "", ""], ["Facebook Posts Analysis", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of crappy posts on Facebook.
