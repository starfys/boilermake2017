We decided that this was a feature that could greatly improve Facebook's already existing API. By combining these technologies, we were able to create an efficient and effective tool to help users easily locate old pictures and relive good times.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Reminisc is an application that brings up a user's history of photos in an easy to use and visually appealing web application. The user can filter the pictures based on people tagged, the captions of the images, and tags created by the Clarifai API.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first worked on implementing an API that interfaces with the Facebook Graph API, and Clarifai's picture tagging service, and condenses this information for consumption by a single page Angular.js application. After completing this original benchmark, we focused on extending our product into mobile devices and created an iOS application that made use of our previously created API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some of our original plans for hosting the web application online fell through early on, and we had to quickly decide how to make our product public. In creating the actual application, we did not really run into many issues until we started developing the iOS application. We developed it using the Ionic Framework to make use of our team's previous experience with Angular.js and web development. However, it was not straightforward and required a little bit of experimenting.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully harnessed the power of Facebook's Graph API and were able to use it with Clarifai to make a product that we feel greatly extends Facebook's existing feature set. We were also able to quickly create fully functional web AND mobile applications in the same weekend, surprising our entire team.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We gained a great deal of experience in Angular.js and learned how to use the Ionic framework to our advantage to quickly develop stable mobile apps.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://reminisc.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://reminisc.org/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>reminisc.org</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ec2-52-23-241-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ec2-52-23-241-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ec2-52-23-241-139.compute-1.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thomasquinn/reminisc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/thomasquinn/reminisc\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Feeder", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Feeder</h2>\n<h3><strong>The Problem</strong></h3>\n<p>Twitter is suffering from content overload.

She then decided to make an application where there would be a useful and efficient way for students to share notes for free. Once we heard her idea we decided to work with her on developing the app.</p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>NoteUp is an efficient app where college students can upload and redeem notes. How it works is that a student posts his/her notes on NoteUp. Fellow students would redeem the notes with a token. However, for a student to receive tokens, they must post notes that are liked by students. We will have admins supervise for quality. This way we can avoid those who posts bad notes to receive tokens. Then with the tokens acquired the student can redeem the notes they missed for class. Each day of notes would be worth tokens, and this would encourage students to not miss class continuously. Overall, this app would be a great resource for students who missed class due to an emergency or miss understood information the teacher said. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>To built this app we used XCode which is an IDE that uses the swift programming language. We also used as resource Stack Overflow and the condensed version of the swift manual in order to implement some of the functionality and debug some of the errors while creating the app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The challenges while building this app were many. At times we faced compiler run-time errors that took an hour or two to find and fix. Second was the swift programming language itself, because none of the members were fluent with the syntax and all the basics of the language.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we can bring an app which is very simple to use and with a functionality that would help college students improve their grade and learning skills. In due time this app will become the best repository for custom notes. This is because our notes are specific to the professor you are an student of. This will greatly impact your grade because many professors use the same material covered in class when they prepare their exams. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the value of being patient in order to get things to work. We also learned that no app ever gets done without sacrificing sleep especially at a Hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NoteUp</h2>\n<p>NoteUp will be scaled so that every University has it's own functional copy of the software. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fernmndez/HackFSU-NoteUp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fernmndez/HackFSU-NoteUp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Designed back end, including the API application uses to function, and implemented the functionality of the iOS Application", "", "", ""]], ["How Much How Many", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/335/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>income and bills populated</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/336/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>view/add incomes or bills</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/337/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Adding a bill</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/338/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Splash Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/339/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Side menu</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/340/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Adding an income</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/341/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The About page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/342/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample main page after resources is populated</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/343/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample main page after resources is populated</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"How Much How Many \u2013 screenshot 10\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/344/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Early form of what our idea was and is for the app.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: There was no budgeting app like the one we were looking for and wanted to solve this problem.</h2>\n<h2>What it does: You plug in your income as well as any fixed bills and the app will tell you how much money you can spend on other things without overdrafting your account or worrying about paying your bills. The app takes in your income, subtracts any bills for that pay period and returns the \"Extra Money\". As a comical feature, we included the ability to have the app tell you what various food items you can by with your extra money.</h2>\n<h2>How we built it: We used Illustrator and Photoshop for the graphic designing and Komodo, Cloud9, and sublime for our IDE's. We also used the Ionic framework and angular.js framework. We originally gave a rough draft on Moqups.com and then began our first version on pure HTML and CSS. From there we moved on to Ionic/Angular for the javascript where our project was finished with.</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into: The first four ideas that we had already started, we found out while we were building them that they already existed and had to turn to something else. Once we bean working on How Much How Many, we found out during the brainstorming stage that a lot of math and algorithms would have to be implemented and had to find a way to make this app work without such complexity because our allotted amount of time. We also had one member of our group give up the first day so we had to carry on the extra weight of one less person on our team.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of: Greatly improved knowledge of Illustrator and photoshop as well as HTML,CSS, and Javascript.

This holds true not just for physical security, but for cyber security as well. All of your emails and text messages rely on strong encryption to keep your information safe, and that's why we still possess at least some notion of privacy.</p>\n<p>At the heart of strong encryption is the ability to generate random numbers.  Unfortunately, the random number generators software developers typically use are purely deterministic -- once the generator has been seeded, all future values are fixed until the next seed. On a desktop, high-entropy data typically comes from a combination of time, mouse movement, and network data. That type of high-entropy seeding is strikingly lacking when it comes to mobile devices. If a malicious entity is able to collect a sufficient amount of generated numbers, they can predict all of the future random numbers generated by your phone. (The crux of it's encryption technology!)  A successful attacker would be able to predict your keys, and read all of your messages.  </p>\n<p>The best way around these potential security vulnerabilities is to use a True Random Number Generator (TRNG), which uses hardware to generate numbers, as opposed to a Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG), which uses software.  By relying on a high-entropy physical process instead of deterministic software, a TRNG's results are completely unpredictable.  While some specialized devices are equipped with a TRNG, the vast majority of our devices -- for instance, our cell phones -- rely on inferior PRNGs.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Rando Shot First is able to quickly generate large amounts of truly random data by extracting the noise out of several photographs taken on an iPhone.  We employ an algorithm that computes a one-way transform over the the RGB values of a number of photos' pixels and other methods for \"harvesting\" the entropy from several pixels. The original picture is completely destroyed, leaving only random noise due to both sensor imprecision and physical randomness.  Each set of pictures are able to generate approximately 10,000 truly random bits.  We ran several randomness benchmarks over the data such as the Wald\u2013Wolfowitz runs test, which confirmed that our bitmaps have high degrees of randomness.</p>\n<p>After completing its scan, the app itself displays a bitmap representation of the random bits generated as well as a sample 64 bit random integer.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Swift and Xcode to create the iOS app, grabbing raw, uncompressed images from the camera sensors.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>When we initially ran the app, we only used one picture to generate our random numbers. However, regions of the image with low entropy, such places as by light sources, created large sections of white patterns in the resulting bitmap, not the random behavior we anticipated.  In order to solve this, we have the user take several photos in different positions.  All regions of high entropy are superposed and combine to form a highly random bitmap.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it took a while to figure out how to have the camera interact with our app and read pixels from the camera since both Swift and the APIs we needed to use have changed quite a bit over the past couple years. It was difficult finding current example code to reference.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The end result is smooth and streamlined.  It works consistently with a fluid, easy-to-use interface, and it provides an interesting solution to a problem many people don't usually think about.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Over the course of this project, we learned a good bit about random number generation, Swift, and Xcode. I feel a lot more comfortable working with iOS design as well.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rando Shot First</h2>\n<p>Implementation of a messaging client that uses the random numbers for public key encryption.  Additionally now that we've published our open source code, any number of other applications could implement this random number generation algorithm.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cal2u/Rando-Shot-First\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cal2u/Rando-Shot-First\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["iWorkoutNow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"iWorkoutNow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/848/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"iWorkoutNow \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/847/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"iWorkoutNow \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/849/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"iWorkoutNow \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/347/850/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I am building this for my senior research project and originally an idea I had with my roommate to help us keep track of our lifts.

It is build to be easily updated from a week-to-week basis. </p>\n<p>It was built using some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript in-conjunction with SoundCloud's API. This proved to be a challenge to the team mostly because the team was consisted of <strong>TWO AWESOME PEOPLE</strong> who <em>may or may not</em> have had little to no programming experience before this hackathon, so we ended up teaching ourselves how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as how to integrate an API into a website. We are pretty proud of what we made and we are confident that it is going to basically take over the internet and make us millionaires. If any updates are to come we would want to integrate our own login system to enable ourselves to track our community's interest and more efficiently choose playlists that are <em>outside</em> of their comfort-zone or just past their musical outreach.

Celebrities use them to boost their followers, others use them to make their lives easier, and some just use them for personal entertainment or gain. Bots are not accessible to the common person that doesn't know how to code. There may be a lot of tutorials online but for the average person, they may not be able to dedicate the time or effort towards bot creation. With <strong>TweetyBot</strong>, they do not need to dedicate their time to a struggle on making their own bot when <strong>TweetyBot</strong> automates the process for them.</p>\n<h2><strong>What it does:</strong></h2>\n<p>Users create a twitter account or use an existing one for the app. Users can then select what actions the bot can take and watch these actions unfold in the BotStream. Users can continuously update the bot or give it new actions through our app. Actions include searching for specific keywords, replying to keywords, creating a tweet, replying to direct messages, etc. This all occurs on the user's mobile phone.</p>\n<h2><strong>How I built it:</strong></h2>\n<p>We used Android studio and used a Twitter Kit, a KitGroup consisting of TwitterCore, TweetUi, TweetComposer, and Digits.</p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges I ran into:</strong></h2>\n<p>Since we are inexperienced with Android Studio, preferences were a difficult obstacles that we sadly could not overcome in time. Additionally, we used the Twitter API for the first time which we had to figure out how to incorporate properly using Java since the API is better used with other languages. A buggy interface also made development difficult.</p>\n<h2><strong>Accomplishments that I'm proud of:</strong></h2>\n<p>We have minimal experience with Android Studio. We wanted to learn more about Android mobile apps, front-end, and back-end development. We managed to successsfully implement some Twitter functions into our program as well as having a solid plan for how we wanted the program to look and feel to the user. Although the program does not currently provide all of the functions we intended, we know that once we surpass our challenges, <strong>TweetyBot</strong> will work as intended.</p>\n<h2><strong>What I learned:</strong></h2>\n<p>We learned more about Android Studio, XML files, Twitter API, and generating a plan for our application.</p>\n<h2><strong>What's next for TweetyBot:</strong></h2>\n<p>TweetyBot will be properly completed and function as intended.

Our work will also helped those who are unable to send text messages, the ability to do so with simple gestures. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MorseSMS allows one to use hand gestures to type in morse code using the myo armband. During this process one is also given suggestions to improve the speed of the message typing while hearing every word added. The user then has the ability to send the text as SMS.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The program is written in Javascript, and is run on Node.js. We also implement the express framework and the Socket.IO library. To use the armband, we use the myo package found on npm. With the use of ResponsiveVoiceJS we included Text to Speech for every word added. Lastly, we implemented the Bing and Twilio APIs. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was our lack of experience with Node.js and the frameworks we used. The Myo Armband can also be inconsistent with how it reads gestures, sometimes it is very sensitive and sometimes you have to make a lot of movement before it can read your input. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We got most of our work done about 6 hours before submission. First hackathon that we did where we actually completed the hack. First hardware hack. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a great deal about Javascript in general but especially for Node.js and Socket.io. </p>\n<h2>What's next for MorseSMS</h2>\n<p>Better word suggesting, two armbands at once, death ray. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">text-speech</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gestures</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/castjosem/MorseSMS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/castjosem/MorseSMS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Turnt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Turnt \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/415/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login in with Facebook</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Turnt \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/416/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Map of current friends' events </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Turnt \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/414/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Set your \"turnt level\" from 1-10</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Turnt \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/413/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Add your own event to the map for others to join!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Drinking margs and wanting to turn up but no one to turn up with... </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Let's you find friends in your area that want to turn up.

The cat enjoys being pet, but only up to a certain point. Pet too much, or not enough, and the game is lost. However, if you are able to keep the cat happily satisfied for a certain period of time, you win!</p>\n<h2>How did you split the work?</h2>\n<p>Our four members walked into this hack-a-thon with no prior experience with Android Studio or creating android apps. As such, the learning process and subsequent creation was spread equally amongst all of us. To add extra personality, one of our members, Michelle Tzou, hand drew the cat and background of the game.</p>\n<h2>What difficulties did you encounter?</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we dealt with was our lack of experience. The learning curve for this process was steep, but with hard work, perseverance, and a significant amount of free sugar and caffeine we were able to overcome the challenge.</p>\n<h2>What was biggest accomplishment about your project?</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, the biggest accomplishment for us is having a finished product we can all be proud of at the end of our first hack-a-thon. </p>\n<h2>What did you learn from the experience?</h2>\n<p>As a group, we learned both from personal experience and help from our amazing mentors about many of the various pitfalls that developers can come across, including correcting cyclical architecture, to dealing with Java's memory constraints.</p>\n<h2>What are the next steps for Pet Pets?</h2>\n<p>The next natural step for this game is the addition of several other stages. More types of animals to pet as well as upgrades to the existing cat were all ideas we were throwing around. We are really excited to introduce diversity to this app as well as play around with the objectives for every differing animal. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["pitchPy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>MATLAB and DSP are lit, so I tried to implement frequency manipulation in a more user-friendly environment</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Plays different notes for you and then allows you to record yourself, telling you how on-pitch you are</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Python script;

Also, most people when they wake up the first thing they do is 1) Check their phone or even just browse on it or 2) Drink a cup of coffee to get them up and going). We wanted to make it possible for people to \"Wake Cup\" with a sense of enjoyment and fun and this could be done by receiving snap videos and other incoming media from your friends as an alarm. Also, we all tend to forget the things we need to do because we are all busy, so we developed a way to get social interactive reminders to stay on task.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>Wake Cup!</em> allows it's users to essentially set alarms / task for themselves. Once this is done, they are now open to receive \"Wake Cups\" from any of their friends who are willing to send. These \"Wake Cups\" have no boundaries and the user sending the \"Wake Cups\" can have as much fun with it as they want. Now, you can wake up with instant entertainment and people will be a little more willing to waking up. However, <em>Wake Cup!</em> is not just limited to user's receiving only \"Good Morning\" snaps, but also snaps to remind them on whatever daily task they put as the description when they set their alarm. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built <em>Wake Cup!</em> as an iOS app using Swift. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many obstacles, but the one that stunted us the most was not knowing how to implement sending video snaps. Also, we had to figure out how to implement an alarm clock for the app, but we eventually got it figured out.\nCouldn't get the free domain to work, but oh well.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We all did a good job and in the long run we did the best we could to develop <em>Wake Cup!</em> We had fun creating it and my team is full of cool people. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Wake Cup!</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the design aspects and created the idea and conceptualizations.

This is what is used to determine the next picture that will show.  It then goes back to the original companion page seamlessly.  The desktop page is constantly refreshing itself, automatically receiving the new picture when it is changed.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<p><a href=\"andrewpendegast.com/dab\" rel=\"nofollow\">Remote Link</a>\n<a href=\"andrewpendergast/dab/drake\" rel=\"nofollow\">Viewer Link</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://andrewpendergast.com/dab/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://andrewpendergast.com/dab/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>andrewpendergast.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://andrewpendergast.com/dab/drake\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://andrewpendergast.com/dab/drake\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>andrewpendergast.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Renegrades.com", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Renegrades.com \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/257/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Renegrades.com Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The FSU course search leaves a lot to be desired.

We then read from this file and display the results using our PHP webpages.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We found a similar project that we liked and had the functionality we wanted. We then read through it to find out how it worked and modified a few things like the login protocol in order to get into the FSU course catalog. After hours and hours of reading through code and debugging problem after problem, we got it to output the way we wanted it to. The next step was getting it to play nice with a webpage that one of our team members had already built. After some serious tinkering and debugging, we finally got everything working the way we needed it to.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge was just reading through the very long and complex code we used as a template in order to fully understand how it worked and how the files interacted with each other. After that, we spent quite a while just trying to figure out how to get our code to properly log into the FSU portal and navigate to the course catalog. The next part was just ironing out bug after bug that ranged from improperly coded libraries to obscure dependencies to getting it to play nice with the web framework and everything in between. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Honestly, we're proud of the whole thing. We're proud that we made the it through the entire Hackathon, we're proud we managed to iron out as many bugs as we did and tackle problems as complex as we did.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a tremendous amount about debugging. We had various mentors debug in various ways and it was really just about learning to get into the right mentality.

We are all relatively new to the Hackathon community and we realize how important it is to have things like Hack Competition and just general interest in learning new skills that is in all facets of our lives today. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This application is supposed to use the other users on the service who want to study a specific language to get together with other users and getting a little more knowledgeable about something new. It is supposed to help people get ready for the next future Hackathons' and never have to study alone for it. Hopefully, it can even get new people interested in grouping up!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our though process going into the application was to create something very technical with tons of information and really advanced geolocating features to make it more easier for people to find each other and learn more through the service, but then we decided to make it more a social media and study based application.\nWe built the application in Ionic Framework with Angular.js. There was also a lot of use of HTML and CSS on the overall build of the project. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were multiple issues from the beginning that really hindered progress, but one of the biggest ones had to be changing midway the competition from React/React Native to Angular/Ionic. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to change ideas a little past halfway mark as well because we found out that another team had appropriated our idea for theirs. It was definitely a bit disheartening, but we pushed through and changed our idea to something a little bit different, but still with much of the same concepts. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.github.com/junilovi/iOS.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.github.com/junilovi/iOS.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end of our app, creating the log-in page, and other aspects of our app.", "I worked on the Angular usage of this app and trying to implement the Firebase backend server as well as graphic design control", "I worked on the design and user interactions, striving to have a creative design as well as help capture the mood of our target audience.", ""]], ["CoolerTalk", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CoolerTalk \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/225/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The new post page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CoolerTalk \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/226/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our side-menu</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CoolerTalk \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/227/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The comments page for a specific post</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CoolerTalk \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/228/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our about page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CoolerTalk \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/229/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our main page that displays the posts</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration Our graphical designer, Annabelle, came up with the idea.

Users also have the capability to sign up for an account then they can log in and out of the app.</h2>\n<h2>How I built it We used the ionic framework which uses cordova in order to make cross-platform apps while programming with HTML, JS (particularly AngularJS), and CSS. In order to save the posts that the users post, we used firebase which worked very well with the ionic framework and AngularJS.</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into At times, it was difficult to focus only on the front-end because of how heavily connected some pages were to the data being passed to it. Because of this, the way I had to shape the pages was based on the way our data was passed, but the converse of that was also true.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of I'm proud of the fact that my team was able to work so well together. We all have pretty different backgrounds and are relatively inexperienced, but we used our skills to improve the app. My focus was the front-end of the website so I dealt mainly with the HTML and CSS, but I had to help out with some of the more complicated JS because it took a combination of us to solve some problems. Lester and Kerlin worked on the backend and made it function as well as it did. Annabelle produced all of the great graphics seen in the app. It was particularly impressive since 3/4 of our team were at our first hackathon. The other person, Kerlin, had only been to one before, where he worked on a game programmed in Java so it was very different.</h2>\n<h2>What I learned I learned a lot about mobile-app development, especially cross-platform development, AngularJS, and how hackathons work.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for CoolerTalk__HackFSU We hope to add some more features before releasing it to the Apple App Store and for android users.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lramo062/CoolerTalk__HackFSU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lramo062/CoolerTalk__HackFSU\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Backend", "", "", ""]], ["MunchFree ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Bring FSU student, who are financially restricted, the luxury of free food.

Meetings, schedules, physical endurance, and mental exhaustion all come rushing forward like a raging sea. Five more minutes...and then you take the first pivotal step\u2014the dress for today.</p>\n<p>BlueJacket helps you make that first step by helping you select the best fashions of tomorrow. Take in the torrent of magazines, social media, and interests from the global web and envelope it to your personal self by searching similar items in the web to you shelf or selecting from other BlueJacket users portfolios. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>BlueJacket works by suggesting fashion styles based on user input to show either similar outfits on the web or by other BlueJacket users. The aim is to provide worthwhile fashion advice to people within a socially conversive environment that is local, meaningful, and a valuable experience.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ExpressJS</a> for the fundamental templating of the web app. We all learned it here at HackFSU in the workshop for it, and it provided a wonderful experience for both veterans and beginners to the Node Javascript runtime. </p>\n<p>Once templating the beginning web app was completed, the html for each page was refactored and made to our standards. We also used the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/developer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram developer API</a> to gather information and pictures using <a href=\"http://instafeedjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instafeed.js</a>.</p>\n<p>We also created assets for the web app using Adobe Illustrator and used <a href=\"https://coolors.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coolors</a> for our color palette. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the major challenges was the integration of Instagram's API, as it had recently changed to offer new features and security. Now, Instagram's API works to sandbox applications, so we can no longer get public content, but access to sandbox users. (Correct us if we're wrong :) )</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating the logo for Blue Jacket was an enlightening experience, and it looks very professional thanks to the Design Workshop at HackFSU.</p>\n<p>Using ExpressJS for the first time was truly a gift. We didn't know it was such a powerful tool in creating APIs and hope to experiment with it in the future.</p>\n<p>Building a very nice looking website brought morale up in those wee early hours in the morning. It was really amazing to see the frontend come to life.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Aside from ExpressJS, html, css, and designing for all of us, we learned the dynamics of building a web app and the possibilities for expansion with new technologies.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BlueJacket</h2>\n<p>We'd like to implement a lot more function to our frontend. Creating a database for the web search function to find fashions would be the best thing to do and integrating Instagram's API with it. </p>\n<p>Separating the user submitted base and creating a backend for the user base will also be part of BlueJacket's future. We certainly want to build an app too, probably using the <a href=\"http://ionicframework.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ionic Framework</a> that we were introduced to here at HackFSU.</p>\n<p>Until then, check out the Github and the website! Thanks!</p>\n<p>P.S. Why the name BlueJacket? One of the group members was suggesting the idea for the app when she said the word \"blue jacket\". One of the other group members thought it was a good name and liked it a lot...almost too much.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sheer-will</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">red-bull</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sugar</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">no-sleep</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CodeFluent/BlueJacket\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CodeFluent/BlueJacket\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Do I Qualify?

A mobile application is able to scan the environment for the specific frequency at which the buzzers ring and will then send text messages to family and friends previously listed. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>At first we attempted to use the Intel Edison, however it did not seem the device was compatible with any of the available computers, so there went our chance to implement bluetooth and/or wifi functionality along with other things in our hack. However, with every challenge there was an opportunity to come up with something new and from this grew our plan to use an app to detect the frequency at which the buzzers were sounding to send alerts to a pre-populated list of phone numbers. . </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of completing a functional device while learning and implementing different technologies. For all of us it was the first time developing an android application and while we did not fully finish the application we sure got a head start and learned different methods of implementing and mobile application. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As a group we all learned different skills, some of us learned to use an arduino and implement buzzers and different chips with it. Others learned how to implement meteor.js and an ionic framework. Most importantly we all learned how to work with Android Studio to start developing a mobile application</p>\n<h2>What's next for LifeSaver</h2>\n<p>The next steps for our hardware hack prototype would be to obviously decrease the amount of space it takes. Ideally we would also like to incorporate it onto or mobile app through bluetooth or wifi functionality to avoid draining battery through constantly having the microphone listening for the specific frequency. In the near future we would also like to send GPS coordinates through the device of where an accident happened and hopefully make the device completely independent from a mobile application by adding a GSM module. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/accelerometer\">accelerometer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">buzzers</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["GTFO (Get the Flight Out)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Since the beginning of time (aka the start of our college years), we have been indecisive about our travel plans. Where to go? When to go? How do we get there? Finally, we decided that this spring break, we wanted to go somewhere, anywhere, and spend the least amount of money possible getting there. And thus, at our first hackathon (for 3 of our 4 members), we created GTFO (get the flight out).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>GTFO allows the user to input the airport they would like to fly out from, and the date they would like to leave. GTFO works its magic and gives the user the 5 cheapest flights out of the chosen city on that day. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our gorgeous web design was due to the Mapbox API, and we were able to get flight data from the Expedia hackathon API (though it is inaccurate). Overall, we built it through a combination of creative JavaScript, HTML/CSS use and some interesting data parsing techniques.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a lot of challenges trying to get the data from the Expedia hackathon API. Because it wasn't well documented, and because we are so new to hackathons, or even building web apps in general, we had a lot of trouble figuring out how to use it. We ended up being able to ask some friends and mentors for help, and were able to keep moving. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to say that we were able to finish what we'd started. Though it's far from perfect, it was nice being able to say that we finished something front to back (with the back only being partially hard-coded).</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We were able to successfully learn how to use a few more APIs and teach ourselves HTML/CSS and JavaScript using the docs and with a lot of help from stackoverflow.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GTFO (Get the Flight Out)</h2>\n<p>We hope to be able to finish this webapp soon, preferably when we're all better rested, since we did get quite close. We would like to expand this service to international fights as well. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lsurasani/GTFO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lsurasani/GTFO\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Respond", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ES_gkmIJyE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Respond \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/197/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Respond \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/198/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Respond \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/199/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>After a recent episode of fits, where one of our team member experience the vulnerabilities of a human being, he decide to help enable a personal support network for times of emergency. Our main target are people who are at risk of heart attack, crime and terrorist attacks. </p>\n<p>With over 1.5 million Americans suffering from heart attack each year, 60% of them do not seek help until it was too late for them. We want to allow these people to be able to seek immediate help from the people around them like their children, co-worker, spouse, secretary, etc. With timely intervention, we can save many lives that might be lost. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Response is a one tap application. In a single tap, our application will count down 10 seconds before it alerts all your emergency contact of your situation through a phone call. If you have the luxury of another two taps, you can narrow down the context for the type of emergency you are in and help solicit more informed assistance from your loved ones. </p>\n<p>Response reach out to your support network in many ways. It primarily sends them a customised phone call but the user may add additional features. It can also send these messages to the user social profiles such as Facebook and twitter.</p>\n<p>In situation like acute heart attack in the office, posting it to your social network may save your life when your co-worker picked up the message and come for your rescue. Other use cases for our app includes terrorist attack, natural disaster, stalker, armed conflict, </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team is split into the visual, front-end application development and back-end server development. For front-end ios application, we used a mix of xcode and Appcelerator to complete both app on phone and on iWatch. For back-end server application, we made use of loopback.io built on express.js. It allows us to spin up the application API as quickly as we need. We have also used Twilio API to make emergency phone calls and IFTTT to implement the social features. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Although we are developing ios apps, we do not have sufficient Mac laptops. This results in the bottleneck. Additionally, one of the machine was running a older version of xcode and os, resulting in a loss of a few hours as well wait for the os to upgrade. We also encounter several technical issue with iWatch as we have no previous encounter or experience with it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This hackathon is the first for 3 out of 4 of us. We are mostly proud of our first step. As for the application, we are proud to have an app with sleek design, simple usage and unlimited possibility. The API server we have allows others to build on top of what we have done and pave way for more possibilities. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Time management\nPhotoshop\nObjective

Sean had an Arduino Uno, a small chassis, motors, and various sensors. We really wanted to make use of the various sensors, including some photo-sensitive resistors. We started programming the robot to recognize the level of light in the room, and behave differently according to the relative dark or light it sensed. As we were programming we started to ask ourselves, what reacts differently in a light room than it does in a dark one? Well, a roach does. So that's when we got the idea. We could use our robot to emulate a roach. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The robot we built is designed to emulate a roach. It scurries around in the light, turning left and right at random until it finds a dark place to stay. As it's scurrying randomly about the room, the bot will turn to avoid collisions with any objects 10 cm in front of it. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>All of the coding and control of the robot was done using an Arduino Uno. We had a small kit of robotic parts including the two motors, wheels, chassis, photo-sensitive resistors, a motion sensor, LEDs, speakers, and various other electronic components. We assembled all of the parts, then went to Arduino Playground for examples of code usage and access to various libraries. We would basically pull one of the sensors out of the box, Google a pin guide and some example code, then try to run it. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the hardest parts with hardware coding is connecting everything properly. Lose connections or mis-connections can be very difficult to diagnose. One of our initial problems using the photo-sensitive resistor was that it didn't seem to be responding to light differences. We changed resistors and ran the code multiple times in different ways, but it still didn't respond. We finally realized when looking at a pin diagram that we connected the resistor to a digital pin instead of an analog one, which it needed. We were also one off on all of our pins for the motion-sensor and it took us a while to discover why it was malfunctioning. </p>\n<p>We also struggled with some of the timing requirements of the code. For some portions of the code we implemented delays so that it would fully execute before moving on to the next task. The problem here is that when a delay is implemented, the robot is basically on standby; it is completely unresponsive to the environment around it. We eliminated as many delays as we could, but some were still necessary to dictate the flow of code. Researching the problem we discovered the use of the millis function. The millis function tracks the current time since the initialization of the program. Using a couple extra variables to store values and operate delays in increments of the millis, we switched all of our major delays over to timers. </p>\n<p>A major timing issue we had at the end of our project was an apparent stall in hiding mode. We spent several hours troubleshooting the code and trying to track down the delay. After implementing the millis function and eliminating all major delays, there was no apparent cause for this delay. We checked all of our connections and traced back through old versions of code, but were still puzzled by the way the robot was executing the code. On some occasions the robot stopped running completely. At this stage we had just finished integrating all of the various components of the project, and so the code had grown very complex. All of the components worked individually, and we checked all of the connections multiple times, so we were truly lost as to what may be causing the delay. Thanks to one of the mentors we managed to trace the problem to sound file that wasn't working. The best mentor, by the way! Thanks so much!! Even though no sound was actually emitted, the small delays for each note compiled into a noticeable delay in hiding mode. We removed this sound file from the final project code.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>For three of the four of us, this was our first hackathon. We came into Dirac with little idea what we wanted to do, and only basic coding experience. We ended up taking the Arduino board and robot kit and making a very integrated design out of it. A lot of our ideas were scattered, so I'm very proud that they all came together so well into the final project. I think it smoothly integrates the usage off all the different sensors into an elegantly simple concept.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>While working on the project we learned the basics of hardware coding with Arduino. I think we troubleshooted through some of the most common errors in hardware coding, so we will definitely know how to avoid those in the future. Working with each other definitely proved helpful. It showed us that it's always useful to have someone else to troubleshoot through your code with you. They can provide a different perspective, and maybe think of or notice something you wouldn't have. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Blue Roach</h2>\n<p>For us this project was a very valuable learning experience. We had a lot of fun putting this robot together. We're definitely looking forward to doing more hackathons in the future, especially hackFSU. We'll see you guys next year! :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">arduino-uno</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Masterpiece Mystery", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Masterpiece Mystery \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/066/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Two set of functions</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I absolutely love role play games!!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a text game where you are a detective and solving a case, so you make choices.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used python.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I never used python before or ever coded.
