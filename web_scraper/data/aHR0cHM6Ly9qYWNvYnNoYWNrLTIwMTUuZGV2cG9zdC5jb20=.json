Using an estimote node to connect with tessel micro-controller to gather the signal data, and then we process it on the back-end interface which is then presented on a map to find your nearst available toilet. \nWe ran accross multiple technical diffuclties on the hardware side. Initially the tessel micro-controller API didn't work. And later, we ran accross trouble unlocking the estimote node due to the fact that the estimote server's been down. So this is the reason we couldn't utilize the full functionnalites of the estimote and therefor a signal processing method was\nadopted.\nWe used normal distribution models to classify whether the node is moving or not approximating the two classes with two gaussians comparing their standard deviations. So when the toilet door is opened the signal is gonna fluctuate. This is in turn going to flatten out that gaussian while the other gaussian will just stay quite narrow.\nYou can also purchase toilet rolls on our site from our sponsor company toilet inc. using the braintree API.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lypnol/Toilet-time\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lypnol/Toilet-time\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.challengehack.com/hack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.challengehack.com/hack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.challengehack.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Portalman", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Portalman \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/462/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>A browser game mixing bomberman and portal.

Especially red-green-blind people are facing a huge challenge in our society: Red is used as the color to express importance (warnings on packages, etc.), to attract attention (fire trucks, fire extinguishers, etc.). Green on the other hand occurs naturally in all sorts of places, is used a lot for packaging (Sprite, ...), and so on.</p>\n<p>Our goal was to build a tool bringing back the \"sticking out\"-experience of the red color to color-blind people.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Basically, it takes a video of a scene as input (e.g. taken with a mobile phone), processes it by letting red areas flash brightly. To support our development process, especially to have an idea how our post-processing looks like to color-blind people, we also added filters to simulate two kinds of color-blindness.\nLater we also added a feature trying to detect dangerous situations the person running the app might run into (like accidents) - in production the app would issue an emergency call or similar in such situation.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML5 and WebRTC to build the apps as stand-alone web applications that run on most devices and platforms.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Not having done anything with WebRTC before, it was challenging to accomplish video processing using nothing but HTML and JavaScript. After that, we encountered problems like figuring out how to detect potential dangerous situations as reliable as possible. \nAt another point, we struggled utilizing the compasses built into our mobile devices - as all of where very unreliable, contradicted each other or sometimes changed their mind spontaneously without even being moved. All in all they turned out to be a bad tool to determine a users orientation reliably.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are quite proud to have created something that might provide color-blind people with some of the extra information most people of our society enjoy every day. It was a huge experience to work on a subject like this and think hard about the problems visually impaired people deal with.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about the theory behind the different types of color-blindness and similar conditions. We learned how to use very recent HTML5 technologies to our advantage.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ColorfulMind</h2>\n<p>We thought a lot about the way people can use our app and we are aware that carrying around a mobile device all the time is not practical and can actually be dangerous. On the other hand, this would be a perfect app for augmented reality glasses like HoloLens (unfortunately, nothing similar was provided to us during the event). We would love to develop and run our app on a wearable device.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript\">typescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webrtc\">webrtc</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/npm\">npm</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/olydis/JAssist\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/olydis/JAssist\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Damir and I split up the work equally as we were both interested in the same parts of the projects.

And whenever a plug is needed, none can be found. Airports, shopping malls, shops, they all might have public sockets which nobody knows of (an undiscovered gold mine).</p>\n<h2>What _ UndiVolt _ does?</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> When you start the app, you can directly see a map of the nearest sockets. In addition to this interactive map, everybody can also report new sockets and rank other sockets. We will create world's largest socket map or better said: the world will create its own map of public sockets thourg crowdsourcing. Based on user rating, the map will be kept updated even when sockets malfunction or no longer exist because repeated bad rankings will cause the socket to be deleted.\n\n That is only a part of UndiVolt. What happens if you forget your charger? In this case, the app allows you to search for all nearby users who are willing to lend a particular charger. Those users will receive a pushNotification and if they accept it, the locations will be exchanged and a the helper and one in need will be able to chat throug the app. It's Tinder for chargers :-)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>We rolled up our sleeves, proudly powered through the NodeJS server functionality with support for Plug discovery and rating, user identification and 1 to 1 user chat. Then we put our pride and enthusiasm in Swift development. Sadly, the cruel world and, maybe, the tiredness kicked in. Only half of the planned functionality was successfully implemented.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>We chose to develop with iOS' Swift for the first time. None of us had any previous experience with it so it proved to be very difficult to advance at a quick pace. We spent 1 hour on 2 for loops and 4 Strings to extract a char from a string...yep, it's that bad. \n</code></pre>\n<p>Initially we wanted to use Google Maps but it has issues with iOS 9, so we went to Apple MapKit. </p>\n<p>But the biggest challenge was the full-stack nature of our project, employing both a server and an app client.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Basically, we managed to build an iOS app, in a language we never used before, in just 24 hours, which communicates with a server we built. Even if we only finished half of the functionality we wanted, and just 10% of the design, it's still nice :-).  \n</code></pre>\n<h2>What we have learned</h2>\n<p>The force is weak with the Swift. </p>\n<h2>What's next for UndiVolt</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> A lot of optimisation would follow, in order to make it a steady system. The backend is quite done, but needs to be much more secure. The app requires more design and the rest of the functionality. \n</code></pre>\n<p>We do plan to launch it on the AppStore in the following weeks, if we get a free hosting for long enough :-)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iFlex/JacobsHackRobotzi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/iFlex/JacobsHackRobotzi\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["CrimeWatch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CrimeWatch \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/362/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CrimeWatch \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/414/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CrimeWatch \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/415/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CrimeWatch \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/503/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CrimeWatch \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/504/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CrimeWatch \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/505/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Used Braintree API in this project for donations on the website.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Shia\" data-canonical-url=\"http://assets6.pop-buzz.com/2015/22/shia-labeouf-patriotic-motivational-1433169378-responsive-large-0.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--VOONrEYb--/http://assets6.pop-buzz.com/2015/22/shia-labeouf-patriotic-motivational-1433169378-responsive-large-0.png\"/></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Keeps you informed about the crimes in your neighborhood.

The data was in .csv format and sadly, it was not divided between columns, so every row was a very long string with lots of information in it. We had to parse it using regular expressions and built a work around, so that we could easily normalize this data. The project itself was a serious challenge for 4 students, that just began their second year at the university. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>My team and I are proud, that we were able to create a multiplatform solution in a matter of 24 hours. We divided our team and in pairs tackled various tasks from various angles, so that at the end we were able to focus together on creating a simple API for our multiplatform solution.</p>\n<h2>What we have learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned, that even the most ambitious projects are not impossible. Thanks to the developers from the sponsoring companies, we have learned alot about problems, that we could run into, if we would go with our approach. Thanks to this knowledge and long discussions, we have learned about new concepts and new ways of thinking when it comes to designing databases, software and solutions.

The only similarity is the aim of the game - \"Avoid the BOMB!\". Minesweeper has it's rule of placing the bombs and after learning that sequence, everything depends only on your speed. Minesweeper - 2 is based to improve your logic and can be played against another person as well.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Since I've started programming only one month ago, the only weapon I have is basic of C language.

I'm sure you know how I feel.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>My major is Electrical and Computer Engineering. I chose it before coming to university. Here, I wrote my first program in C language - \"Hello World\" :). I wasn't interested in programming before coming here, because I've never tried to. Programming is really cool and I was thinking to major in Computer Science, but I wasn't sure until now. This event made the final push in my making decision. \nEvent was also useful to complement my knowledge. I've learned more small details in programming in C and also something about graphics mode.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Minesweeper - 2</h2>\n<p>I made the game with the simplest rules and in worst way it could be done (text mode). But that's enough to convey the idea. I'm sure this game can be improved, so that this game can become as interesting and useful as chess.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c-language</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Temirlan97/Minesweeper-2.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Temirlan97/Minesweeper-2.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Shut up and take my money!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shut up and take my money!

As I arrived there, I looked all over the class, and my friend, Frasineanu, wasn't there!... Fast forward 6 hours later, a sad guy, with wet hair, and raspy voice asked me for a cigarette. It was my friend. Apparently, he overslept because the phone didn't wake him up. But then I thought - we can make calls to our landline phones in our rooms! They will call you, and call you, until you answer. If you answer, you will get a math question to wake you up. Thus, the solution was found.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a server to call your room at any desired hours, insist if you don't answer and also ask you questions. Also, the user will be able to delete/add alarms. This is useful iff the landline phone is away from the bed.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Go because of it's simplicity with concurrent functions (goroutines). The HTTP server communicates with the SIP client-server. Thus, we can add logged users (using our campus' campusnet credentials/api) into a list, check their token, add calls to a list. Also, it implements XML reading and writing into a file in case the SIP client-server crashes. \nThe SIP server will also send to the client (jWakeup) DTMF tones which will represent the answer given by the called person.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Securing go-channels,  writing cookies (I still have to figure out what I have been doing wrong), actually reading some RFC files from top to bottom to learn some protocols, debugging UDP traffic.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Writing something extensive in a such period of time - multitasking, server communication, learning protocols.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>To prepare extensively before any task, and the fact that the start is one of the most important elements.\nAlso, to get technical - SIP protocol, SDP protocol, RTP, DTMF tones, how to properly use gochannels, basic website structure.</p>\n<h2>What's next for jWakeup</h2>\n<p>Actually make it work. I will make it a service available in our campus, which will actually call our rooms (SIPp was used for server emulating), with question-asking, and answering.\nPeople to whom we've talked were very happy about the idea, and many agreed that they would like to see it implemented in the campus.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sip</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dmitescu/jwakeup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dmitescu/jwakeup\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Server implementation in go", "I worked on the front end and helped with the back end.

We were inspired to do something similar to determine what factors we could find to help a fledgling business decide where to setup it's workspace.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Launchpad is designed to help 2 types of entrepreneurs: those setting up a restaurant and those who are establishing a tech start-up. The entrepreneur uses the web-app to select what type of business he/she is starting and picks which of the available parameters that we selected he/she would like to use. We then generate heat maps illustrating the data sets and a combined result. The user can then visually identify which area looks promising.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using the Django framework with a python back-end. Used YELP, and Google API . BrainTree's API also</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The main difficulty we had was locating appropriate data sets. While some were readily available and easy to use such as the Yelp API they had limitations such as a cap on query results meaning it was difficult to get city wide data.

We utilise the excitement that a little friendly competition brings and provide a ranking of explorers , keeping track of their achievements.</p>\n<p>We came together as a group of individuals with different skill sets and now deliver this fantastic app as a team of four. Each of us brought their share of talents to the table, and together we created something that none of us could have done alone. \nWe decided that the web is the perfect delivery mechanism to approach as broad an audience as possible, without restrictions for different devices, and were fascinated by the possibilities that HTML5 offers to developers of mobile applications. Some of us know Python really well and develop the server backend with the django web framework, while others drew the graphical elements, and developed the frontend with AngularJS and HTML5.</p>\n<p>It was important for us to make it as easy as possible for take part in adventures and challenges, so we decided to use an registration mechanism that most people are familiar with: a Facebook account. It turned out to be challenging to integrate the authentication mechanism quickly, and a considerable amount of time was spent on this.</p>\n<p>We established a test driven development workflow very early on, which was a great for both stability of the application and the fun that we had during the development. We also worked with the Travis continuous integration platform and the coveralls coverage reporter on github. Good structure and one command deployments made it possible to move very quickly, implementing features that we initially thought optional.</p>\n<p>Tonight, we learned how to work in a cross functional team under time pressure, we learned how to rapidly prototype ideas and communicate our ideas to our team. We learned a lot about the possibilities of HTML5 and also gained some more insights into the inner workings of python libraries like social-auth and django. </p>\n<p>To make a PlaceVentura an attractive platform, we think it is of utmost importance to quickly enable users to create new Quests for others, because the best challenges are put up by explorers themselves. We would like this idea to spread to more cities, to bring more gamers from the couches into nature.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">svg</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vagrant</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">travis</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://placeventura.rocks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://placeventura.rocks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>placeventura.rocks</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thunderboltsid/PlaceVentura\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/thunderboltsid/PlaceVentura\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["As a full stack developer, I worked on both frontend (Angular Material and lot of custom CSS), and backend (django and postgres).

The conversation can than be held as long as you want, so you can keep posting the photos of yesterdays party to the same audience.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>All code is written in Kotlin, we built an Android app which posts the users location and offers an intuitive UI. The server is based on the Spark java framework and uses a MongoDB to store information. All performance-heavy tasks like gathering information from Facebook and Google, organizing the groups and pushing information is done asynchronously and could be possibly spread across servers, so all requests can be handled immediately (by deferring the expensive tasks) to optimize the mobile experience. The results are then pushed to the devices using Google Cloud Messaging. All queries to MongoDB are directly indexed and limited to the users friends, so we expect a decent scaling.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The usual issues of sharing and synchronizing the model between database, the domain-logic and the client. Since usability is the most important thing to reach a critical mass of users, we focused on a clean and tidy user interface, which is intended to do things implicitely whenever it's possible to avoid bothering the user but at the same time delights with attention to detail.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>Really fast asynchronous task handling and optimized database queries.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A lot about technologies, since 2 of us were not really familiar with Kotlin, nobody knew Spark-java or MongoDB really well.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Deevo</h2>\n<p>More integrations, better UI (introduction, designing empty spaces etc.). </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kotlin</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud-messaging\">google-cloud-messaging</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">spark-java</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Android app completely written in Kotlin, GCM, API Integration, Screen Design, Animations", "I mostly worked on the REST API backend using Kotlin and MongoDB.

This allows for endless possibilities when looking to form complex patterns with The Starnator 9000.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In order to be able to separate every dot from the vertex with equal distance, we had to compute a mathematical algorithm to be able to get the coordinates of n points, all apart from each other by the same distance, as well as being equally apart from the vertex. After this, we create two arrays and give the x values of the coordinates to one, while giving the y values to another, allowing us to connect them later in a much simpler way.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Because the team was made up of somewhat novice programmers, we wanted to learn something new.

Although we struggled we managed to break through every obstacle by researching online and discussing what we thought of each scenario thoroughly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are all very proud not only of learning the bases of two totally different languages to the ones we knew, but of being able to go above and beyond our original idea by being able to leave it to the user where exactly he or she wants the shapes at, as well as the size and color. Even when we had thought we could not add anything more, we decided not to stop and continue coding, by turning our program into a functional <strong>android application</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Like mentioned before, we are all very proud to have learned the html and java-script languages together, helping others when we felt comfortable, while feeling confident enough to ask others about topics we did not feel so good about too. </p>\n<h2>What's next for The Starnator 9000</h2>\n<p>Because of the stunning amount of positive feedback we have gotten from other groups, we have decided to publish the program online, giving the whole world access to our program.

The first part is a hardware implementation of  buttons that can be attached to any smartphone with a device as simple as a clothes peg. This makes it easier to use your phone as a remote controller, just as you wold use a game-pad on a keyboard, but with all the advantages that a smartphone can bring as a gaming platform.\nThe second part of the project is a little multiplayer game to test our buttons with. It consists of up to 4 penguins that race by slipping on ice. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built the buttons using the sillicon membrane of an old keyboard, wire, stylus tips, clothes pegs springs and lots, lots of patience.\nThe game was made in C++ using the SFML libraries. Graphics were made in Gimp.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we succeeded arriving to Bremen, that we are still alive after 3 days of no sleep, and that our game works, more or less. At least it hasn't segfaults.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that the power of love is not enough to implement physics. They lie to us! :( So we had to learn how to implement collisions, gravity, friction, jumps... etc. We also learned how to structure a game that involves various scenes, like a cover, a menu, and various kind of levels. \nWe also learned about the probability distribution when throwing a sticker randomly into the air and let it fall on your laptop. It was great.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sliippy Penguins, Nipple Buttons</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sfml</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kaitokidi/JacobsHack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kaitokidi/JacobsHack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the prallax effects, graphics, and some other parts of the implementation.", "", ""]], ["QuickShare", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>It basically starts an small web server on yours phone.

This network holds the purpose of internship and/or job opportunities at these companies, organized communication between undergrads currently studying &amp; alumni and other networking options.\n(Sign up is optional, of course)\n2.The Event category holds a list of activities currently being held on campus like weekly club events, parties and other social gatherings. An account is not required to create an event which people can follow and get notifications about. This is done to avoid spam and to organize everything.\n3.Professors may check in on the website during their office hours or other activities. This option would be very beneficial for all the students.\n4.Students may ask and answer questions for all their problems.

Instead of informations represented by most linked webpages we decided to replace it by a trust-network.\nIn our scenario the concept of trust-network is included in news  ( or more how we get news ). \nNews today are mostly common by a few media moguls like rtl group or others.\nIn this condition news are more preselected by editorial staff and a lot of news don't reach the ordinary audience ( for example in tv ).\nOne of this news were the xenophic attacs in south africa a few months ago. There were no news about it in german tv.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application is about a trust-network where everyone is allowed to post news and everyone is involved to verify this kind of news. The end consumer designs his own 'newspaper' and decides from where he or she wants to be informed and by which people.\nBy deciding from where he or she wants to be informed and by whom news become a completly new plot in society.\nEveryone is upto this point responsible for themsleve how he/she gets to be informed about what is happining in the world.\nThe technical part about it is to trust an author or not to trust him/her  and to select from whioch country you want to get news.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>24 h swift peer programming</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was my first swift project, so my challenges has a lot to do with how to navigate through the ui and its concept , because i already knew the other ones by former projects in c, c++, c# and java. ;)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>nothing special i am really proud of but it's really cool to learn a new programming language * thumbs up *</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>learned a lot about new ui builder even if i already built some android apps .</p>\n<h2>What's next for FreePress</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mfahl/FreePress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mfahl/FreePress\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Norvos", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When I discovered TextSecure, I wanted to recommend it to my friends and others from a discussion group I am involved in.
