The idea to turn the application into a social media app came from a brainstorming session on how to make it more entertaining. During the brainstorm, we initially envisioned people running after messages to see what was inside. We also thought it would be cool to receive messages that floated from across the country or across the world. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Bubble is an anonymous social media application that allows users to send messages with pictures and text to various parts of the world in a target direction rather than towards are target individual. Bubble users also have the ability to open messages that float past them. The locations of messages are shown in the application through the use of the Esri Map Tools. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The Esri ArcGis API was used to build the map and display the coordinates of messages that were floating in various directions. The Parse API was used for the backend services; data for each message sent from an individual phone was stored on the server. This data included velocity of the message, location, text, and images. Lastly Inkspace was used to create custom icons and graphics for the app, which were animated using native android methods/functions.   </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The largest challenges we faced involved learning the intricacies of the APIs that were used in building the application. For example, debugging some of the Parse and Esri exceptions that we ran into was very time consuming. Furthermore, learning how to use the APIs took a decent amount of time as well.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The application is fairly robust and a lot of effort was put into creating a relatively nice UI. We're also pretty proud that we were able to complete the application in 24 hours. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Hackathons are very very long. We also learned a lot about using the Parse and Esri ArcGis APIs, and Android programming in general. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Bubble</h2>\n<p>We'd like to continue working on implementing features for Bubble and scaling the project overall. Some additions that could be implemented in the future include money transfers and sending out advertisements for companies. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend using Parse to save information about our message objects", "", "", ""]], ["TweetingEcho", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The amazon echo takes short pieces of text as input.

Android then communicates to the TCP java server, which gives the command to press the corresponding key on the computer's keyboard. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>With the Pebble API, the button commands were made. With Android studio, the button commands were received and sent to a server via localhost that gave the computer's keyboard a specific command to press one of the keys.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The communication between the Android and the computer over wifi was a challenge. Since a port has to be left open to listen for the Android request, it would periodically kick us off the router and We'd have to go to a different location and reestablish connection. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It was great being able to dive deep into the Pebble and networking operations. We've seen Pebble many times, so it was nice to explore it further. Likewise, the server side is a weak point for the both of us, so this project was an opportunity to expand our skills and discover more about how these different platforms can communicate. Lastly, after setting up the Oculus and having to manage all the cords, it was nice to know that the Pebble controller has no wires and  doesn't involve as much prep as the rest of the devices. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>So much was learned about the server side of development, and there's still so much left to learn. There's definitely much excitement for another chance to continue growing in that area. The Pebble was simpler, but the more we learned about it, the more we realized how useful it actually can be for daily life if you harness its API in a unique way. I'm curious about the other technologies that can be used in tandem with the Pebble watch. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Callit</h2>\n<p>The next step would be to incorporate the accelerometer on the Pebble and create a larger variety of apps and games using the added controls. Finally, much can be done via the Android as the primary communicator between various technologies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Pebble script (C),  Unity 5 modeling and scripting (Javascript and C#)", ""]], ["fugio", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"fugio \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/841/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"fugio \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/842/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"fugio \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/843/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"fugio \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/844/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"fugio \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/845/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"fugio \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/846/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"fugio \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/847/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1><strong>I Can't Pay My Mortgage</strong></h1>\n<p><strong>This is a project for HackNC.</strong> \nIt is a currency management application that extracts and displays information using the Capital One \"Nessie\" API.

Many college students are familiar with this dilemma: they need to find storage spaces for the summer, but after calling around the area, they find out that most spaces are either reserved already, or they are too large and too expensive to afford on a measly college student salary. We built Tetrispace to help these poor souls (and anyone else in need of a storage solution) find a way to keep their belongings safe and sound over any period of time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Tetrispace provides a platform for users to reduce storage costs by renting out a portion of their unused storage space to others in need of storage. For example, due to high demand, a college student may only be able to get a 100 sq ft storage area, when he only needs 30 sq ft of storage. Using Tetrispace, he can rent out the other 70 sq ft with his own custom asking price, and other users can find his listing and instantly reserve the space with the built-in transaction handler.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The frontend was developed with Bootstrap, JQuery, handlebars, the Google Maps API, and the Capital One Nessie API, and the backend is a mix of NodeJS, Express, Posgre SQL, and SQLite.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some difficulty making API calls between outside APIs and our project's REST APIs.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Each team member was working in a role that they were inexperienced in, and we feel that we performed above and beyond.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Javascript based technologies to develop and debug rapidly.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tetrispace</h2>\n<p>We're going to rough out the edges of the UI/UX and implement an authentication mechanism.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/handlebars-js\">handlebars.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nessie-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://tetrispace-app.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://tetrispace-app.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tetrispace-app.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tetrispace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://tetrispace.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tetrispace.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alvinsi/tetrispace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alvinsi/tetrispace\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the frontend by building a responsive webpage and single-page application using CSS, HTML, JS, and Bootstrap", "I worked on backend.

We originally started by developing a digital-to-analog converter but realized that we could reverse engineer the board that they had provided.  We started off with what looked like the microcontroller (which was unlabeled) and probed the pins until we found the constant 5v and grounds. We did a search for what microcontroller had that particular pin arrangement and found that it was an Intel 5051 or at least a nock-off of it.  We then used the datasheet to prob the pins for the data wires.  After finding which wires we thought were data we were able to find a chip that was a digital-to-analog converter.  With that datasheet in hand we were successfully able to remove the Intel 5051 and replace the signals with that from an Arduino we used to test with.  After the Arduino test was a success we swapped over to Raspberry Pi.  We then started to write a 3d rendering software for the Raspberry Pi to display 3D shapes using the laser projector.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The inertia of the mirrors caused many issues with using the laser project and having to use delays so that the dot would keep up with the processing power of the Raspberry Pi.  We ran into an issue with paths while developing the 3D engine.  The engine would return the 3d points but not with the dots connected.  We had to develop a algorithm to connect the dots.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Developing the software that communicates with the hardware and making it render 3d.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned some of the complications of rendering 3D and communicating over a network.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Laser Projector</h2>\n<p>The laser is currently only green.  We would like to make it RGB.  The 3D library needs more work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opengl\">opengl</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/egtoneyUK/HackNC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/egtoneyUK/HackNC\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the design and wireless network communication parts of this project.

Whether it was going from the airport to my school or even across a couple of states to a hackathon, there was no common platform that addressed this issue. This struck me as a little odd considering how useful carpooling turns out to be.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hitched in its very essence finds you an optimal rider/ driver based on the overlapping of paths and cost of detours. While thinking of hitched, I knew I did not want it to be a pseudo taxi service that takes you from point A to B, but make use of the fact that this wasn't a completely professional service. There are often cases when a person can be dropped enroute or just at a couple minutes detour relative to another person's trip. The algorithm used for this app makes use of that. The general threshold is that the detour shouldn't cause a delay of more than 8% of the total travelling time of the actual driver. Thus keeping these constraints in mind, and using ESRI's awesome API, this carpooling app recommends ideal drivers to people requesting a trip and then gives the drivers a chance to accept or reject a request.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The backend is built in python. The webapp was built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Our database is Firebase. Again a huge shoutout to the Esri API</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a really hard time creating the frontend for this project. This was our first time working on frontend so I learnt alot, but definitely the hard way. We also could not finish understanding how flask works with python hence we werent able to completely sync my backend code and the front end elements. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>On the other hand I'm really proud of the backend code and I will be more than happy to show you the cool extra features I added that you probably wouldn't see otherwise. I loved figuring out the ESRI API , and despite this being a hackathon I ended up writing clean and elegant code which made me really happy.

This approach to development focuses on a project's backlog, prioritized by the time remaining on each task.</p>\n<p>He found that he organized his own work in a similar manner, prioritizing his tasks not simply by when they are due, but by a litany of other factors.

Conventional \"to-do list\" apps would prioritize the email to the Intern before the report to my boss because it is due first. However, we all know that I really _ italics_ should be working on that report. With the nuance provided by Agile Tasker, I would be guided more prudently through my work. With Agile Tasker, rather than setting alarms (that I will inevitably ignore) to send emails, I'll simply get my work done in a more appropriate order.</p>\n<p>Although the benefits of Agile Tasker are immediately apparent in its use by a single person, they become must more impactful when the application is used to guide a team of people.\nLet's examine it's potential uses in a software development team. These developers will likely have scores of individual tasks to complete in a day. Rather than spending an hour a day delegating tasks out to each member of the team, Agile Tasker could quickly rank the importance of these tasks.\nThus, Agile Tasker minimizes the amount of time you or your organization spends planning and maximizes the amount of time you spend doing.</p>\n<h2>How I built</h2>\n<p>We built a cross platform mobile application that uses ionic and Cordova to produce a native-looking experience on what is, in reality, a web application. Ionic is driven primarily by Angularjs, which was a bit of a project to learn, but in the end allowed us to avoid writing code to manipulate the DOM. We packaged the application for Android only, as none of us had either a windows phone or an Apple developer license.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>None of the members of our team had ever used Angular, Ionic, or Cordova, and one member of our team had never attempted a software project before, so spun our wheels against several bugs due to our inexperience with the platform. The software stack we used is very extensible and approachable, but this often left us having trouble figuring out the best way to create a consistent ui using disparate plugins.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are satisfied that we jumped into a technology that we didn't know, and yet finished the core application.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Agile Tasker</h2>\n<p>We will continue to flesh out the app by adding features and integrating it with other productivity applications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/brain-murphy/agile-tasker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/brain-murphy/agile-tasker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Follow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to design a game that was all in browser.\nAfter much deliberation the idea that stuck out the most was something akin to a drum battle.\nWe took this idea and turned into a pattern matching game instead of beat matching.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Much like the game simon, this game pits multiple players up against each other in turn base pattern memorization</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>node.js http server using websockets</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>debugging </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Actually getting it done</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The route to true happiness</p>\n<h2>What's next for Follow</h2>\n<p>Sleep</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://luke-doty@bitbucket.org/luke-doty/hacknc.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://luke-doty@bitbucket.org/luke-doty/hacknc.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on everything (node server, websocket, front end)", "Design and Graphics", ""]], ["Beam Battles", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Beam Battles \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/303/052/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Beam Battles \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/303/055/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I saw a similar game on Newgrounds years ago, but it just had a single player AI and I wanted to make it multiplayer.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You can battle your friends by shooting beams at each other.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I set up a node server running express and used EaselJS for rendering.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Online multiplayer was tough to get working.

Quickly and easily create dynamically split bills that can be paid in as few as 2 button presses! TabYouLater is a fast micropayments solution based on the Capital One API and hosted on Microsoft's Azure Mobile Services to serve an increasingly digital world. We allow for users to assume the full cost of some items, such as a group dinner, and issue micro-invoices, or tabs, for other members of the group to fill. </p>\n<p>This is done as transparently as possible, with the \"creditor\", or in this case whoever is hosting the tab, simply creating an invoice with the total cost, and having the other members of the group add themselves to the tab by scanning the generated QR code. As each person adds themselves, the total cost will be split again and again, until the creditor signals the end of the joining phase and closes the invoice, sending the newly split bill to each persons Capital One account.</p>\n<p>If a person either doesn't have a Capital One account, or lacks the funds to cover the charge, a debt will be created, trackable only by the creditor. This debt will either need to be settled by adding additional funds to the account, or have it settled off record between the creditor and debtor. </p>\n<p>We believe that TabYouLater can fill an integral role in the Payments as a Service space, especially as we begin to add other payment channels through other banks, and perhaps explore the usage of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as a settlement layer (that is to say settling debts inbetween banks on a very fast basis). </p>\n<p>Domain: tabyoulater.net</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul

Researchers spend years planning, funding, and executing expeditions to remote locations of the globe to collect samples for study. After extracting DNA samples in the lab, researchers use open-source software tools, such as <a href=\"http://qiime.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Qiime</a>, to process their DNA sequencing data. While such software efficiently processes the data, researchers are left with the challenge of interpreting it -- rows upon rows of numbers.</p>\n<p>GeneBurst, acting as a direct Qiime to <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">D3.js</a> converter, meets the cyberinfrastructure needs of biological researchers. It takes the raw CSV data that Qiime outputs and convertes it to a JSON file that can be passed into our D3.js sunburst visualization. A sunburst, which depicts the community composition of an individual location, has a hierarchical structure; as the burst progresses radially outward, it increases in taxonomic resolution. The size of each sunburst arc encodes the given taxonomic unit's percentage by biomass of a community. For our example visualization, we've used data from an Antarctic research project by the Arnosti lab of UNC Marine Sciences.</p>\n<p>While GeneBurst is designed to be used with Qiime, it will provide a tree-structured visualization for any dataset in the following format:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>levelName,set0,set1,set2,set3,setN\nlevel0;level1;level2;levelN,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1\nlevel0;level1;level2;levelN,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1\nlevel0;level1;level2;levelN,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1\nlevel0;level1;level2;levelN,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>An example using taxonomic stucture and percentage of occurences of organisms at different sites:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>taxon,site0,site1,site2,site3,site4\ndomainName0;kingdomName0;phylumName0;className0;orderName0;familyName0;genusName0;speciesName0,0.2,0.9,0.99,0.2,0.1\ndomainName1;kingdomName1;phylumName1;className1;orderName1;familyName1;genusName1;speciesName1,0.3,0.1,0.0,0.2,0.3\ndomainName2;kingdomName2;phylumName2;className2;orderName2;familyName2;genusName2;speciesName2,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.3,0.4\ndomainName3;kingdomName3;phylumName3;className3;orderName3;familyName3;genusName3;speciesName3,0.2,0.0,0.01,0.3,0.2\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"http://geneburst.jebarb.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">geneburst.jebarb.com</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://geneburst.jebarb.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://geneburst.jebarb.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>geneburst.jebarb.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Vite", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BgDEUPiviNo?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Books are awesome, but they can get uncomfortable to carry around, not to mention that it requires effort to remain focused when reading.

The biggest inspiration, however, probably comes from Phoenix for TI-83 and TI-84, written in Assembly. Texas Instruments calculators got me interested in programming and eventually became my first experience in writing code, through the horrendous TI-BASIC.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The player progresses through 4 increasingly complex levels. The first level is by far the simplest, intended to introduce anyone unfamiliar with the genre to how it functions. The rules are simple: destroy various invading enemy ships while avoiding death by a plethora of multicolored projectiles. The first level requires a combination of pattern recognition and nimble reaction time to pass.\nThe second level adds an element of mindgames to the traditional shooter. Two of the enemies faced, Illusions, are untouchable with laser fire, while another two, Spectres, are invisible. In order to pass the level, the player must be able to deduce the locations of the two invisible enemy ships  without falling prey to the distraction of two visible but untouchable enemy ships.\nThe third level is built around forcing the player's strengths against the player.It is the only level where you can completely predict enemy actions. because they are responses to the player ship.  For example, one enemy mirrors the player's position while firing back, while another reflects all incoming fire. In order to pass the level, the player must think one step ahead, answering the question \"How do I trade fire such that I always come out ahead?\"\nThe final level features a boss with large amounts hp and firepower. This level also introduces homing missiles that actively the follow the player. However, their turning rate is limited, so it is possible to avoid them by waiting until they get as close as possible, then dodging at the last second, which forces the missile to loop back around. The missiles detonate in balls of fire, which deal large amounts of damage over time. Similarly, the boss's purifier laser is very weak if the player is able to get out of the way very quickly, but is capable of doing very large amounts of damage over time. In order to beat the level, the player necessarily has to make sacrifices, avoiding one source of damage by getting hit by another, and requires quick decision making as well as planning ahead.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The entirety of the game is written in Java 8, taking heavy advantage of Java's java.awt library. No external libraries were used. All the code was composed and edited using NetBeans IDE. All the sprites used were created through GIMP, using images found online as starting points.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Rotating images was a problem for me. I ended up using the transformation matrix which rotates the image clockwise by a factor of theta. For the homing missiles, I used arctangent to find the angle between the missile and the player. However, java's implementation of arctangent goes from 0 to pi halves, then negative pi halves to pi halves, then negative pi/halves back to 0, going counterclockwise. Also, angles are necessarily modular arithmetic as well, making this more complicated. I was able to solve the issue with a few if clauses that translated the range to a smooth curve from 0 to 2*pi.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I created the game with a lot of room to scale in mind. I tried to hardcode as little as possible, and I made it as simple as possible to create new levels, new classes, and new game mechanics. This required a large number of abstract classes and polymorphism. Essentially, every object had some variant of an act() method, which would govern the specific behaviors of that class. All the objects existed within an arrayList, which would be iterated over to call act() on each object. This means that expansion is very easy. For example, each level is simply a list of the enemies involved. Any new enemies can extend public abstract class EnemyShip, which holds the basic capabilities of any enemy ship, and requires only unique behaviors be implemented.</p>\n<p>Also, my soundtrack is sick, using completely free and unlicensed music.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was my first hackathon, as well as my first programming project of this kind of scale. Needless to say, I learned a lot. I think the most valuable thing was learning when something is \"finished\". Because of limited time, it's impossible to work on something forever. Consequently, I had to know when to drop or scale down certain features because of time constraints, and accept products as \"finished\" even when I wasn't satisfied with them.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Invasion--Game</h2>\n<p>This game really needs to have a way to restart the game. As it is now, the game simply stops execution at the game over screen until you close and reopen the executable. This would also include checkpoints and save files, allowing you to save and load at the beginning of each level.\nI would also add the ability to change the player's ship, either temporarily in the form of powerups, or permanently in the form of unlockable alternate ships chosen at the beginning of the game. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://1drv.ms/1LHxpdq\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://1drv.ms/1LHxpdq\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>1drv.ms</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["CastBox", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Being at a party and not being able to control what music you\u2019re listening to.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Android app that searches youtube for videos to add to a playlist.

We wanted to see how we could use the GPIO pins to potentially make a low-latency network between the Raspberry Pi's.  Afterwards, we came to the idea that we could make these Raspberry Pi's play telephone with each other, and the final idea was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This Python code runs on Raspberry Pi's and allows their GPIO pins to act as a token-ring based local area network.  The network is low-latency, but also low bandwidth.  This is good for security reasons, as well as potentially for networking them as microcontrollers for a larger machine or for industrial automation.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The project used three Raspberry Pi's, a breadboard, and a ton of wire.  After everything was hooked up and plugged into power, the software is put anywhere on the Raspberry Pi's hard drives, and once it's run the network is up and running.  Then it just takes a user entering \"start\" into one of the programs to watch the magic happen.</p>\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n<p>Copy LazySusan.py somewhere on the raspberry pi.</p>\n<p>Use pip or easy_install to install the numpy and bitstream packages.</p>\n<p>Run each instance of LazySusan.py on seperate Raspberry Pi's, hooked together with whichever GPIO pins you prefer, the list of the ones we used is right near the top of the program.</p>\n<p>Each instance is run via a command like \"sudo python LazySusan.py \".  The \"sudo\" is important, and all of the instances should be run with unique integers (they act as Node IDs)</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Raspberry Pi is not quite that great at being a microcontroller.  Synchronizing them together for direct communication is quite difficult, and without being extremely careful, the electrical components are noisy.  This makes telling whether you are reading hi's or low's on the pins hard.</p>\n<p>I, as well as the rest of the team, did not know a lick of Python before this project.  So that was fun.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>I think I speak for the whole team when I say that we did a great job working together to create something fun.  We had to overcome hardware and software obstacles, and by banding together and playing to our respective strengths I think we accomplished a ton in 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The whole team learned a ton of Python and a great amount about how the Raspberry Pi works.  We also experimented with using Wolfram Alpha's API and using distributed computing to determine average floating point error on large multiply and divide operations.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Lazy Suzan Communications</h2>\n<p>Potentially Hack Duke!

OSC was excellent, and since it was network-based, we were able to constantly send datastreams to all of our laptops from the device so that we could all perform testing with real, live data without having to schedule time with the computer under test.</p>\n<h2>What's next for biogen-music</h2>\n<p>In the future, we'd like to do some higher-level calibration and digital signal processing in order to be able to analyze alpha/beta/gamma brain activity. This would allow the wearer to not only generate biometrically unique sounds, but to control it consciously on a high-level.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">supercollider</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">emotiv-epoc</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">osc</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/woodrowbarlow/biogen-music\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/woodrowbarlow/biogen-music\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped get the hardware up and running and learned about super collider!", "", ""]], ["RadiUS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyone gets bored sometimes.

Depending on the situation, sometimes you need to find that perfect font that matches up with the surrounding images. However, the current font databases that exist are lacking in ways to find fonts. Thus, we wanted to make a more descriptive font database.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our font database allows users to contribute to font descriptions. Users are presented with an interactive game that \nserves as an easy way to contribute to our database. In thirty seconds, anyone can improve the quality of the database by suggesting keywords or short phrases that describe the font. We're using the power of human thinking to improve a process that would be much more difficult for computers to accomplish. Since our database will be directed towards other people, human validation is a very important part of our project. Each font tag needs to be suggested multiple times before it appears in the database. This ensures that the tags present are an accurate perception of the font by many different people. Through this process, we will many descriptive font tags that makes it easy for anyone to find the perfect font for the perfect occasion.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The front end font listing and game are created with AngularJS, while the back end consists of Laravel running on a LAMP server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Overall, this project was quite the learning experience, as most of us did not have prior experience with AngularJS. However we managed to learn a lot, and managed to create a working build of our project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're especially proud of how much AngularJS we've learned in 12 hours. We're also proud of how we created a fully functioning web application that anybody can use to find and describe fonts.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>While we gained a lot of programming experience, we also learned how to work as a team. It was a great bonding experience for all of us, and had a lot of fun at our first hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fontacular!</h2>\n<p>While our site is fully functional, there is still a lot that we can improve on. For example, while we currently have a limited amount of fonts on the server, we plan to allow users to upload fonts in the future. Our game could also be improved, with more engaging gameplay elements, to encourage others to contribute. All in all, this was an incredible experience, and we hope to continue hacking in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phpmyadmin\">phpmyadmin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nessie</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://db.fontacular.com/#/fonts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://db.fontacular.com/#/fonts\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>db.fontacular.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://game.fontacular.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://game.fontacular.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>game.fontacular.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did front-end code for the database using mostly AngularJS.", "I did front-end code using AngularJS, jQuery, and javascript.", "", ""]], ["ReadRoom", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ReadRoom \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/180/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ReadRoom \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/181/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ReadRoom \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/182/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ReadRoom \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/302/183/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>ReadRoom</h1>\n<p>Keep track of what you've read and what you want to read</p>\n<p>Start by hitting \"Search\" and typing in a query.
