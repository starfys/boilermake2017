We worked around that problem in two ways. First we were able to use a library called WebGL which allows Javascript to make use of the client's graphics card and spin up thousands of threads to work in parallel. Secondly, we joined a Bitcoin mining pool which allows us to team up with other miners around the world. Once our pool is able to solve an entry in the block chain we all split the earnings according to the amount of work contributed by each miner.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Charity Coins</h2>\n<p>Future enhancements include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working with other currencies which are optimized for CPU mining.</li>\n<li>Automatic detection of the clients' hardware</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opengl\">opengl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webgl\">webgl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I completed front-end work and integrated the bitcoin miner with our site.", "", "", ""]], ["BreathEZ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BreathEZ \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/415/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BreathEZ \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/416/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BreathEZ \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/417/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BreathEZ \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/418/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BreathEZ \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/419/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration comes from the 40 million people in the United States alone who are affected by this highly treatable mental disorder.

The app also offers a convenient solution towards monitoring one's mental health through its automatically logging system, as well as being able to reach a loved one or emergency contact with just one click.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built this app using Swift 3.0, Cocoapods, and a variety of system frameworks including Core-Foundation, AV-Foundation, Core-Animation, and Core-Data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I had issues with getting accurate and fast measurements of the breathing data.
