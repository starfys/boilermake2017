Then we realized that mass polling in general, such as in a college campus, is also weak and inconsistent. Finally, we decided to build a product to make polling smooth, non-intrusive, and potentially significantly more accurate and insightful. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users can join polling channels by scanning QR codes. For example, Wash U students can scan the Wash U QR code to gain entry into the Wash U polling channel. When a question is posed to the community, all recipients within the respective channel will get the question via SMS. If inclined to do so, the citizens can reply not only with their answers, but also with their explanations and opinions. Our backend parses through all the text messages, and returns a succinct summary of the citizens' average general attitude towards the topic, in addition to popular keywords and phrases. For example, if the question \"Should we bring back Motz Sticks?\" was asked to Wash U's channel, the summary of all the responses would read something like \"The attitude towards Motz Sticks is ecstatic.\" Not only does our product provide the most convenient way of polling citizens at any scale, but it also provides extremely powerful data analysis that converts the results in succinct summaries. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>iOS, Twilio, IBM Alchemy</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Hooking up all the multiple backend modules was a pain. Documentation and online support for Alchemy was not the strongest. The backend of the project is huge, so naturally it was the sources of most of our challenges. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting data analysis to work and summary creation to work. Also the \"joining communities via QR code\" was pretty cool. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Backend is hard.

There are tons of place-finding apps out there. We aspired to make on that wasn't just simple and easy-to-use, but also one that was fun and interactive.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users can use the voice command to search for something they're in the mood for \u2014 such as \"burgers\" or \"museums\". The app will search the nearby area for attractions and restaurants, and will save that query as a recommendation to others when they shake their phone and get a random query. Users can shake the device at any time to retrieve a random query from someone in their local area.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app was built for iOS (Swift) and hits our server (coded in PHP and deployed on Apache), which contacts TripAdvisor's API and keeps track of queries so they can be returned as random recommendations for people in the area. We wanted to make it as simple as possible, so we implemented AT&amp;T's various speech to text recognition.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>   Integrating the AT&amp;T SDK in Swift \u2014 the source files were written in Objective-C and required us to write a bridging header to allow their use in Swift. Additionally, their authentication sample code was written in Objective-C (pre-ARC), and required additional setup to implement correctly. </li>\n<li>    Implementing the Tripadvisor API \u2014 a slight change (+/- .01) in coordinates would return somewhat bizarre results. We used the coordinates for Saint Louis and hardcoded them into the app for now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to add a fun twist to the app \u2014 the ability to shake your phone and get a random query from people in your local area. It was a blast to use while we were developing this project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Keep your project goal reasonable, and execute a small idea as well as possible.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for CityMood</h2>\n<p>There's a lot of potential for existing functionality to be improved upon - for example, adding a place to a favorites list so that it can be recommended to others in the area. Another idea is to sort results by fields such as distance, percent recommended, and rating.</p>\n<h2>Images</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Landing Page\" data-canonical-url=\"http://s2.postimg.org/arf1g3fax/12025846_10203484737597325_1652216794_o.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--znfcJ8NV--/http://s2.postimg.org/arf1g3fax/12025846_10203484737597325_1652216794_o.jpg\"/>\n<img alt=\"Search Screen\" data-canonical-url=\"http://s2.postimg.org/km66mbj95/12019290_10203484737677327_659366930_o.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--RGK_4tg4--/http://s2.postimg.org/km66mbj95/12019290_10203484737677327_659366930_o.jpg\"/>\n<img alt=\"Search Screen\" data-canonical-url=\"http://s2.postimg.org/4cg0jf8l5/12043470_10203484737637326_1771507156_o.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--xgqCJPNJ--/http://s2.postimg.org/4cg0jf8l5/12043470_10203484737637326_1771507156_o.jpg\"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoa\">cocoa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tripadvisor\">tripadvisor</a></span></li><li></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">guzzle</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">composer</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I developed our app's server.

I've been to Niagara Falls no less than 7 times so far; however, the only experience that I remember from those 7 is the time when I went with a mutual friend who is a native of Niagara Falls. He offered me different vantage points that truly made this 7th trip to Niagara Falls the most memorable. Why not make your first trip just as memorable?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TourUs is a crowdsourcing platform that matches the interests and potential locations of tourists to various tourguides who are knowledgeable about a particular location. We have a custom matching algorithm that creates a \"score\" based on the number of mutual interests between a tourist and tourguide and returns these results back to the tourist. The tourist can then view the profile of a tourguide to judge whether or not he/she would be a good fit for them. Even if the tourist doesn't wish to contact the tourguide, they can even view the list of reccommended events, places, or experiences to adventure at a certain location. They can then decide when/where they want to meet up, if they decide to do so, and the tourguide can be tipped by the tourist.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Our entire tech stack revolves around meteor.js which combines client and server side code into a single easy to deploy system. Meteor uses MongoDB for the database, and a templating language of HTML5 for the frontend. Much of the dynamic client interfacing and backend interfacing is written in javascript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Before this hackathon 36 hours ago, none of us had ever touched Meteor.js or had extensive experience with javascript. As a result, writing much of the client and server side turned out to be a larger learning curve than we had imagined. In addition, MongoDB which was very different from the SQL databases we were accustomed to using was hard to understand due to its dynamic schema. We also had to understand the concept of reactivity with respect to Meteor.js. We were also about 6 hours late to the hackathon, which was a bit crippling in terms of time management; we found ourselves a bit rushed at the end, but managed to pull it together!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're really proud that we were able to put our idea to fruition in whatever capacity. In addition, we're proud that the matching algorithm worked as we had imagined, and that the entire website was much more polished than we originally envisioned.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot of Meteor.js this weekend.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TourUs</h2>\n<p>TechDisrupt 2016</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iron-router</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tripadvisor\">tripadvisor</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/square\">square</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TimothySanchirico/taurus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TimothySanchirico/taurus\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Created the frontend.

Others can click join and enter the code, letting them browse the Spotify music library and send selections to the host. UniSound uses a weighting ranking system, which the host can customize, to create a more harmonious playlist.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created UniSound with the new Spotify Web API, which is a little over a year old, in order to query Spotify's vast music library. The app converts the Spotify models into client-side objects (object-oriented javascript, indeed!) that carry out operations and calculations. Firebase provides the server-side, tracking the songs, participants, and mood of musical hangouts through objects we affectionately call, \"jukeboxes.\"</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Spotify takes full advantage of its dual nature as a desktop application and web browser application, and using its API at first made our app unfriendly to non-Spotify users (the vile Pandora worshipers) and mobile devices. Since we don't want those groups to be left out of a fun party, we used the API to call 30-second song samples as MP3 files that can be played in more browsers and devices. Thankfully, for the browsers and devices that don't support audio players, all a group needs is one device/speaker pair in order to start rocking their beats!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Chloe, for designing the gorgeous graphics that make up UniSound's unique brand.\nMatt and Yongzheng for learning how to serve databases with Firebase literally overnight in order to bring the app to life.\nMatt for an admirable performance in the WUHacks cornhole tournament.\nVinesh for connivingly devising a scheme to replace Spotify's song players with nicer, custom UIs.\nAnd everyone for struggling with OAuth tokens that conspired to expire at precisely the most inconvenient times.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Firebase is beautiful.\nJavaScript does not care about your agenda.\nWhen you need the answer to a question so troubling that it didn't even make it onto StackOverflow, you will find it in the depths of the internet where some other kind soul has posted precisely the question you were wondering about... only to discover that that person forgot to respond when a respondent asked for more details.</p>\n<h2>What's next for UniSound</h2>\n<p>Coming soon...</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spotify\">spotify</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/inkscape\">inkscape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stack-overflow\">stack-overflow</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://unisound.tk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://unisound.tk\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>unisound.tk</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Kevin and I tackled the back-end, rolling through multiple options for hours until deciding upon Firebase.

They may not like if I developed this further and got a large fan base.. it may reduce their fanbase on the native application game. I think it was fun to build considering it's my first real game for the browser. But in all honesty, I know I could make this an awesome experience, i.e. great functionality for the user. So I think whatever i'll do next will be more challenging.. I'm looking forward to 3D browser based games that are comparable in performance and awesomeness as native applications</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://secret-garden-3353.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://secret-garden-3353.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>secret-garden-3353.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did everything regarding this project.

For the first time, we'll have data visualizations of how students sleep around the country and have the ability to compare these across campuses and examine how sleep schedules may vary over the course of the academic year. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>My three team members and I built SleepEasy during the WUHack hackathon event in September, 2015. It is a full stack web app with a functioning Google Chrome extension which relays data to our server which in turn provides data for our website which displays all of our charts and other data visualizations. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We first attempted to develop using D3 for our visualizations. This proved much more difficult than we originally anticipated but we hope to return to it when we have more time. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our extensive backend required substantial work from our team and hit many bumps along the way but now runs as smoothly as we always needed it to. We also developed our first ever Google Chrome extension. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to interface with C3 to make our graphs as well as Google's APIs for their Chrome extensions. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SleepEasy</h2>\n<p>We don't plan to stop developing after the hackathon. The obvious next step will be to develop an Add-on for Mozilla Firefox to accompany our Chrome extension. We also want to expand upon our knowledge of graphing capabilities and create a greater number of more eloquent visualizations. Another clear step forward is the development of a mobile app so that users can update their sleep data from their phones as well as from their web browsers. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tayebzaidi/LockBox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tayebzaidi/LockBox\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["gitr.", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gitr. \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/391/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gitr. \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/392/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gitr. \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/393/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gitr. \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/394/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gitr. \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/395/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to learn new languages and technologies, but it can sometimes be difficult to find good reference projects.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It bounces you across GitHub repositories according to your preferences.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Dart to write a web scraper to quickly build up a Mongo database hosted on MongoLab.

More than 99% of all emails are sent unencrypted, meaning that anyone can intercept and read them. The technology exists for us to encrypt every single email, but we don't do it. Why? <em>Because it's a pain.</em> Nobody has time to read through 20,000 words of documentation about public keys and initialization vectors every time they want to send an email to someone new, and security just doesn't work if no one uses it.</p>\n<p><strong>That's where we come in.</strong> Solus is encrypted email for everyone. It takes care of all the details of sending secure mail for you (using S/MIME or OpenPGP), which means that a process that could take hours now requires just a single click. Solus integrates with your favorite email clients, so you don't have to change a thing - just click the little lock icon, and it'll handle the rest.</p>\n<p>We think email security should work like web security - easy, strong, and free. That's why Solus is based on rock-solid encryption protocols, and why it doesn't implement any cryptography from scratch. Instead, Solus focuses on making sure it's as easy as possible to do the boring parts of encryption, like key generation and exchange, so you can spend less time thinking about PKCS and Cryptographic Message Syntax, and more time communicating with the people you care about, safely and securely.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Benevolence.js", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A teammate threw the idea out and we went with it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It works like other libraries such as jquery.

We started out by deciding on a problem to tackle. So at college, when I want to play a</p>\n<p>pickup basketball game all I do is go to the courts and someone is there already playing. It\u2019s that easy. However, over </p>\n<p>the summer, when I return to the real world this is no longer a possibility. I have to text friends and find out when </p>\n<p>everyone is free and what time works best. Then I have to find a court for us to play on and let everyone know and this </p>\n<p>only works if there happen to be enough people in my group of friends free at that time. Often with larger team sports </p>\n<p>finding 10 friends all simultaneously free is impossible. In almost all cases, everything has to be planned in advance. To </p>\n<p>alleviate this problem, we set out to create a network that would provide the infrastructure to find athletes in one\u2019s own </p>\n<p>area. This new digital venue would minimize the overhead necessary to start a pickup game.  That is why we created Pikup.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">magic</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the algorithm for finding the nearest field to the biggest cluster of players registered to one game as well as the design and presentation.", "I worked on the back end, front end website design and the database integration.
