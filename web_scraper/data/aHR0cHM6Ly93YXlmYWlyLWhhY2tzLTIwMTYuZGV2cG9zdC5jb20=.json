WFSnapNSearch</h2>\n<p>WFSnapNSearch was created as a project for the Wayfair hackathon. Our current project is built as a recommendation system for products based on your location. Using trained neural networks we will determine the location in which the photo was taken and then present a list of recommended items to the user as links to Wayfair.com. When dealing with recommendations we also determine some of the objects in the photo. These objects will compared with a recommendation list based off the determined location. The objects that are missing from the list are then presented as links to Wayfair.com.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Setting Up</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>1. Navigate to the main WFSnapNSearch directory\n2. Make sure you have Caffe installed\n3. Download the trained Caffe models from the Google Drive Link Below and put them in the neural_network directory (as specified by the neural_network README.md file)\n4. run: pip install -r requirements.txt\n    This should install all Modules necessary to run the project (if any are missing run pip install [module name] and please let us know)\n</code></pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-K2rtKjAgcNeHRlOFFtSlVkMUk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trained Caffe Models Google Drive Link</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Launching the WFSnapNSearch Web App</h2>\n<p>To run the WFSnapNSearch application:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>1. Navigate to the main WFSnapNSearch directory \n2. run: python app.py\nFor getting recommendations on what itmes would go great in your location follow the 'b':\n3b. Open your preferred browser and navigate to http://localhost:3006/wfsnapnsearch/recommender\n4b. Upload your photo of the room you'd like recommendations for\n5b. Bask in the glory of the products that will soon complement your room\nFor searching by photo (currently unavailable) follow the 'a':\n3a. Open your preferred browser and navigate to http://localhost:3006/wfsnapnsearch/\n4a. Upload your photo of the home good you wish to search\n5a. Be amazed as the closest product to the product you always wanted is available for you to purchase \n</code></pre>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Future Vision</h2>\n<p>The project goal was to train a neural network model on specifically Wayfair data to be used for image recognition and searching. The user could then provide an image of some product (whether it be a photo they had taken or one from online) to our project and the model would be able to determine as much about the image that would be relevant to find similar products on Wayfair.com. The information determined by the model would then be sent as a search query to Wayfair.com resulting in a \"search by image\" functionality.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>This project does not reflect Wayfair.com and is seperate from the company\n:shipit:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">caffe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jinja\">jinja</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mwiesman/WFSnapNSearch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mwiesman/WFSnapNSearch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built full stack python flask app for uploading images and displaying results, used materialize css for design, and connected the back end to the neural network python wrapper built by my partner.", "Worked on designing and finetuning two convolutional neural networks to do indoor scene recognition and objects detection"]], ["dineR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"dineR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/395/768/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"dineR \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/395/769/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Order confirmation</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The 5 of us gathered in our summer sublet\u2019s living room (furnished lavishly with our $25 Walmart tables) and thought, \u201cwhat facet of life could we try to improve with technology?\u201d One of us shouted out, \u201cWhat about Tinder swiping for food?\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Another one responded.</p>\n<p>\u201cWell, when you want to order food, pretty much your best option is something like Grubhub. In a typical case, you have to call the restaurant directly. The process takes time and people tend to be indecisive about a menu\u2019s option, since you\u2019re typically given more than 50 items to choose from. What if we took out the hard work and made the process super simple? Instead of looking at a long menu, you\u2019d get meals in the form of cards, similar to Tinder. You can swipe left or right or save, and that\u2019s it. If you want it, swipe right to customize, choose delivery or pickup, and BOOM!\u201d Everything would be location based as well, so dineR could be your one stop app for \u2018I want food now.\u2019</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>With dineR, our goal was to build on the success of Tinder's swipe formula to drastically reduce the time it takes to order a meal as well as eliminate the element of indecision associated with choosing your dining options. \nWhile there are many food ordering options available, no solution gives you the ability to order a meal extremely quickly. We wanted to build on the success of Tinder - replacing myriad options with small binary decisions. With dineR, you can swipe with Tinder like functionality to choose a meal you\u2019d like  right now. You are immediately shown options from restaurants that are open and will deliver to your location. You swipe left if you want to order the meal presented to you, or swipe right if you don\u2019t like what you see. All you have to do is confirm any modifications to the order (extra pickles, tomatoes, meat options, etc) as well as choose delivery vs pickup. That\u2019s it! </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Meteor as our application framework. Meteor is a full stack JavaScript (built on top of NodeJS) approach to creating apps, and it\u2019s awesome! You get tons of features for free with Meteor -&gt; app reactivivity, web sockets, an amazing package community for stuff like user authentication and tables.  We used React as the front end Javascript framework, and Ionic for building the mobile view. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>React! I think we still don\u2019t fully understand this.props! \nBut also, we decided to built an admin console to show the \u2018restaurant facing\u2019 side of our app, and since our main swiping app was built with Ionic, we had to spin up another separate Meteor app with a typical web app view. We also wanted orders to come in to the admin console as soon as a user would swipe right, forcing us to hack a way for both apps to connect to the same MongoDB database. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Wiring everything together was very fun! We also really enjoyed mapping out the entire storyboard for the app. It was really cool to see an idea evolve from idea to a coded implementation. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>None of us knew ReactJS. Most of us new have never used Meteor. Those of who were familiar with Node and Meteor helped out the others who were diving in for the first time. There\u2019s a lot to learn about Javascript apps, but we feel it\u2019s the future (especially React) and a great opportunity to learn a lot. </p>\n<h2>What's next for dineR</h2>\n<p>We want the experience to only improve as the user uses the app more often. This means doing things like adding machine learning features to the app, so we can learn from the user\u2019s preferences.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\" https://github.com/jm2242/dineR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\" https://github.com/jm2242/dineR\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dinerapp.tk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dinerapp.tk\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>dinerapp.tk</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Designed the architecture for the application and helped get everyone up to speed with Meteor.

The basis of the idea was a desire to create a tool that would invoke creativity and inspiration for designers. The designer would be placed in a virtual environment designed to cultivate inspiration. The project was developed using Unity and the Vive Virtual Reality Headset. Users are placed in a 3D virtual environment and given the ability to create shapes using the Vive controller. The user can use the controller to manipulate the size, color, and textures of their drawing tool and create 3D objects. The tool also allows the user to use voice recognition to create images and words in the environment that can help invoke further inspiration.</p>\n<h1>Team</h1>\n<p>Vincent Arena, Peter Cheung, Jason Noh, Joshua Pritchett</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vive</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">steamvr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">creativity</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked With the graphics, unity engine, getting the hardware to work and design of the overall platform.", "Helped with drawing functionalities, image rendering, and voice recognition.", ""]], ["Tungsten.js Component Visualizer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Team name: Team 74 (if you're wondering, 74 is the atomic number of tungsten)\nTeam participants: Andrew Rota, Joe Zatkovich, Spencer Gregson, Kofi Owusu Acheampong, and Matt DeGennaro</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired primarily by a presentation given by Facebook engineer Jonas Gebhardt at React Europe on a work-in-progress project called Combine that focused on visual programming in React.

As part of the ELK stack (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana), it powers nearly all of the syslogging of our entire web service. Wayfair's heartbeat is effectively captured by these little bar graphs and line charts and are monitored 24/7 by our Frontline team to anticipate outages and react quickly and effectively. This technology is time tested and is worth its weight in gold. </p>\n<p>Its underlying architecture, Lucene, however, can do a whole lot more than just logging. Using its inverted index, it can power analytics, data modeling, and even generate recommendations! We decided to set out to prove this alternative use case for Elastic and are very pleased with the results</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is loaded with order data, search data, and customer data in order to produce heatmaps of SKU popularity, graphs of most popular terms, recommendations based on other customers searches, search clickthrough rate, real time fraud mapping, and anything else you can think of!!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started off with a simple elastic search cluster that was built out for the labs group, we built out some sample queries pulling from our orders, customers and loaded those in with kafka into logstash, and then into elastic. </p>\n<p>We also wanted to prove out the pipeline to move data from our big data HDFS clusters into elastic and built out a system that could geo-tag search IP's, track the products they clicked on, build up rudimentary search analysis, and then loaded the data directly into elastic search using python, and the elastic hadoop plugin.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Time series data is notoriously picky and we ran into that issue a lot. Because we were using customer click data, it was absolutely enormous and we had quite a time crunch on actually producing hive SQL that could run efficiently to load the index in time. Nick ran into a lot of issues configuring logstash to cooperate with his order queries directly from MSSQL. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It is honestly one of the coolest projects I've been a part of at Wayfair. The amount of business intelligence we can extract from these graphs and data correlations are still coming in as we're writing this (we just found out we 'accidentally' built a recommendations engine too). The data still needs to be sanitized a bit more before we present to the judges, but we're hoping that they'll see the value in this, and will also be just as excited as we are to leverage elastic search in our analytics stack more at Wayfair. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>So many gotchas with elastic, hive, logstash, and kibana configurations...

The VR community is growing rapidly, and we're hoping to eventually support accessories with more advanced gesture recognition.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Arcsign</h2>\n<p>We'd like to make it easier to crowdsource lesson creation, by making it easier to train gestures using recognition strategies such as algebraic cross-correlation and neural networks.

Using Wayfair's infrastructure also gives us the ability to build a powerful and user friendly bot.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It reads through your response and tries to determine what you might be searching for.\nExamples include typing in categories for something you would like or need.\n<strong>I would like a bed</strong> will give you the top bed results. \n<strong>Can you show me red beds?</strong> will show you the top red beds.</p>\n<p>There is also a passive <strong>Im feeling lucky option</strong> that will show you five random best selling products.</p>\n<p>Wayfair bot is not completely brilliant though and if it can't understand your response it will be sure send you a picture of an <strong>cat</strong> in order to help you relax!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it with Node.js, Express.js, and the Messenger Platform. We would have built it in PHP but since we had to have a public endpoint for our bot to hook into, it was best for us to spin up a Heroku instance since we weren't going to be pushing constantly to prod throughout the weekend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since we couldn't run our bot without a public endpoint we realized that we couldn't use the Wayfair codebase. We almost pivoted and attempted to make a bot that would just live on Wayfair.com but we all wanted to work with something new so we kept with using messenger.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>None of have ever worked with Heroku or the Messenger platform, and two of us never worked with Express before. So we're all very happy we were able to work with these new technologies and build out a bot that would easily be one of the better additions to the Facebook messenger platform.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The above explains this well. We also learned how the free Heroku tier is not something that we could ever use outside of building some toys like this bot. We would like to work with Google and AWS in order to compare each service in the future. Heroku is great in that it offers free tiers though and we are glad we were able to use this to build out our project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Wayfair Messenger Bot</h2>\n<p>Ideally this bot could be used to become very helpful also providing assistance to customer's with issues. This would could become a more user friendly way to help these user's solve their problems.</p>\n<p>Since we don't have access to pushing notifications until it's been reviewed we would also allow the bot to possibly push deals every once in a while to the customer. Account linking is also possible with the app, and if we link a user's account we can send specified products based on the user's shopping habits. Messaging apps are becoming much more personal than email and this could possibly have a more powerful impact than sending emails if this is done correctly.</p>\n<p>The wit.ai engine is also very powerful natural language processor and in the future incorporating this fully could provide a significant improvement.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">messenger</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">messenger-platform</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mayangithub/wayfairhackathon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mayangithub/wayfairhackathon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["WayMirror", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wayfair is a huge tech company selling everything for the home... that is except technology for the home. IoT is becoming an integral part of the household and if Wayfair wants to truley be the king of home then it seems obvious that home tech should be apart of Wayfair in some way. We understood from the beginning that Wayfair wasn't going to start making home tech devices to sell on their website but because IoT devices have become a popular area around the DIY community it seemed like a great idea for Wayfair to start open sourcing some awesome home technology projects that anyone could make (and maybe buy some Wayfair products to go along with it).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The WayMirror is a smart mirror powered by a raspberry pi. The pi is connected to a 10 inch lcd screen which sits behind a one way mirror inside a picture frame which gives the illusion of white images and text appearing seamlessly on the mirror itself. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We divded the work into two sections 1. python scripts which could run specific pi items such as bluetooth for playing music and the camera for allowing your mirror to take a picture of you and send it to your email with the push of a button connected to a gpio pin on the pi. 2. The java implementation handles all the UI modules that can be placed on the screen. These include calendar readings, weather forcast, clock, news articles, stock prices, and some wayfair specific modules for looking at products. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was having other things going on meant that Mark and I were not able to be in the same room when working on a good portion of the project. This made communication a bit difficult especially because a majority of the java implementation was done on a train.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Were very proud of all the work we accomplish over this weekend. This was a passion project of ours and were excited to make the code open source because it can greatly help other DIY creators to add on and make even cooler mirrors!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about the raspberry pi and how it functions along with its incredible capabilities. Were planning to use it in many side projects to come!</p>\n<h2>What's next for WayMirror</h2>\n<p>WayFridge? WaySpeakers? Wayfair IoT and much more!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">camera</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Goldilocks Browse", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Goldilocks Browse \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/395/553/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>In this shelf example, the user can navigate by changing the width and height. The plot shows all of the height-width combos available.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When I'm shopping, sometimes I know <strong>exactly</strong> what I want, and there are so many products out there that I am sure it exists somewhere. This inspired me to create a better way to search through existing products to find exactly what I wanted and get that satisfaction of receiving a custom-made item, without the time and cost of having something custom made.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Goldilocks browse shows a set of products that are all very similar, but differ in a few key attributes. The interface shows one item at a time. The user can then move through the products by indicating that they like the product but want it to be taller, shorter, wider, rounder, etc. for predefined key attributes of a product. The result is a view that looks like a stop-motion film as one product is replaced with the next.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The project involved building the data set of scaled, attributed product images and building the web interface. I gathered silhouette photographs and product attributes from Wayfair.com and processed them with Inkscape and Python scripts. I built the proof-of-concept web interface using a slideshow image viewer as a starting point.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The most interesting part of this project was coming up with a way to define the product \"nearest neighbors\" in the parameter space of key attributes in such a way that a user could navigate through it. In the end, I generated tables with one row per product and columns for product ID's of products that there were slightly-smaller and slightly-bigger along each attribute, as calculated with a Python script.</p>\n<p>For the visual display to have the stop-motion film look I was going for, I needed images of products with white backgrounds and from identical angles. In the future, it would be ideal to use 3D models of products to render out silhouette shots from identical angles and distances.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting three product examples up and running: industrial-style shelves, cylindrical glassware, and white plates. The white plates are particularly interesting because I used a \"roundness\" parameter to sort plates that range from circular to square.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This way of browsing can be very effective, but you need around 50 items to make it look good. It is the key attributes are orthogonal to one another -- in other words, that there are enough products so that you can change one attribute without also changing another attribute.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Goldilocks Browse</h2>\n<p>Next up is automation for scaling this up to many products. Automate the identification of groups of products that can be displayed in this type of widget. Automatically scrape the silhouette shots and skip products that do not have white background silhouette shots. It would be exciting to try a really densely populated product class with more than two key attributes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet
