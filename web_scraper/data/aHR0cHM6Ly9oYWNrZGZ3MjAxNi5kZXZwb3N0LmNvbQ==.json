There are many blind people who battle the frail navigation systems of a cane. To us, the sense of sight is taken advantage of and we don't realize the efforts that blind people must put in to survive through day-to-day actvities. There are many who feel out casted for looking and moving differently than others. Our device is meant to tackle this problem and allow technology to work with those who are blind and enable them to walk in confidence and without fear. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This device will allow blind people navigate through their daily lives and be ble to know when there are obstacles in their way. For our prototype, our device is able to tell the person when an object is getting near them(by increasing vibrator sensor frequency) and be able to know if they need to go up and down staircases. We also built parts to tell the user if there are obstacles or obstructions on their sides using glasses(however isn't fully implemented and explained why in the challenges ran into). </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Arduino and used C as its coding language. We also used a breadboard to connect to the arduino, sonar sensors (to detect objects and their distance away from the person), and vibrating motors(which will signal to the user when an obstacle is in their way). </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was battery power since all the sensors and motors took some charge and using the arduino, there wasn't much voltage that came along with it. Specifically when we tried to implement the glasses as sideview sensors, it would no longer work since there wasn't enough battery power to make the entire system work. Another challenge we ran into is making it user friendly in its convinience of weight and space. We had difficult to find spacy that fits the arduino, bread boards, and wires for this device as well as make it confortable for the user (however this challenge was combatted using a fanny pack style belt, making it stylish and fit for the device and user). </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are really proud at how well the vibrating motors work with the sonar sensors, as they are able to tell the person when an object is getting near us. Also figuring out depth perception of the floor was very difficult to figure out, but now we can notify the user when they need to go up stairs when needed. Of course the device detecting obstacles like walls and tables is another very important accomplishment. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use jumper wires with the breadboard and arduino as well as program in C. It was a nice advanture and we learned how to be patient with our technology so that they work with the user and not just the voltage. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Insight</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Latterization/Insight\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Latterization/Insight\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Initial prototyping for programming", "I worked mainly on the hardware design of the \"fanny pack\" and wiring/placement of the sensors and vibration motors on the belt and the glasses.

Whether for academic or personal reasons, they are reading articles, looking at pictures, and clicking hyperlinks. Users will often bookmark the pages they find interesting but rarely actually revisit the site. We made TL; DR to provide people an opportunity to develop a better understanding of what they've read in the past, to lock in concepts, and recall information more actively.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We provide a full system to annotate and view your bookmarks in an easy to read format. The first part of our system is a browser extension that allows a user to highlight any section of a webpage. The content (text and images) of this highlight are instantly uploaded to our backend and processed to be viewed on our web application. In our web app, we give you a selection for feeds based on the amount of time you have to study.</p>\n<p>If you have 5 minutes on a bus-ride, tap on the 5 minute button. You\u2019ll be sent a customized, summarized, and condensed feed of your bookmarks and notes that you can easily read and study in 5 minutes. Once you're done, you can exit for the next session, review entire original articles, or see the notes in context of the rest of your annotations.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The system has two parts: a chrome extension and a web app. The chrome extension leverages multiple jquery libraries and applied mathematics to allow for selection of html on the page based on the viewport and content. Once the HTML was extracted by the extension, we parsed and converted it to HyperText, allowing the text to be transferred to a Parse Database. Once the information was transferred to the Database, we iterate multiple updating processes to tag the data with necessities to summarize as well as a ranking system to lay out the learning sequence. Notes are pushed to the web app from Parse. For longer annotations and during shorter time-periods, we provide an automatic, lightweight summarization technique based on tf-idf (term frequency - inverse document frequency). This summarization gives you a readable-length summary of the notes to read on the go. When eventually combined with data from annotations across users, the cross-validation will allow for more recommended articles and more accurate summarizations based on what people highlight.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Summarization of text was troublesome because we could not support a heavyweight summarization technique, so we had to implement on what could be modular and processed quickly, while still giving a good summary of highlighted data. We also had to look into learning systems to figure out how we should display data and how the user\u2019s notes should be displayed if they select a single time option multiple times (i.e. if someone chooses a 30-second summary of their notes, they will get new summaries each time to maintain a fresh intake of information). Syncing everything across to the backend required ample debugging due to the onset of repeated highlights and poor formatting. We attempted to account for these problems as much as possible by providing an easy-to-read interface.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were excited when we knew that we had a cohesive entire system, from annotations to summarizations, implemented instead of just one part. We were also proud of creating something that we both will actually use and actually need on a daily basis (we solved one of our own problems, and hopefully others' too).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use TypeScript! We had to learn how also to efficiently utilitze tf-idf techniques to summarize text quickly. As well, pulling data from a webpage based on our highlighting tool was full of challenges that we had to google extensively and debug constantly to get right.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TL;DR</h2>\n<p>We want to implement a machine learning layer on the web application and database to allow for robust sharing of similar articles across all of our users. With more NLP features, such as keywords and concept tagging, we can provide users with even more resources to learn from - persisting their understandings of the world. By aggregating annotated data from all users, we can develop ML models to then factor into the summarization - we will know what people think is important to text, which is difficult to do with a context-independent summarization technique.</p>\n<p>We also want to provide more robust highlighting/annotating features such as tagging, multi-part selections (in the same note), customizable interfaces and generally just more options as we see fit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript\">typescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tf-idf</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Created the Chrome Extension and connected it to a Parse DB", "Worked on branding and worked on the aspects of the presentation.

The way we interact with these devices is using mobile applications which can be quite cumbersome, as we won't always have mobile devices with us. We wanted a technology which recognizes our commands through speech and understand our intent and act accordingly. How cool it will be to have a voice-controlled light bulb to follow your commands instead of the old and boring switches.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>HeyIlumi provides seamless voice interaction with Ilumi bulbs. It uses Natural language processing to analyze your speech and understand your intent and follow your commands. Imagine, you say 'HeyIlumi, I am in a romantic mood', and the bulb would change its lighting to suit a romantic mood.</p>\n<p>Wana hear more? You can also give a name to your bulb and let's say you are on your way to home and want to romantic mood already set, you can just tweet on your twitter profile and HeyIlumi will follow your commands. When you reach home, the ambience will be ready.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built an Android application which constantly listens for your commands to HeyIlumi. We used Google's Voice API for speech to text conversion and then applied NLP algorithms to fetch the intent. For the twitter integration, we used Twitter4j along with Java.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Ilumi bulbs have very limited flash memory and can only interact with Bluetooth. We faced issues when the Bluetooth strength was not full, due to interference of nearby devices. We had to tweak Ilumi's API a little to get our work done. The most important challenge was processing speech for supporting natural languages.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It was our first time interacting with a smart device (bulb) and it was a great experience. We got hands on experience using NLP algorithm. Our proudest accomplishment is building heyIlumi so smart, that it understands commands not only in a direct way (Turn blue) but also in an indirect way (I feel like being under the ocean).</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Programming application for Android device, Google voice API, twitter developer library and Natural Language Processing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HeyIlumi</h2>\n<p>Integration with more smart devices, like Android TV, Apple TV, Amazon Alexa</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">speech</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ilumi</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["PaperBakk", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PaperBakk \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/632/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Screenshot of Website Ebook Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PaperBakk \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/633/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Screenshot of Website Hompage</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PaperBakk \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/672/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PaperBakk \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/673/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PaperBakk \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/674/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PaperBakk \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/675/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We made a social media application and website based on books and those who read them.

What a rarity these days! A few days before HackDFW, I had the misfortune of my ever-fickle internet connection showing its hostility towards me and not working precisely the moment I had a huge project due, forcing me to seek the refuge in our school's computer lab. However, the fact the internet was down was not the biggest issue that disconcerted me. It was the fact that I waited four hours (really, four hours!) over the phone in order to talk to somebody who might be able to diagnose my chronic internet issues. Sometimes, my phone disconnected, and other times, something else happened, but after that incident I could not forget the Vivaldi's four seasons that played throughout that time of waiting, waiting, waiting. I was determined to find something that would minimize the chance that this happened to others.</p>\n<p>In a survey conducted by Time magazine, 71% of people polled were \"tremendously annoyed\" when they had to wait in order for customer support over the phone. The same survey brought into attention the fact that 86% of consumers report being put on hold every time they call a business, and that the average person spends 13 hours a year waiting on the phone. What a waste of time! If only somehow this situation can be mitigated... </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application (or rather, the set of applications) we created supports scheduling a phone call for the user such that it calls a number on behalf of the user, and removes the usability barrier of asynchronous menu options over the phone. We implemented natural language recognition to further streamline a SMS-based replacement service for these menus. This application has the potential to saves tens of minutes per month, if not hours, of users' time by scheduling and actually making phone calls on behalf of the user, and only calling back to the user (by transferring the call) when an actual customer support representative or human being picks up the phone. Our SMS interface makes menu options more convenient for customers. Over time, user responses map the entire tree of menu options.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Cisco's Tropo platform allowed us to automate phone calls and implement question answering. We take pride in getting our phone bot to communicate with another automated phone bot using DTMF. We hosted our Python application on Heroku and pointed Tropo's portal to our root endpoint, which allowed us to implement better architecture with control over our server side. Most of the time was dedicated in optimizing the Heruko server to accept such requests, as well as a artificial intelligence platform to get queries in a semi-automatic way. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We learned that transcribing messages takes non-real-time time, meaning we couldn't transcribe messages and then send users text messages and expect a response at the same time, making us restructure the code that had the prior assumption. We also ran into some trouble in creating the server that would host our software, specifically because of the unfamirilty between the primarily script-oriented platform.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that our server really works! We are especially proud of our mapping of NLP SMS to menu-based options.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to brainstorm about using an API to solve common problems and develop strong use cases for the product. And while building it, we learned to collaborate over creating several parts of a primarily server-side application.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Queueless</h2>\n<p>We may be able to develop it further to support more phone numbers, and advance the AI it uses. We also need to support free entry in automated phone systems, as well as authentication for sensitive information.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tropo\">tropo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cisco\">cisco</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BrianZhu1/AutoT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BrianZhu1/AutoT\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote Flask server, structured application, wrote REST helpers, wrote menu-mapping function", ""]], ["Rich Messaging System", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><em>I guess every one of these apps has to start with a tragic back story...</em> Once upon a time Robert had a girlfriend. She was a real girl: hair, mouth, eyes...eyebrows... a likeable 3D girl. Despite his nerdy disposition and geeky personality, she somehow liked him. Perhaps he was attractive in her eyes, or maybe she was actually interested in his flawless coding skills. They had met through a hackathon in Iceland, but after returning to their homes far away from each other, to talk, they used a messaging app. However, Robert encountered a problem. One day, his girlfriend texted him,\"Come back now\". He couldn't tell her tone of urgency through text, and soon, he was without a girlfriend. Alone. His inability to react to body language and feelings through text caused him to lose his girl.</p>\n<p>From Robert's depths of despair following his breakup came the birth of Rich Messaging System. With this app, Robert hopes that others will not suffer the same fate of miscommunication he did.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Rich Messaging System incorporates emotional tags such as sarcasm to better convey messages.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We split into two teams: one on front-end development, the other on the back end.

Front end development is annoying. We learned that uniting hardware and software isn't easy either.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rich Messaging System</h2>\n<p>We hope to incorporate human stimuli such as heart rate, breathing, body temperature, and tactile senses in order send messages more efficiently and accurately. We also hope to incorporate machine learning into our app to increase automation of certain input strings.

Clearly, the purpose of event organizers is to maximize the number of attendees in minimum possible efforts. This poses the challenge of advertising the event/show in reduced efforts.</p>\n<p>The idea behind our application \u2018Quick Post\u2019 is to broadcast the information about the event to span maximum number of people. However there are already existing applications such as Facebook which solve the similar problem but without the availability of internet and smartphones, purpose seems to be defeated. Our application, on the other hand, uses cellphone network as a medium of broadcasting, covering large amount of people. </p>\n<p>We have been able to achieve the aforementioned functionality using one of the cloud API \u2018TROPO\u2019 for the communication purposes. This application (messaging service) lets a user post/broadcast about the event with just a text message and people who have subscribed to this application will get notified about this event. Users who have already subscribed to any event in the past will get notified about the new event with the functionality of deciding whether they want to keep receiving such notifications. This lessens the burden of advertising an event on users. In this application, we have also categorized the events in multiple categories. For example, events such as Hackathon, Microsoft coding challenge would lie in the same category. This helps users to get the notifications only about the events in which a user in interested.</p>\n<p>In future work, we would add the functionality of reminding about the event to subscribed people. Moreover, users would also have the functionality of choosing events happening in certain area. In other words, users can subscribe events based on the location.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tropo-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Hands free call and text notifier ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>While studying phone calls and messages becomes distraction and to prevent that, it helps to know if checking phone at that moment is important or not.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Bulb glows to a specific color based on the incoming call which is either individual or added to a group.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using Android Studio, Telephony manager API and Ilumi bulb API</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Connecting the phone call state (Telephony manager) to bulb to execute at the same time</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ilumi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ilumi-sdk</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["KinOc Arena", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NH4NQOexpm0?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Learning and collaborating through VR/AR games.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Connects two users to perform a shared task in VR.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Used multiple Kinects to capture the two different model movements as well as relatively precise fist detection and fire shots with it.

Our device is intended to be used as a fashion accessory that will record any sudden movement that may indicate danger to one's health.

It proves to be difficult to collect snacks, and grocery purchases if you have no form of transportation.

We first attempted to use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read individual receipts to determine the total transaction price. That was an insane idea considering the time and other tasks we had to complete.\nWe then implemented into our backend a request based pricing scheme. As a purchaser I can decide whether or not to accept the price and item a receiver requests. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>In the very last few hours we were able to get most of the retrofit and django api's built into the app. This proved to be our greatest overcomed challenge because each individual on the team each worked with different softwares. Being able to finally integrate was a great feat.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Plan out your project <strong>way</strong> better next time. If we started from the begining with the request based system and implementing our server connections we would have been able to better design and develop each individual component of the service.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Shoppit</h2>\n<p>First, is probably restructuring code bases. Some parts of it don't consider certain use cases, simply because of the 24hr time constraint. \nSecond, is a deployment to college towns. By providing a service such as this to it's main audience we should be able to support the growth of the company.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["ourhack.dreaminfinitely.comJam Sesh", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ourhack.dreaminfinitely.comJam Sesh \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/466/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make an app that brings people in the local area together.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This web app allows a user to post if they want to have a jam session at their place.

My grandma had troubles with me, hopelessly beckoning me back to the safety and the comfort of the house. I, being a small child with little understanding of the world, oft ignored her pleas, in my own fruitless attempts to conquer nature. Yet my grandmother had one secret that kept me at my home. The aroma of her homemade cookies drew me from blocks away. The goowie chocolate chips brought bliss to my mouth. Her cooking made me domestic.</p>\n<p>Now, in this digital age, I found that the technological increases that dominate the twenty-first century more often than not unite us, bringing us closer on social media. I've watched with wonder as Facebook unites long-lost friends, and Twitter brings the Stars down to earth to be out neighbors. And now, recently, I feel confident that technology has advanced to such a point that I can express my own idea- that wholesome image of the kid eating the cookie. My goal is to bring this tranquility to the largest amount people as I can, and to humbly accept wherever this deed may take me, if it's only through one Hackathon or to the Highest Throne in Humanity, reserved only to the greatest thinkers and philosophers. Time will tell, but I will fulfill my own role ceaselessly, offering people a moment of peace through my homemade cookies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">flour</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sugar</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoa\">cocoa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">100%-organic-ingredients</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["E.g., I worked on the backend and cleaned up our landing page's CSS.

Until two weeks before the event we had no idea it even existed until a friend introduced us to it. What we came to realize is that this is a common trend with activities in the DFW Area. We wanted a way to explore the different communities and events in your local area while facilitating making new friends.</h2>\n<h2>What it does - Our app is a repository of events in your local area but more than that its centered around meeting new people. We realized that there may be events people want to go to but they may be unable to find others to go with  them....so we developed Accompany. It connects new people into groups based around their interests and events they're planning on attending.</h2>\n<h2>How we built it - Our app is built using the Android Studio IDE with java, SQlite, and the Google API</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into - Our main challenge in developing Accompany was learning how to develop an Android app. this was a first time experience for all the members of our team.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of - If learning to develop the Android app was our biggest challenge then it was also our greatest accomplishment. In the short amount of time at Hackathon we learned how to do a variety of different functions in an entirely new system of coding for our team.</h2>\n<h2>What we learned - We learned a lot about the design of a product as multiple times we had to go back to pen and paper and chart out how to connect the classes we designed. Overall this was a great experience in real world development of an idea outside of the classroom.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Accompany - While we are happy with our progress, we are looking forward to developing this even further in the next couple of months and hope to publish it on the Android marketplace by the end of the summer.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-geocoding\">google-geocoding</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["IDK Food", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>All of my friends who extremly indecisive.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Chooses a random restaurant nearby and gives you step by step directions to it.\nIt doesnt tell you what you chose until you arrive!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Google Play Services to get the current location and send it to the Yelp API to get a list of restaurants.\nOnce we randomly select one, with a given radius, we use Google Maps and Google Directions API to show step by step directions to the unknown restaurant.

So in the future we plan on implementing the lots for our school and there they can get a look at all the parking area. We have zones specifying where one can park so they can choose the zone they have and it will narrow down the map to areas in which they are able to park.

In many situations where a battery source is needed, it\u2019s not always simple to reach and change, there is a time consuming step process to take and might be repeated if there are branches or any other systems relying on a battery source. Due to the time consumption, costly upkeep, and work needed to continuously place these batteries, a system is desperately needed to eliminate the need for battery replacement, or lengthen the life of the battery itself.  With this in mind, we have designed a system to improve efficiency and lengthen the lifespan of a desired battery, and possibly eliminate the need for battery replacement. We achieved this goal by constructing a charging circuit to store and harness the maximum energy harvested from an alternative vibration power generator. For testing purposes and due to lack of resources right now, we used Arduino and a Bluetooth module to communicate wirelessly with an Android device to obtain feedback related to the battery status, in this case, the program is able to tell if the battery is within a range of 4 different charging percentages: 0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75% and 75-100%. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rectifier</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["UbiMirror", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UbiMirror \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/378/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Display 1</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UbiMirror \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/379/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Display 2</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UbiMirror \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/380/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Display 3</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UbiMirror \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/381/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sensors</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>UbiMirror</h2>\n<p>Equipped with motion, light, and weight sensors to turn the classic \"Magic Mirror\" into a smart mirror for your bathroom.

We had to make due wit what little variety of hardware that was offered at the even, which was fun as  it was a challenge. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The arduino, as the central unit of the project has multiple IR sensors which should be placed on key points on the home, when triggered will send data to the Tropo APi script to send a message or call to the owner of the home informing them of the triggered alarm system. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using the arduino, and the 1 sensor available at the hackathon to detect movement, we connected the IR sensor circuit to the Arduino and had the arduino programmed to return a numerical value in each of the IR sensors to tell the system which one was triggered for a better detailed report of what part of the home was breached. The IR sensors had to be built around resistors to prevent it from going up in flames, which we forgot at first and burnt one up, but we had very limited supplies as the resistors all disapeared a couple hours into the event, but luckliy someone carried their electrical circuits project from the university for some reason, and they had excess resistors. Give or take the resistors were not the correct resistance we needed, we ended up doing the math with multiple resistors to figure out the chain of resistors we needed for each resistor, whether it was putting them up in series or parralel to get the proper resistance we needed. After that, we connected the serial cable to the arduino and a laptop in order to send the data from the arduino out to the Tropo API. As there were no WIFI sheilds provided at the hackathon, the only way to send up the data to the tropo server would be through a computer, which we also wanted to swap for a RaspberryPi but we did not carry one with us,</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Lack of hardware for our big detailed idea of a project, so we had to cut things back, remove ideas, remove parts of the project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Managed to complete the majority of the project given the materials we had available.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>IR sensors and arduino code as well as API integration with python as we had never worke with these. </p>\n<h2>What's next for DIY security</h2>\n<p>A better implementation of the project using proper sensors and wireless connectivity.

The first is a mobile application environment which features a beautiful UI. The second interface we implemented to access the application is a text messaging bot. Simply, text <strong>FIND</strong> to find group events or <strong>HOST</strong> to host group events to <strong>213-438-9280</strong> (We change the number every now and then so it might not be updated after submission). The bot implements Tropo, our provided SMS platform, and Python as a backend language for routing user input to, Zapier, the backend framework. The app landing page was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we faced was implementing Tropo's Scripting API with a backend for two-way SMS exchanges. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Accomplishments that we're proud of include the creation of an amazing UI/UX for our mobile app interface as well as eventually implementing Tropo's API seamlessly into our application.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>During our experience we successfully distributed work among proper individuals based on experience and skill-set. Some of team members  learned how to use new technologies such as: UI design with Sketch, Python/Backend frameworks, and RestfulAPIs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for tagalong</h2>\n<p>We believe tagalong has the potential to successfully eliminate a pervasive issue among demographics that find meeting new people to not be an easy task.

For example, a student may be accepted into two very different schools. The first being large university with international recognition, the other, a smaller private liberal arts college without the same recognition, but with a more regional focus. How do you and your student pick the \u201cbest\u201d one? </p>\n<p>A major percentage of students who aspire would be working and would have no time to research on the university or the course. They will have to believe the consultant  or friends or family who have studied in that university (what are the odds). There is a wide information barrier. The consultants charge a lot of money for stale and useless(sometimes wrong) information. Also the international students don't have the luxury of campus walks through. Even if the aspiring student has time and does research, it should be in the right direction. Existing online Platforms, forums and blogs  like quora or stupidsid.com require a lot of time, effort and patience to get reliable information about the university or course.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>UniKonnect aims to bridge that gap by bypassing the third party; it connects aspiring students directly to students of the institution they wish to gain admission to.

Investments are made based more on intuition rather than market analysis and historical trends. To solve the woes of the investors, we have developed an application that accurately tracks the performance of the stock of a company. It also finds the correlation </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Stockly provides a one stop solution for the investors who wish to make an exponential gain in the stock market. It accurately tracks the stock performance of the company and sends out signals on real-time basis to buy or sell a particular stock. It also finds the sentiment of the stock in the social media and makes a correlation between the stock prices and user sentiments which further makes the recommendation more accurate. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The application can be segregated into two parts. The first part analyses the social network data. Real-time twitter feeds are collected for the desired company and user sentiments are calculated using Natural Language Processing. A positive score indicates a high potential for positive growth and vice versa. The second part of the application deals with the actual historical stock prices. Exponential smoothing curves are generated using Holt-Winters algorithm to predict the stock prices on a running window basis. The last step is making a correlation between the two data pipelines and making a recommendation to the end user that maximizes the profit on investment.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating the multiple technologies into a single application and further deploying it in AWS was the biggest challenge. Initially, we chose R programming as our primary language for analysis, but we had to change the platform completely because of the limitations in scalability and deployment. As a result, we had to re-write the entire back-end in Node.js. Another challenge we ran into was cleaning the data from API's and removing data inconsistencies to make an accurate time-series model of the stock. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Despite several integration problems that we ran into, we were able to integrate and host the application on AWS. Right from the beginning, we had managed the work and allocated timelines for each task and that helped in incorporating disparate domains such as data science and web design, software development. We ensured smoother communication and file sharing through Slack and it gave us a unique experience in making quick decisions in limited time which is often the case in real-projects.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Node.js was one technology which was relatively new to most of us. We also learnt the benefits of having a work-breakdown structure to solve complex problems in smaller chunks. Each of us being from a diverse background got to learn how contribution from one improved the output of another and taking the functionality of the application to a whole new level.</p>\n<h2>What's next for <a href=\"https://github.com/dfwcrew/stock-analyzerjs\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/dfwcrew/stock-analyzerjs</a></h2>\n<p>We wish to take this application to the next level by implementing a SMS feature.

In order to get to the stop we have to go through a neighborhood for five minutes and it takes five minutes to leave. As we arrived at the stop the student wasn't even on the bus and therefore we wasted 10 minutes just trying to drop off a student who wasn't even their. after that Ic are up with the idea and expanded on it to make it what it is today</p>\n<h2><strong>What it does</strong></h2>\n<p>SIT\nDesign:\nWelcome to SIT. The interactive application that allows the educational system to become more reliable and organized, such as bus management. This is a lucrative market as a great majority of the schooling system are insufficient in terms of maintenance, which in turn impacts the community in general . With this innovative idea, we plan on incorporating proximity sensors and BLE within the user\u2019s identification device so the bus may automatically recognize that the user has entered. These sensors will be connected to our app, so that the user can determine whether they will be attending the bus or not. Not only does this idea benefit the bus and educational industry, but it entitles opportunities for many more emerging industries as well. One other example of how beneficial the incorporation of proximity sensors is in the user\u2019s identification device is to assure attendance within the classroom. Often, taking attendance within the classroom can be very hectic, especially with bigger classes. The solution to this problem is to eliminate the root of the problem, which is the attendance program. Instead, if users use the identification device provided to them, we can automatically mark the student present the moment they walk into the classroom. Each classroom will have a Bluetooth device, such as a Mac or an iPad, that will recognize the sensor. We can connect the attendance with the teacher or professor through our app, so they can double check to ensure there are no faults. This will fix multiple problems the education system has, such as skipping class. It will also teach scholars to be more responsible and disciplined, as they must carry their identification at all times. However, if the scholar should forget their identification device, they can always check into the classroom through the application included within the program on their personal device. \nThe identification device itself will be powered by a BLE device. A BLE, or Bluetooth Low Energy, is a small powerful chip that allows a shorter amount of data to be sent, such as sensor data, using a low amount of power consumption. The benefit of a BLE over a traditional Bluetooth chip is that the BLE is cheaper and smaller, so it will be more beneficial towards this cause. Not only that, but due to it\u2019s low power consumption, the chip will last well over a year, which already surpasses its original need. The chip itself will be powered by a 20mm Coin Cell Battery. This battery will give more than enough power to the chip, and is relatively cheaper than the alternate options. \nBLE Module RN-42</p>\n<p>Price*: Average $18.95 per unit</p>\n<p>Coin Cell Battery</p>\n<p>Price*: average $1.95 per unit\n*Price may vary by quantity and manufacturer</p>\n<h2>** How I built it**</h2>\n<p>Due to the fact that Im not a skilled programmer, I used a software called app demo store which allows me to make and simulate an app on my phone for my idea. With this if I wan't to make it real I am able to take the code forms eh software and put it into a real app. </p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges I ran into</strong></h2>\n<p>I originally was gonna use flinto to make the app but ran into some challenges with the software. Then while working a friend of mine pointed out the lack of technology for this idea. But thankfully after some research we found technology which exists to make this idea come true.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SIT (Student Identification Tracker)</h2>\n<p>We hope to take this idea to a developer, get some advice, some opinions from school districts, and hopefully make this idea come to life.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">appdemostore</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["NetDeckWins", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We saw an opportunity where we could help a user quickly find a way to the top. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user enters in their cards, using our auto-completing search bar, along with a powerful expansion pack feature. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Node.JS, Angular.JS, and Git Version Control. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We started out attempting to use the React Framework.

We analogize this to the opinions of college students. While we were too late to retrieve the Democratic Debate yaks because they are recycled on a daily basis, we found that analyzing the yaks even after the debate produced statistically significant trends about not just individual campuses, but about yik yak users as a whole.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We scraped each individual Yak after reverse-engineering the Yik Yak Web API, analyzed it semantically utilizing Alchemy's Watson Contextual Analysis to produce the lexicographical model, and plotted these campuses using AmCharts and associated them with the generated keywords.We hosted the database for the sentiment using MySQL, used a MAMP framework, and used Alchemy API for natural language processing.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>freaking maps</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Actually producing a comprehensible data model that somebody can analyze without having a background in Data Science or Analytics.

We thought to take this further, and build a game around it. We then tried to think of what makes games popular, and what keeps people playing them. Well, repeatability is one common factor, so that's the direction we tried to go by making this game a clicker.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You spawn with a little sprite holding a shovel, and you click as fast as you can to dig through the earth. You start out on the top crust, and have to dig through layers of dirt, rock, and then magma, and then the whole thing back in reverse as you exit the other side of the Earth. It ends with you breaking ground on the other side, and falling out since gravity has now switched, giving it a nice little humurous ending.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it as a flash game using the game desiging software Stencyl. It's drag-and-drop visual programming language made for easy and quick work.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge that we faced was the inital start of the game, since we weren't really sure what medium to use to develop the game. We tried messing around with Swift and Xcode, Python and Tkinter, but Stencyl was unparralled in ease of use and fluidity.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This was the whole team's first Hackathon, and so we were honestly apprehensive that we would even have any sort of finished product to show the Judges. Just getting here, coming up with an idea, and creating a product, albeit simple, is extremely satisfiying, and something we're all going to hold onto forever.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that one day is not a lot of time at all to build something completely new, and that we do not know nearly as much as we think we do! We also learned that there is always going to be someone better than you, someone working harder, and if you don't constantly try and push yourself to your limits, you're going to get left behind.</p>\n<h2>What's next for planeTunnel</h2>\n<p>Honestly we had a ton of fun creating this, and had plans for a lot more features that had to be scrapped due to time constraints. In the future I see us flushing the game out, spending more time on graphics and maybe adding a sort of third-person 3D perspective. Eventually even, maybe we'll develop the game into a full app!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stencyl</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/actionscript\">actionscript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flash\">flash</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rugsandbrains/planeTunnel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rugsandbrains/planeTunnel\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["IlumiTherapy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IhmKaYmkKGg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"IlumiTherapy \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/378/154/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Research</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As a society that is exposed to artificial light more often than natural light, various conditions can arise due to the disruption of the circadian rhythm (sleep cycle). When light enters through the eyes, signals are sent to the brain in order to produce hormones that tell our body when to sleep and when to wake up. The human body runs on its own clock. A body clock synchronized with daytime and nighttime is essential for a healthy life. An unbalanced sleep cycle can lead to different disorders. Even the lack of light at specific times of the day can lead to the development of psychological or sleep disorders. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>IlumiTherapy is a phone application that works with the Ilumi LED Smartbulb. The Ilumi bulb serves as a source of phototherapy or light therapy for patients. A list of conditions and disorders is provided in the app, and once the patient selects what they are suffering from, they can begin their light therapy. After providing the user with instructions and a description on how it will work, the therapy will begin for the patient at the designated time and with the designated colors. With IlumiTherapy, the patient does not have to worry about when to use light therapy or about the intensity of the light-- with lightboxes, patients have to control everything themselves. IlumiTherapy monitors all of that for the patients. IlumiTherapy sets light scenarios to specific schedules, which are different depending on the condition. The conditions we currently treat include, but are not limited to: Seasonal Affective Disorders (aka \"winter blues\"), Dementia/Alzheimer's, Type 2 Diabetes, Circadian Rhythm Disorders, Insomnia, Shift Maladaptation Syndrome (from night shift work), and Jet Lag. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>IlumiTherapy was built on Android using the Ilumi SDK. We built the app from just a sample app and wrote all of the Java code and XML layouts from scratch.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Ilumi does not supply documentation for their SDK. Additionally, due to the SDK being in a JAR file, we could not view the implementation. Because of this, we had to navigate around any errors we encountered on our own, even going as far as reimplementing some broken SDK methods.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our first major hurdle and achievement was simply getting the Ilumi to connect to our Android app. We were provided with working connection code late in the hackathon, so we had to really push ourselves to get the connection to the bulb working on time.</p>\n<p>Turning the light on and off, and then to different colors seemed to be broken in the SDK. We reimplemented some of these methods ourselves.</p>\n<p>We are very proud of the possible impact of this app. With light therapy being an emerging field in medical science, we firmly believe that an app of this sort combined with hardware like the Ilumi could be truly beneficial to patients suffering from a wide array of illnesses.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that even with technical challenges, it can be extremely beneficial to ourselves as developers to work with hardware that we're not familiar with or encounter problems with. In industry, one does not always have the choice of what hardware or software that they work with.</p>\n<p>Time constraints taught us how to rapidly prototype an idea even if the UI/UX is not perfect.</p>\n<h2>What's next for IlumiTherapy</h2>\n<p>We hope to incorporate more disorders to IlumiTherapy, as well as increase it's accuracy on the time, duration, and colors of the therapy sessions. We also want to add a tracker where the patient rates how they felt that day; IlumiTherapy monitors if they used light therapy that day. With this feature, the patient can check whether IlumiTherapy is being effective in their case. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ilumi-sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the information displayed in the Android app, and helped out a little bit in the beginning with interfacing with the Ilumi light bulb.", "", "", "", ""]], ["Glove Controller", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Glove Controller \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/277/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Glove Controller</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Glove Controller \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/274/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Part 2) This combination toggles ON and OFF between the outer and inner LEDs.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Glove Controller \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/275/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>This finger combination blinks all four LEDs ON and OFF.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Glove Controller \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/276/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Part 1) This combination toggles ON and OFF between the outer and inner LEDs.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Glove Controller \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/278/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Glove Controller design implemented onto the glove.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The ability to control systems at your fingertips. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We wanted to construct a versatile circuit design that could control multiple components such as LEDs and motors.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We began by acquiring a glove, arduino, and a breadboard.

Which we love. Unfortunately, our cardiovascular systems do not. The dreaded <em>Freshman 15</em> await those who maintain a sedentary lifestyle, a tragedy which no one deserves to be a victim of, but few actively avoid.\nSo we love the Internet, but that love can be a little costly for our health. What could we use to incentivize activity? Something we hate, <em>very</em> much. Pop-ups. Now if walking could make those pop-ups go away...no more sitting still if you want to watch your 15th binge-spree episode of Friends.\nAnd as you take your walk and watch your shows (or do your project you've had weeks to do in the day before it's due), you'll enjoy not only better health (lower life insurance premiums anyone?), but increased cognition and creative thinking ability. Able to get your work done faster, we'll be able to design even more effective hamster wheels, which will increase our intelligence even more, and the feedback loop of superintelligence will allow us to TAKE OVER THE WORLD!</p>\n<p>p.s. We'd like to thank our giant hamster overlords for not eating us, as they sometimes do to their children.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>As the user walks on the treadmill, the wheel turns a motor that produces an electrical signal. The signal is then read by the Arduino and fed into our Processing program. The voltage from the motor is used to gauge the speed the user is walking at. As a result, the Processing program displays a set number of pop-ups depending on the voltage output from the motor. As the user walks faster, the voltage increases and the number of pop-ups decreases. As the user walks slower, the voltage decreases and number of pop-ups increases to encourage them to walk faster. This system encourages users to walk at an accelerated pace, ensuring that they are at least maintaining their starting level of fitness. It also provides a working surface for a computer, writing, or anything else you may find yourself using a desk for.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The inspiration behind the form of our device comes from an Instructable, and we used the base of those plans to get our design off the ground. Given the tools we had at the Dallas Makerspace, we had to significantly modify the design to allow it to be made in in 24 hours and also be structurally sound to survive 20 miles of transit by car. Using SolidWorks, we designed most of the parts to be cut by a computer-controlled router table. This not only saved us time which we needed to drill the 300 holes and cut the 48 slats that makes up the walking surface, but gave us the ability to design the wheel with flair and beautiful curves.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>-delaying bandwidth - the original plan for the hamster wheel. \n-transporting the wood\n-transporting the wheel\n-getting the wheel inside</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>-Completing a massive electromechanical project in a day\n-The aesthetic design of the wheel\n-Making something which is obviously useful for any working person\n-Learning a heck of a lot about sensor feedback\n-Did we mention building a HUGE HUMAN HAMSTER WHEEL!?</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>-4x8 plywood is VERY heavy\n  -Automated machines aren't always better than doing things the old fashioned way (Trying to 3D print wheels for the large hamster wheel to roll on wasted a lot of our time)\n  -Network routing is a bit more complicated than we thought\n  -An 86 inch wooden circle is actually very large\n  -Coordinating code, electrical, and mechanical construction is very difficult, especially when workplaces are 20 miles apart</p>\n<h2>What's next for MXMC</h2>\n<p>We have this enormous hamster wheel now--next, we want to take advantage of the electrical side, and use real-time sensor feedback and the cloud to keep a metric of a person's activity, and therefore their overall health. This could be tied into an app which communicates this information to an insurance agency, which could positively adjust a user's insurance premiums, track physical therapy progress, or anything else involving walking data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">instructables</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wood</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mechanical-design</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Concerted", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Concerted \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/033/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>grouplove</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Kygo had a show with wristbands that flashed in time with the music.

We wanted to come at this project from a different perspective, instead of us making an app that makes us and others laugh, why not make something that genuinely helps people. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app helps streamline the process of lives potentially being saved by having the victim call the dispatcher and through whit.ai. Dispatch automatically autofills into the dashboard in where the dispatcher can then go ahead and make any additional edits if necessary and dispatch ambulances, firetrucks, &amp;/or police units. We intentionally have the dispatcher still monitor the dashboard because we strongly believe that humans feel more comfortable talking to other humans especially is times of need. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used ALOT of things haha, some of them being node.js, express.js, recast.ai, swift, and more.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Theres never enough time, we always under estimate the time it takes to fix unexpected problems and communication will always be key, at some parts of the night, we lacked this heavily mostly due to the fact that this was a new challenge for us.</p>\n<p>Fun fact, CocoaPods has a huge bug. If you name your project \"Dispatch\" or really anything that uses its namespace, cocoa pods destroys your projects. That was a fun 3 hours... </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting most of the app complete for judges to at least take a look at and genuinely appreciate. What really made us happy was how the app we created this year genuinely helps people and could potentially lead to other major solutions is this field. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that teamwork really does make the dreamwork. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Dispatch</h2>\n<p>More artificial intelligence as well as better natural language processing. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pusher\">pusher</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rabbitmq\">rabbitmq</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wit-ai\">wit.ai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">recast.ai</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapkit\">mapkit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kickin-designs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">alamofire</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sketch-3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">zeplin.io</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/idappthat/Dispatch-React\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/idappthat/Dispatch-React\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/idappthat/Dispatch-iOS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/idappthat/Dispatch-iOS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/idappthat/Dispatch-Backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/idappthat/Dispatch-Backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Big Data, Big Feels", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Big Data on Reddit</h2>\n<p>With this project, you can look at how a subreddit reacts to different posts. This allows you to find the general attitude of a large group of people toward a subject passively. Then this same data can be used to find out which sites are posted more for negative content versus positive. It can also be used to find the general mood of a subreddit at any given time. This would allow a news site to not only look at which subjects provoke the largest response from users but also determine the best time to publish it. By using this data smartly, a news site can know when, what, and where to publish any given article for the largest viewership. Plus, because of the way reddit is structured, a news aggregator with a large and active userbase, it is easy to extrapolate this data to the reddit population as a whole using the demographic data of reddit. This would allow the attitude of a large population to be quickly determined on breaking news. It takes away the need to poll and sample opinions as often and lends itself to finding the popular opinion quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p>The goal is to later add a database to save the sentiment of all the posts and to also get a better NLP so that more comments can be run though at a time. This would allow for a better sample and would also allow for more analysis to be done, such as finding the key words in a post title that lead to more exposure. It would also allow for me to cross-reference the sentiment of a post to its newspaper on large sample, and therefore determine the overall semtiment that a newspaper displays on certain subjects.</p>\n<p>In all, this is a small project that, given time to create a good API and an increased budget for access to better APIs (the ones I'm using now are slow because they're free), could allow for anyone to scrape reddit for the data they need to optimize their release.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/anmousyon/python/news\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/anmousyon/python/news\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["KeepUp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"KeepUp \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/182/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Homepage of KeepUp</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"KeepUp \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/181/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Example of deleted video being downloaded through a torrent</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"KeepUp \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/258/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A restricted Youtube video</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>KeepUp</h1>\n<p>The anthesis to take-down requests, KeepUp tracks a list of YouTube videos removed from things like alleged copyright infringement, country-wide censorship, and deletion.

By bringing a friendly competitive aspect to a simple task such as recycling we hope to get people more involved in greener habits.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our hack consists of three parts: an IoT recycling bin, an iPhone application, and a web platform. By tagging your unique QR code at the recycling bin and tagging items, your repeated recycling will tally points. Once you have completed a tag, your points are synced seamlessly to the cloud and your score is updated on the leaderboards.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wanted to use some new technologies when exploring our hack so we decided to go with NodeJS for our cloud application. Our IoT recycling bin uses an Ingenu rACM to give us a low power solution which also could be deployed anywhere there is coverage. Computer vision was on our radar and was used to implement our barcode scanners.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Because there were a lot of moving pieces with our hack, a challenge was definitely getting all of the parts to play nicely with each other. The hardware we used for our IoT recycling bin was limited in performance and thus the frame rate can be slow at times for barcode detection.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to complete the entire hack end-to-end within the time limit! We are also very proud of being able to combine a multitude of technologies to produce an idea that encourages beneficial habits.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a great deal about computer vision, NodeJS, and iOS. We also learned about working together as a team and integrating pieces of the same solution that were built by different people.</p>\n<h2>What's next for RecycleWars</h2>\n<p>This hack was really fun to do in the short run, but we also believe it to have some potential for further work. Something like this could be a great way for families, companies, and even entire cities to get encouraged to be \"green\".</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mean\">mean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ingenu</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iot</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://198.199.73.107:8888\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://198.199.73.107:8888\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>198.199.73.107</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["SIM", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SIM \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/113/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SIM \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/114/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SIM \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/115/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Team:</p>\n<p>Shravan Patel\nBen Carter\nDaniel Johnson\nSiddhant Sahoo\nVidit Bhatt</p>\n<p>Special Thanks:</p>\n<p>Shannon Nguyen</p>\n<p>Hack Idea:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Develop an immersive gameplay experience for Elite: Dangerous.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Idea Development:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>The chair is intended to be a simulation chair motored by 30 amp window motors from old vehicles for affordablility. We implemented double joystick controls to maximize the accessibility of a spaceship in space; the user would not have to move their hands while wearing the Oculus Rift. This also allows us to accommodate for both translational and rotational controls. The simple design of the joystick chair allows the user to have full control of the game at their fingertips. A voice control feature was designed to enhance usability, so the focus will be on flying the spaceship rather than on specific controls.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Design:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>To achieve our intended gameplay experience, we incorporated various peripherals to enhance aspects of the user experience. The Oculus Rift is already supported by the game. In addition to the Oculus Rift, we facilitated player immersion by engineering our own joystick chair. The joystick chair features two, three-axis joy sticks and two window motors for two different degrees of freedom of movement which are fed ~30 amps. During the time we worked on our hack, we ran into a plethora of issues with our joystick chair. The issues being:\n\n-Gears made of poly-carbonate needed to be custom modified for stability.\n-Had trouble finding a power supply that provided for adequate movement for the motors.\n-Had five mosfets explode.\n-Finding alternatives for the mosfets.\n-Motor broke.\n-Motor shaft broke, but was ultimately resolved.\n-Biggest problem is making a robust motor controller, which we needed better equipment I.e. relays/higher amp     \n     mosfets\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hardware-and-software</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Helped heavily in hardware and interfacing", "Mastermind behind the original idea.

For example, if I wanted to learn a programming language, there are numerous sites that provide sets of lessons however every lesson is not created equal. If one site does an incredible job of explaining a concept but poorly describes another, one is left to fend for themselves to find additional sites to gain further insight. One may consider it beneficial to be able to have a concept explained different ways and in slightly different contexts, and by aggregating diverse resources we can accelerate the learning process by eliminating wasted time one would spend searching for supplemental material. With this in mind, PoD's goal is to take a topic like Python, decompose it into subtopics such as Variables, Functions, Classes, Multiprocessing Frameworks, Database Drivers, etc., link resources that directly relate to each subtopic's concept, and finally crowd source the quality of each resource based on it's effectiveness at clearly communicating the concept.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>PoD employs a standard three layer architecture, consisting of a No-SQL \"wide column\" database which is exposed to the world via a RESTful API that is (tentatively) consumed by Angular Javascript. Ideally, a graph-based database would be more suited towards this application, however due to the time constraints and the team's familiarity with Cassandra, we opted to forgo it for this iteration. Additionally, the three layer architecture will allow us to have the option to expose the API to the public.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>With such a complex task at hand, the most challenging part of this Hackathon was determining what requirements we could deliver for this iteration. Another challenge we faced was the intrinsic organic complexity of the vision. It was difficult to realize graph relations in a non-graph based database, and much time was spent determining an effective mapping of the data model and implementing basic database operations on the mapping.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>HackDFW has given us the opportunity to lay significant ground work for future development. We were able to effectively communicate our ideas to each other despite varying backgrounds and design philosophies. </p>\n<p><strong>Things we accomplished:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>  Developed a Conceptual Model</li>\n<li>  Built a Database Schema from the Conceptual Model</li>\n<li>  Implemented a RESTful API to expose the Database</li>\n<li>  Designed and Integrated an AngularJS Interface to interact with the API</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Due to the diverse set of skills that each team member has, everyone was able to learn various concepts from one another and has gained invaluable teamwork experience that we may not have had to chance to experience anywhere else.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pathways Of Discovery</h2>\n<p>Elaboration on technical details seems almost futile at this point due to the pending analysis of our current implementation. However, many members of the team are interested in continuing to collaborate in order to see a more polished, prim, and proper version be produced.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maven\">maven</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cassandra\">cassandra</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nginx\">nginx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dropwizard.io</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dropwizard</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pathwaysofdiscovery\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pathwaysofdiscovery\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pathwaysofdiscovery.online/#/main\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.pathwaysofdiscovery.online/#/main\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.pathwaysofdiscovery.online</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Service layer coding, database work, conceptualization and design support.", "I maximized this opportunity to learn from three talented developers.

As our potential ideas racked up, we had no tool to organize discussions about ideas, determine which ideas were most supported in the team, or quickly determine how viable our ideas were.</p>\n<h2>What it Does? (Or, how can Scheme help develop <strong>your</strong> Evil Plans?)</h2>\n<p><strong>Scheme</strong> is design-first brainstorming. Unlike our competitors, we approached our application from the top-up: our primary question was: \"how can we make brainstorming intuitive and simple?\"</p>\n<p>Anyone can create a team on the <strong>Scheme</strong> website. Once they input a team name, they're given a link to share with their teammates. Anyone with the link can register and begin contributing to the team page.</p>\n<p>On the team page, there is an interactive list of Scheme names (Idea names) on the right. Here, users can select which Schemes they'd like to see more information about, and \"favorite\" schemes that they like.</p>\n<p>Members of the team can also easily add their own Schemes (potential ideas) by pressing the \"+\" button in the top right corner of the app. This brings up a sleek and straightforward form to input a name and description for the new Scheme.</p>\n<p>Finally, when one clicks on an Scheme idea, they're presented with the full description of the scheme and a comments section, which they instantly contribute to at any time.</p>\n<h2>So, how did we build <strong>our</strong> Scheme?</h2>\n<p>We built Scheme in Ruby on Rails version 5.0. This gave us access to real-time updating via Websockets and easy deployment on Heroku. For the frontend, we used Semantic UI, HAML, Coffeescript, and SASS. Finally, we used Postgresql on the backend to store information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into?</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was creating a sleek design that worked on different browsers. A significant portion of our time was spent creating an application layout that could be displayed accurately on many devices.</p>\n<p>We overcame this challenge by keeping a tight-integration between designers and developers, with constant feedback after every change in the design or the frontend code.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of creating a fully-designed and functional MVP in 24 hours. We are confident that our product will help the Hackathon community grow in the future, and take pride in that.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We primarily learned about how to work with new team members, and how to manage a workflow between developers and designers. Many of us either hadn't worked on large projects with others, or weren't familiar with the heavy connection between development and design. This hackathon sharpened all of our skills because it gave us an opportunity to gain more experience with real-world software development and team management.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Scheme</h2>\n<p>We want to grow Scheme by partnering with Hackathons around the nation and giving even smaller development teams the ability to simplify their brainstorming process. Our next goal is to begin acquiring revenue by partnering with enterprise companies who need brainstorming and management software for larger teams (with upwards of fifty people).</p>\n<p>On the development side, our aim to convert Scheme's stack to one that takes better advantage of Websockets by implementing ActionCable. We also plan to upgrade Scheme's frontend by implementing it in Ember.js as opposed to jQuery.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

We wanted both customers, businesses, and wait staff to benefit from this new technology.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Restronaut decreases table turnaround time by an estimated 35%<em>. It does this by removing the biggest waiting periods of a visit. There are many times that you are waiting on the waiter, such as when you are ready to order or ready for the check. With a projected 6.1 billion smartphone subscriptions estimated by 2020</em>*, it is the perfect time to start rolling out large scale platforms such as this.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created the customer experience with an android app that connects to the Firebase server. The user connects to the database through an NFC chip that would be on the restaurant's table. Or, if the customer did not have NFC, they would enter the code printed on the NFC chip.</p>\n<p>Payments are handled through Stripe so that we do not save any sensitive information. This allows for point to point encryption for extra security.</p>\n<p>We created a website made with Angular and Ionic that links to the same Firebase that displays customers orders as they are made. This would be what the kitchen staff see.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We had issues implementing a gallery like view into Android but ended up solving it soon after.</li>\n<li>There was trouble in implementing Stripe payment gateway and we ended up having to not use that.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating an app that can manage orders and send them to kitchen staff.

It would be really nice if this app could provide a platform for users to update professor info and maybe even share advice with their fellow colleagues about course rigor. However, this is not necessarily a professor rating app. I intend for this to familiarize students with their professor's interests and research. It would then be more convenient to make classes and schools searchable rather than randomized. </p>\n<p>Credits:\n<a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/files/DecoTower1280x800.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/files/DecoTower1280x800.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty</a>\n<a href=\"http://previews.123rf.com/images/apostrophe/apostrophe1310/apostrophe131000006/22507614-abstract-orange-background-peach-color-elegant-warm-background-of-vintage-grunge-background-texture--Stock-Photo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://previews.123rf.com/images/apostrophe/apostrophe1310/apostrophe131000006/22507614-abstract-orange-background-peach-color-elegant-warm-background-of-vintage-grunge-background-texture--Stock-Photo.jpg</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Sonar Navigation Belt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmGpd_iLqpE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sonar Navigation Belt \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/376/631/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sensor case design</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sonar Navigation Belt \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/376/632/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>App screenshot</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sonar Navigation Belt \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/376/633/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Navigation belt (topside)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sonar Navigation Belt \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/376/634/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Navigation belt (right side)</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Team members Gustavo and Lucas have been doing research in wearable devices and a recent trip \nto a previous hackathon helped our team form new device ideas that could assist blind people with day to \nday activities. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The belt uses sonar sensors to detect nearby objects and sends the corresponding results to your android \ndevice.

With the Tails Management Platform, users can easily provision and manage a web server from Tails, all while maintaining their privacy.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Tails Management Platform integrates with Tails by extending its ability to manage persistent data (something Tails does very frugally as it is designed to be run from a flash drive and leave no trace on the host computer) in a sense similar to how most people have different email addresses for work and personal use.

Although the platform is nice, the mixture of Ansible and Shell script for Onion Service provisioning could be better handled through managing Ansible modules though Python.

Why? They cost universities between $50,000 and $75,000 to upkeep just under 200 of them annually. Although a majority of calls came from prank calls or flat tires, many calls came from medical crisis', car accidents, and crime reports, and these polls gave students a sense of security and safety on their campus. Personally, just seeing the blue-light near by while walking home at night made me feel safe.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>BlueLight is the mobile app to replace campus security and police polls used for emergencies. It makes the cost of \"upkeep\" next to nothing compared to thousands of dollars for the polls, it made the blue-light polls mobile, and it creates a net of security across your university.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Blue-Light</h2>\n<p>We would love to see BlueLight on our campus, the University of Colorado Boulder, and of course at other campuses across the country. We truly believe, although the original blue-light emergency phone polls are being taken down, there should still be some form of security that resembles these blue-lights.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapkit\">mapkit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/core-animation\">core-animation</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jessalbarian/HackDFW\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jessalbarian/HackDFW\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Scraped internet for schools, websites, addresses, global coordinates, phone numbers, and much more.", "", ""]], ["six tune", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"six tune \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/376/391/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My partner loves to jam, but hates the tedious process of tuning each string of his guitar individually, so we created a solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Traditional tuners require the user to pick one string and tune it before moving onto the next, ours lets you strum once and tells you which strings need to be tuned and which they need to be tuned.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used angular.js coupled with html5, vanilla javascript and the web audio API to harness the capbabilities of html5.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We were challenged processing the signals from the guitar strums into six distinct harmonics to then be able to analyze.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bower\">bower</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://sixtune.conradhappeliv.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sixtune.conradhappeliv.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sixtune.conradhappeliv.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the project's user interface", "DSP, some front-end work."]], ["Med Hub", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration behind our project is the need for emerging tech in the health industry.  Our team often tackles medical problems at hackathons to serve a social good, and we knew we wanted this project to be no different.  The inspiration behind this project truly comes from the passion for learning on top of personal experiences.  One of our team members spent about a week in the hospital last summer and she noticed that the way the doctors and nurses communicated about change in medicine prescriptions, dosages, and treatment options was disorganized.  This Smart Medical Cabinet and software suite brings back efficiency and good communication in hospitals.  In addition, no one on this team has truly worked on a hardware project before, as we are all Software Engineers, so using the Raspberry Pi was a learning experience to say the least.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Med Hub is a Smart Medical Cabinet with a built in software based lock system.  It starts with the doctor.  As the doctor meets with his patients he can view how a patient's therapy and care is going based on his tracking of how the patient is reacting to the treatment using our Android Application.  This first application allows doctors to update prescriptions for each patient as well as view the patient's medication schedule.  The mobile Android Application comes fully equipped with a built in medical database of various medications for various uses for the doctors to reference if needed and so they can better answer patient questions.</p>\n<p>The next step is the pharmacist.  Once the doctor inputs patient data and medicine dosages, that data will be sent to Firebase where we are storing our data and then sent back down to the Web Application built with Bootstrap and JavaScript.  The pharmacist can view what the patient needs and when they need them based on the doctors requests, as well as see updates made by the doctor on the same day rather than get the information lost in a paper trail or chain of voices.  The pharmacist will have to input the patient's name, medicine name, dosage, and time the medication was given out.  If the patient had already received medications that day, then the medicine cabinet will remain locked and will output an error for the pharmacist.  If not, then the medicine cabinet will unlock, leveraging the Raspberry Pi technology and a servo.  In addition, as a visual signal, we leverage iLumi, so that when the cabinet is locked the light will display red and when the cabinet is unlocked, the light will display green.</p>\n<p>With this system, we leverage smart lighting, hardware, mobile applications, and a web applications all making up a single suite of complete software for doctors in hospitals all across the world. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Med Hub was built on various platforms as a software and hardware suite of tools for hospitals.  The Smart Medicine Cabinet lock was built using a Raspberry Pi and a servo for proof of concept.  The mobile application used by the doctor was built using Android Studio for the Android Platform.  The web application was built using Bootstrap, javascript, HTML5, and CSS3, in addition to Firebase to store all patient data with a python based back end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we ran into was with the hardware.  A lot of the hardware was incompatible with each other and put us behind on our project significantly.  With little experience in hardware, the debugging process took more than usual, but the learning experience was tremendous.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Med Hub</h2>\n<p>Since we created a Smart Lock that in this case is only being used with a software suite for medical records and prescriptions, the hardware aspect of our project can be implemented in the financial industry as well as healthcare to protect other forms of records and personal information.  Our next steps with Med Hub are the expand the scope of this project to provide more use cases in different fields and offices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pikachu</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ilumi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">m2x</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Jovl/HackDFW-2016.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Jovl/HackDFW-2016.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on hardware.Used python scripts on Raspberry Pi  to interface with frontend and command smart lock.
