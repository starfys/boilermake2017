Vadim had prior experience working with beacons technology, Nick is already a hackathon war-hero and veteran, Marius is the laser-focused web-dev guy and myself, well, I'm soaking all that we're doing. Be it through business modelling, joining dev talks, searching for resources or APIs or writing our story. \nAs it unravels.</p>\n<p>waveRoll is a solution to one big pain point from UK's rails industry: counting in real-time the people from each carriage during a journey. Based on this, it can provide business insights for the train operators and it can also tell passengers where there is a high probability that they can get a seat. Before they board.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We actually started having in mind the two elements, the silverrail API capabilities and the iBeacons techology. After quickly sketching up the requirements for a webAPI, talking about microservices, scalability, we thought more in depth about how we might get this in front of company executives and travellers alike.</p>\n<p>Getting into the core of waveRoll, there are a few considerations to be made. First, the analytics system is built around the Apache Kafka high-throughput messaging system, which is designed to efficiently aggregate massive amounts of data; its distributed nature allows capacity to be added simply by allocating nodes. \nFor data at rest, we are using ElasticSearch as our storage engine, which is similarly distributed and resilient. In a massive real-world deployment, we would likely abandon this prototype in favour of a higher performance database such as PostGreSQL</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Who doesn't love random technical incongruences on a Saturday evening during a 60h+ hackathon?\nThe actual JSON that we were receiving from the silverrail API, our beloved sponsor, was in the wrong format. The coordinates were almost unusable, save for a brilliant algorithm furiously typed by Nick, chief-in-hackathon. </p>\n<p>Now, I'm not saying that this was our best accomplishment. The actual greatness was for all 120 of us to be here, building and iterating over ideas. Beginners and artisans alike, contributing towards a palpable progress within an entire industry. In less than 3 days.</p>\n<h2>What awaits team waveRoll</h2>\n<p>As of now, we're still inching away in developing our beloved creation, making waveRoll robust and focused on solving a single paint point. \nIt's tomorrow when we'll demo it and all the cards will fall into place. For me, it <strong>already</strong> is a crazy learning experience which I will never forget. My only hope is that someday, I will be able to pass over what I've learned now to someone who, like me today, was given a chance to see product development at its best.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kibana</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/elasticsearch\">elasticsearch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">logstash</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ibeacons</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/silverrail-technologies\">silverrail-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">zookeeper</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kafka</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["RailAssist", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The current system does not elegantly handle changes.

They practically have the same conditions. Well, it's because they are in good company with friends and other people who celebrate the same thing. Why cant we have this kind of environment for trains? We want to start pioneering that shift of mindset through our app ChatPoint.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ChatPoint is an application that encourages customers to socialize with others on a train by providing them a platform to chat with other people they could possibly get along with.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using JavaScript at the client side to display data and node.js on the server side to manage distribution of messages.</p>\n<h2>Advantage to the customer</h2>\n<p>Most customers described their train rides as \"long\", \"dull\", and \"boring\".</p>\n<p>And contrary to popular belief, they do talk to other people on the train. But only if the coversation was started by the other person.</p>\n<p>We found it interesting that only 2 out of the 12 people we physically approached declined a chat with us for the survey.</p>\n<p>Most of them are open to chatting especially when they are interested on the topic. </p>\n<p>Chat point would be a great tool for them to pass their time on the train.</p>\n<h2>Advantage to TOC's</h2>\n<h3>User data</h3>\n<p>Since we have a huge collection of customer data, train companies can now adjust certain strategies accordingly. For example some months could be lean seasons and some unknown tourist destinations could only have a few passengers.</p>\n<p>Through the app's backend analytics, you could see patterns of certain type of people who use the trains that you couldn't have guessed normally. So you could adjust the marketing accordingly.</p>\n<p>You could also see patterns of people's behaviour and their sentiments so you could also adjust operations accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Additional Revenue</h3>\n<p>We would have certain chat topics that are sponsored by brands and people would get certain perks if they participate in the discussion such as a discount on the ticket or in shops. So it's kind of an ad but not really because based on their likes, people would want to participate in the discussion.</p>\n<p>Based on our survey, the 70% of yes' was raised to 93% when the concept of discounts was introduced.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on the backend, getting the chat clients communicating with one another through the server.", "", ""]], ["Train of Thought", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/389/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/403/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/385/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/386/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/387/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/388/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/390/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Train of Thought \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/325/407/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We're making the ticket purchasing experience quicker, more intuitive, and more accessible.

As a voiced based application, we focussed on an ultra-high accuracy of speech-to-text transcription using Google's new web speech API. The accuracy is above 90% for most accents and use cases, and we achieved 100% accuracy for most tests and common queries. IBM's Natural Language classifier service, a part of the Bluemix basket of Watson service, then run the transcribed speech through a classifier that we trained to recognize common customer queries at kiosks such as route finding, ticket purchasing and ticket printing based on a pre-booked purchase and reference number. The confidence index for most results returns by the classifier is over 98% due to the extraordinarily well trained, machine learning service that we built and integrated.  Once queries are classified, the Dialog AI service from Watson is used to provide a fast and accessible interaction with the customer to buy tickets, see route information or print pre-booked tickets. For ticket purchasing and routing, the SilverRail API is called to get the up to date routes between two locations which are extracted from the transcribed text.</p>\n<p>A seamless, fast and accessible user experience.

Train service disruptions occur for many reasons, including train malfunction, accidents, congestion and human error. When disruptions occur, the resulting delays propagate to other trains operating on the same line. This problem is one of the biggest in the rail industry today. A common solution is to re-route trains and reshuffle staff rotas to minimise the effect of a disruption. This is currently done manually, on an ad-hoc basis by dedicated teams. RICCS uses a mathematical constraints model that takes into account routes, trains and staff in order to optimise the schedule given a service disruption scenario as input. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xpress</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Built the web application and required plumbing components - parsing model output into a timeline of train and staff positions.

The perfect length of time to absorb new information is 50 minutes.  Our application makes use of this through bringing teachers and learners together.</p>\n<p>Users connect through their social network login. They then state if they would like to learn or teach and what their interests are. After this they enter what time they will travel between which locations. The app then matches the learner with possible teachers and shows what they teach.</p>\n<p>The learner can message a teacher to see if they would like to attend a lesson of theirs. If so the learner books the teacher and pays it's lecture fee. The learner and teacher then get seats assigned in the train and they meet up and exchange knowledge!</p>\n<h2>Final Product</h2>\n<p>Due to the project being build in a Hackathon we have hacked together a prototype to show the workings of the application. Because the most important thing was the back-end the front-end has been designed to match the resolution of the demo machine (half the screen of a 1920x1080 monitor). The eventual application would be focussed on the mobile platform, thus the resolution choice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bvanderdrift/training\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bvanderdrift/training\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the backend and implemented the front-end design using Meteor.js and Ionic.", "Design & Concept", "", ""]], ["ugo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ugo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/326/688/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>ugo concept illustration</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ugo \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/326/623/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Just ask ugo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ugo \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/326/622/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Why ugo?</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ugo \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/326/618/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Final MVP from Hackthon</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ugo \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/326/619/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Screen Saver of ugo on a specific platform</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ugo \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/326/621/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>After scanning your ticket, you can choose how to continue your journey</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>ugo</h2>\n<p>ugo is a digital information kiosk that is designed to be placed in train stations in order to inform travellers about disruptions &amp; delays as well as provide them with personalised information about their own journey at the right time in the right place.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A first interface paper prototype was drafted in order to be validated by users.</li>\n<li>We asked travellers in Newcastle train station to use the paper prototype and give us feedback in regards to the current features.</li>\n<li>A new hi-fi interface was designed based on their needs and requests.</li>\n<li>A tablet and mobile phone are mounted in a box.</li>\n<li>An app on the phone uses the camera to scan a ticket.</li>\n<li>It then makes a request to a web server sending the ticket data.</li>\n<li>The tablet has a browser open connected to the same web sever.</li>\n<li>When the app has scanned, the web server hits the rail APIs for info.</li>\n<li>WebSockets are used to automatically update the info on the tablet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading the ticket - we did not have magnetic scanner and could not decipher the 2D barcode</li>\n<li>Lack of hardware in the actual Hackthon. Thanks to Nick from Wave Roll, we had a tablet which can be used as a mock-up LCD screen </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Most travellers feel safer knowing the reasons for their delays.</li>\n<li>Many travellers prefer interacting with a digital artefact than asking the information desk .</li>\n<li>Information announcements are many times ignored or very hard to hear due to the noise in the station. </li>\n<li>Travellers loved the idea of having personalised information about their journey available in the context of the station, by scanning their ticket.</li>\n<li>Having a personalised map to navigate large and unfamiliar train stations is a feature well received by the public.</li>\n<li>It would be better to shoot a video than a live demo. Because of the limitations described above, at current stage, a live demo is quite risky.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for ugo</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ugo is getting a new box and will be polished for the next pitch event in December.</li>\n<li>A second round of user validation with the new prototype and a demo video will be filmed.</li>\n<li>We hope to launch a pilot in one of UK's major rail stations to test ugo's effectiveness and we'll gather data about the pilot study that will later be presented to potential business partners.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webapi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/asp-net\">asp.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">signalr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mvc</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["User Interaction, Customer Validation, Business Plan, Prototype Polishing", "Ticket scan implementation, front-end implementation and general development", "User research, Interaction Design, UX, UI, User Evaluation, Customer Validation.
