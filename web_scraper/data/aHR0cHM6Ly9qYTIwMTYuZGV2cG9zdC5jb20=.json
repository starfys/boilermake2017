there are many people who cannot tell what they really think in Japan.\nTo approach this, if you use PEPPER as a spokesman, you can tell what you want to say nicely.</p>\n<h2>For example</h2>\n<h3>In company</h3>\n<p>\u30fbIn a meeting, when you want to say to your boss \"Let's end this conference\".\n\u30fbIn a meeting, when you are asked approval, you cannot say \"NO!\" clealy.\n\u30fbto a person who you lend money, you want to say \"I have you return money\"</p>\n<h3>In house</h3>\n<p>\u30fbTo your wife, you want to say \"You're getting plump\".\n\u30fbIn torommorow after a quarrel, you want to say \"I'm sorry\" when you cannot say because you're shy.\n\u30fbTo your wife, you want to say \"Thank you\" in casual days.</p>\n<h2>System</h2>\n<p>We present our system in detail.\nPEPPER have 2 function mainly.\nFirst, you have PEPPER say what you want by sending a message to PEPPER on Slack.\nSecond, you can control pepper to your target using controller on web

We want to give people the ability to not only see inside their home but also have the ability to control an avatar to complete tasks that was previously impossible unless they are physically there.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>With VR goggles you have the ability to have a full-body take-over of Pepper and control its movements, arms, and vision. With this avatar, you can complete tasks at home using Pepper from anywhere in the world. From doing housework, to checking the stove, and even first emergency response, Pepper will be an extension of you while you are not present.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Techs we used:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pepper</li>\n<li>Leap Motion</li>\n<li>Android</li>\n<li>Oculus</li>\n<li>Unity</li>\n<li>Salt</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>So Pepper's api allows for a very limited amount of control over the robot. You can make and open a fist, rotate the palm/write area, and can rotate the elbow and shoulders on 2 axis. The two biggest problems were the shoulder and elbow. How were we going to turn 3 axis rotation into 2 axis rotation. Also, since the Leap motion does not track the upper arm, how were we going to realistically rotate a shoulder joint. </p>\n<p>Due to the fact that FabCafe did not bring any Myo armbands (even though they said they were bring one/some), we had to improvise and the only other devices that we had access to that had accelerometers were phones. We managed to acquire 2 android phones at 1 am on Sunday and wrote a simple android app that just sends the acceleration data of the phone to a simple web-server on the computer running Unity (the socket server computer). From there every time a new set of values is received it was written to file on the machine. Two files were written, one for each phone. From there, the Unity code would read from the files every frame of the game/whatever this was, and so some fancy black magic math that translated that into the rotational values we sent to the pepper. </p>\n<p>The next part was the elbow, and it was a bit of a pain as well. The way the pepper rotated its elbow as inwards (like in the video (like my movements), and along the forward direction of my arm. The 2nd rotation mentioned is also how the wrist rotates, meaning we had to disable the 2nd rotation for the elbow. So all we did was whenever we sent new data to the pepper as to how to rotate the elbow, we just sent it the same rotational value for that part. We got that data by just taking the hand.Arm.Direction.x of the hand and sending that to the pepper.</p>\n<p>For the wrist, it was pretty simple. We just send the hand.PalmNormal.z to the pepper, and it worked just fine. The same was for closing and opening a fist.

The robot may not be talking about the information in front of their users, but telling the user after they go home. For example, \u201cYour friend birthday will come soon!\u201d \u201cHer robot told me that she looks tired recently, how about sending text to her?\u201d... such kind of information will be a kind reminder for user or helpful information for communication between friends.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Built with Choreographe(Pepper SDK), Python programming, and fitbit API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Connection between multiple Peppers.

During the flight, it's also quite awkward that only time I talk to the guy sitting next to me is \"Excuse me, can I get out to restroom.\" </p>\n<p>Lots of people flying business class are willing to talk to each other to make friends or expand their network. But without knowing each other it's difficult to start the conversation. So what can we do to change the flying experience from \"fly lonely\" to \"fly socially\"? </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a service for passengers to get connected with each other and help them to start conversations easily. </p>\n<p>Passengers can choose to get listed on JAL business class fly socially circle during online check-in, by connecting to their FB or LinkedIn, or manually input information. Even without online check-in, passengers can choose to fly socially on ticking machine. </p>\n<p>Passengers can choose to print out a label or sticker with \"JAL Fly Socially\" sign and flight number, seat number and flying purpose. They can put this on their carry-in bag or shirt. With this sign, people can easily know who is open for conversations, in lounge and other waiting areas.</p>\n<p>The \"JAL Fly Socially\" circle list can be securely browsed on web page. If people don't prefer to expose their information on the list, they can also choose to only print out sticker. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Ruby on Rails, PHP and a wireless sticker printer. </p>\n<p>Boxes and LEGO blocks for the ticketing machine stand.</p>\n<p>Pepper!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Connection from site deployed on internet to a service run on local PC, had to open WIFI router port</li>\n<li>Make Pepper work... also it's kinda slow in displaying web pages</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A good team we made, small but efficient</li>\n<li>A small and executable plan</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Team building is important </li>\n<li>Communication is VERY important between team members</li>\n<li>Have to sleep well</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Fly Socially</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Get everyone to fly socially!</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://flysocially-jefftsui.c9users.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://flysocially-jefftsui.c9users.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>flysocially-jefftsui.c9users.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JeffTsui/JAL_Biz_SN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JeffTsui/JAL_Biz_SN\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Pikap", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pikap \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/383/911/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pikap \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/383/937/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pikap \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/383/892/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pikap \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/383/938/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pikap \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/383/896/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>\"Pikap\"</h1>\n<p>Team Ants 2016/05/07\nJunction Asia 2016\n\u200b</p>\n<h1>Product description</h1>\n<p>Pikap is an airport pick-up helper service using iBeacon.</p>\n<p>Slide is here <a href=\"https://goo.gl/f5eItt\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://goo.gl/f5eItt</a>\n\u200b</p>\n<h2>Challenging Problem</h2>\n<p>There are more than 8 million people flying over the world in a single day. Several thousands of passengers for business trips, travellers going alone sometimes needs for pickups. </p>\n<p>In such case, receptions would usually write down the name of visitor on some big paper or whiteboard. But wait, it is 21st century! The IoT devices, smartphones are everywhere but we are still using some paperboard to meet each other.\n\u200b</p>\n<h2>Our solution</h2>\n<p>Pikap solves the airport pickup problem using iBeacon technology. When the passenger checks in at his departure, airline company provides them a Pikap. Several iBeacon sensors are placed on special checkpoints at airport. Upon his arrival, receptionist would know where the passenger is and meet up with him.</p>\n<p>With iBeacon, pick-ups could be done smartly and there is no need to worry about internet connection.\n\u200b</p>\n<h2>Our vision</h2>\n<p>By air companies using our Pikap, the passenger can easily meetup with other people at the airport.</p>\n<p>The bigdata from the service, about passengers' behaviour inside the airport, could improve the airport process such as baggage carousel.</p>\n<p>Not only the receptionist but the passenger's family or friends can also know that he or she safely arrived at the destination.\n\u200b</p>\n<h2>Techs</h2>\n<p>Devices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iBeacon</li>\n<li>Intel Edisons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Python, jQuery, Node.js</li>\n<li>ClearDB, MySQL</li>\n<li>IBM Bluemix server (Web service(Flask), Twillio)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We used iBeacon device for passenger and Intel Edison for iBeacon sensors. By using iBeacon, passenger do not need any internet connection or take any action. Intel Edison is compact computing device for detecting iBeacons and send data to server.</p>\n<p>Our backend is deployed on IBM Bluemix. Python Flask web-app is deployed on Bluemix PaaS.

We did some market research to find out which were the biggest pain points in air travel from the consumer perspective, and it turns out that passengers mostly complain about comfort, being bothered by other passengers (noise) and the in-flight entertainment quality.\nWe decided to take JAL to the next level of technology and develop an <strong>immersive VR entertainment and wellness system</strong> to address those issues. The result of those efforts is the <strong>Sensorama3D</strong> platform</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sensorama3D is an in-flight multimedia entertainment and communication platform. It combines a VR headset with gesture commands to create an immersive environment with the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>360\u00b0 view of the plane's surroundings and information about the flight</li>\n<li>private HD VR movie theatre</li>\n<li>video games in VR</li>\n<li>wellness and relaxation channel to help dealing with claustrophobia and jet lag</li>\n<li>in-flight notification and communication system</li>\n<li>personal device connectivity (smartphone, PC)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We take reference to the currently popular in-flight entertainment system and try to improve upon it with Oculus and RealSense. Based on the health and well-being needs air passengers, we designed methods to reduce or even remove the symptoms. We also provide information that is the most helpful and convenient for the passengers in-flight as well as after landing. Passengers will be provided with the best mental stage and the energy they need to take any upcoming challenge.</p>\n<h2>How we built</h2>\n<p>With Unity and the RealSense SDK Unity toolkit, we achieve a simple gesture navigable GUI and a few interacting elements that best suit an in-flight environment. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We're still figuring out how to make RealSense work reliably.\nWe also had some heated discussions about the business side and what would be the best implementation strategy</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're the first ones combining VR with sensors to create such an experience. VR is coming to air travel one way or another, and we think our proposal can provide the best user experience.\n<strong>The first airline to offer VR entertainment can use this competitive advantage to increase sales</strong> and use the momentum to position itself as the best hi-tech airline.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a little bit about in-flight consumer experience and the airline industry.\nWe also learned how to incorporate sensor technology like RealSense into a Unity application.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sensorama3D</h2>\n<p>We'd like to do a \"pilot project\" (pun indended) with Sensorama3D to start testing and improving our service. It could then be implemented as a standard offer in business class and above. As VR technology becomes more accessible in the coming years, Sensorama3D could be rolled out to Premium Economy or even Economy class.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/realsense\">realsense</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ricoh\">ricoh</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Experienced CTO at number of successful international Startups, Mentor and Technologist.

Not only it gave us to be relax at home, but also experience to play a role among the family through growing vegetables, feeding fish and recording observation report. It leads to feel to keep natural ecosystem together. It's a good education and communication.\nAs a communication tool, we built an app which was family communication platform using mesh by uploading photo when feeding fish, observation report and recording voices. \nAs a education tool, we created a real-time-update monitor which showed circulation of substances in the aquaponics which is not visible.

Background noise is eliminated completely as the music is generated by the app. By using this, starting a band and practice becomes ultimately smooth.\n2) Treble Play- Synthetic models that simulate a real instrument in terms of look and feel are used for the software to detect motion and play notes. These models are rollable/foldable and have no electronic parts Eg) A Rollable Piano . As the model will be cheap and portable, People overcome the hesitation of buying an instrument/\n3) Treble Learn - A Game+tutorial that walks a user through progressive lessons.

This encouraging method results in users being more motivated to play an instrument.</p>\n<h2>How we built it.</h2>\n<p>The intel Real Sense Camera is capable of identifying 3D objects and their movements.

We wanted to motivate people to meet with Pepper.  Also, we wanted to introduce some personality to Pepper.  We wanted to make Pepper more interesting.  We want to make more people motivated to see Pepper in shops, tourist sites and so on.  This would be not only for tourists but also   </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Every player has a side, light or dark.  The player wants to convert all Peppers in this world to be on their side.  They can use a smartphone app that shows a map of nearby Peppers so they can know which Pepper to \"attack\".  Pepper will challenge the player and Pepper's \"heart force\" will increase or decrease based on the results of the fight.  If the \"heart force\" reaches a certain threshold, Pepper will change to the light side or dark side.  </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a backend with ruby on rails.  We used Choregraphe to program Pepper to show a web page that is the game.  The game was written using the Phaser game engine in javascript.  The smartphone app implemented web technologies such as three.js.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The tactile sensors are not sensitive enough and the response speed is slow.  But we think this can be improved in the next version of Pepper.  We also had time constraints so we were not able to complete the mobile application part and also the look and polish.  We have to work on integrating everything also.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We think this is a good idea that would be very popular.  It would benefit Softbank's business.  We are proud to have a working prototype.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Choregraphe to program Pepper and also how to integrate various languages.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pepper Wars</h2>\n<p>We want to release a working app and a smoother version of the game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

The door automatically unlocks to ensure an escape route in case the door frame gets destroyed. When the ceiling collapses, it sends a report to alert that people are trapped inside.

We want to be able to bridge the gap between the tedious manual efforts that make us not want to have fun in life and bring it back! </p>\n<p>It is worth noting that we have so far is a \"proof of concept.\"</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Having understood that Video DJing is becoming more popular, we wanted to bring this to the ever-scalable world of Virtual Reality.</p>\n<p>Many of us hear good music we like on the radio, and want to have the same \"mad\" skills these DJs have in order to mix our own music as well. However, DJing has always been a rather tedious manually controlled industry, where there are controllers for the sound equalizing, Vinyl and CD turntables for the scratching sounds and playing the music, and sometimes extra digital equipment to help store more music, or to act as a virtual alternative for the above.</p>\n<p>On the converse, the younger generation really likes playing games as well. Any new game developed on code for mobile OS will have a decent chance at becoming a popular game amongst any group of friends. This can be proven by the way that many Android emulators are now made to 'play' the game that is the mobile application, and how so many have tools directly to help game players record their progress, etc.</p>\n<p>With Virtual Reality games taking the market by storm, it's poised to be the next Internet (still popular after 20 years), as it was similarly developed for use in Military (simulation) and is now being used to adapt a public taste. Plus, more and more people are thinking it's cool that we can create an experience of our own making.</p>\n<p>To this end, it made sense to us that we could create a music player game of sorts, where by loading the desired music to be listened to, one could make artistic designs from fractals or even see a side view of a guy dancing to the speed and flavor of the music.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>The \"Club @ Home\" is your all-in-one solution for having fun. Why? For DJs, this gives you extra practice with real-time audio-video and you can even get real-time feedback. All while giving a real-audience the time of their lives, and making smarter use of your practice time. [Disclaimer: Realistically speaking, until we can get enough partners, there will be many automated DJs as well, similar to the type that some radio stations use.]</p>\n<p>For the listeners at home, this gives you the perfect opportunity to pick up your VR devices (for example, the ones that came with your new Samsung S7 phone) and rock out to beats. And like many other music services you already know, you can rate whether you like what you are hearing. This will give the DJ you are listening to a better idea of what songs they should mix. If the DJ has enabled it, you can even message them and talk about songs with them.</p>\n<p>All things said, the big story of this product is the Visual Reality aspect.</p>\n<p>For DJs, this is the future of DJing, where you might interact with your audience remotely. You can view a good show of both art and (with a license) also make your own virtual avatars to predict how your club would dance, interact (with each other), and react (to you). We aim for this to be a totally virtual, but also completely immersive solution.</p>\n<p>For the listeners, this allows for not only a listening experience that some services already provide, but also adds on a visual image of the club as well, allowing you to imagine yourself as a part of the club. In the free versions, it's a show of art and pre-made video reactions to the music that you will view. However, if you enter a pay-per-view server show of a live DJ who chose to make this own video reactions, or if you make your own as an enthusiast with the licensed DJ version, then you can see a realistic club rave scene!</p>\n<p>\nIt's a DJ-\"OS\" emulator where it is running a \"club music player @ home\" application.</p>\n<p>The \"OS\" is provided by underlying API code through Unity and mostly in C++ linking the movie types designed with the waveforms of the uploaded and matched music.</p>\n<p>The application, of a music player similar to most home theatre systems is of a regular nature for such a program; however, through Unity and the Oculus SDK, we've made a version that can be ran in Virtual Reality platforms instead. This makes it similar to most first-person games, which allows for an immersive experience, where it is more convincing that you are truly a DJ of the arts and dance.</p>\n<p>In today's Software as a Service environment, we find it important that there be automation to provide what we may want, and as DJs, we can say that it might make the practice sessions so many of us do at home much more enjoyable (with perfected graphics and the like).</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Code-wise, the development is supported by Unity's own language structure, with all of the animations and music recognition engines being powered by C++ code.</p>\n<p>The backend API is provided by a Unity IDE and the Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.</p>\n<p>The design is a hybrid of assets found on Unity and that of creation by C++ code. All movie interactions are also C++.</p>\n<p>Finally, it is being relayed through to the Oculus VR console by the SDK provided hardwired projecting HDMI cable, but in the future, we hope it might be supported by wireless download to an embedded storage chip on the VR console itself, so one only needs the console (regardless of Internet) to play this game.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We learned that Oculus has SDKs for both their DK2 (and DK1) developer's SDK kits, and their Rift products, separately. This took some time to adjust to. Consequently, we kept having failed installations.</p>\n<p>This event also tested our sense of utility and alternative solutions. Our WiFi connection at the initial Hackathon was often weak, which for having to download and move files between computers, was poisonous. However, we kept moving around, tracing the source of problems, and we all learned more about how the assigning switch end of the cables work.</p>\n<p>Finally, in making the music and movie, we had to test our understanding of standards and ear. By standards, for the music, this would mean the types of music that we can play, without obviously overloading the program (e.g. hard rock is a true difficulty, as the gain in the waveform creates an annoying white noise). For the movie, it was a matter of understanding the true nature of different file forms and containers, as we had to re-encode an \"Mp4\" file so it was truly in the H.264 - 5.2 encoding schema. Fortunately, there is good software like HandBrake to do </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>In understanding that the music for the demo had to be acceptably not ripped music off the Internet, but at least have creativity and fair use to be used, we used the commercial modification platform for [computer-only] DJs, Virtual DJ Pro7. Not having done a lot of fancy mixing before, we were intrigued by the many possibilities proposed by changing the key or the beat, or even just making one song fit well with another. Many thanks to the DJ of the team, DJ Icewobs.</p>\n<p>We also were able to successfully integrate all the files between both a Windows version of the Unity SDK and a Mac version, showing that our code is quite tolerant to use through a code-content management system for server commitment backups, such as GitHub.</p>\n<p>Finally, we're happy to have had the great designing skills for the movies, and for the creation of the fractals within them. This was very helpful to the creation of the movies we used with the program.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that using the wrong software for a system can really destroy it. During the competition, a misconfigured install of a program led to the corruption of the OS. This was very problematic, but we managed to fix this.</p>\n<p>Also, we learned about the difficulty of actually changing music in a way that it still makes sense. When people usually play music as a DJ, they just play a song. However, we learned that as a fact of commercial pitching, if using a well-known song, we must consider copyright status, and apply to the US Copyright Stature 106 of \"Fair Use\" by making \"considerable modifications\" where the new product is \"measurably different\" than the original.</p>\n<p>FInally, we learned more about some of the newer changes in Unity 5 (vs. what we were more familiar with in previous versions) and made adjustments to our working knowledge by understanding and leveraging the nature of what is \"documentation.\"</p>\n<h2>Economic Versatility of Seed</h2>\n<p>We want to calculate a risk of asking for 50000000 JPY (\u4e94\u5343\u4e07\u5186\uff09in total from interested investors.</p>\n<p>This is because we want to start as a privately invested company with chance of becoming an IPO if the idea becomes big.</p>\n<p>We estimate two major costs:</p>\n<p>An average of 850000 (\u516b\u5341\u4e94\u4e07\u5186) JPY per year salary for 15 employees and\nAn average of 250000 (\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u4e07\u5186\uff09JPY per month cost of running electricity in a small office building and for taking out aobut 15 (10-20) cloud servers.\nAn average of about 12000000 (\u5343\u4e8c\u767e\u4e07\u5186) for 50 more employees yearly salary of 240000 JPY (\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u4e07\u5186)</p>\n<p>We estimate a business model of the following listings of revenue stream in the first year:</p>\n<p>About 90000 yen each, of thirty \"30-second advertisements\", or an asking price of about 3000 yen per each second.\nAbout 5000 yen each for each of at least about 4000 private pay-per-view sessions (sessions attended)\nAbout 25000 yen for each Premium license (making a profit from this software is OK commercial licenses) for DJs and enthusiasts who want to make custom avatars.\nAbout 13000 yen for each for each Pro [fessional] license (able to make your own virtual server to stream your own music, but not your own avatars). You many not make a profit with this license.</p>\n<p>On case-by-case basis, we can also support requests from educational, governmental, and not-for-profit organisations to provide them with a similar version to the Premium license that works for only one event (about a week) up to three such events per organisation per year (one, plus one more up to three for referring the software to someone else).</p>\n<p>The licensing model will be a yearly subscription where the amount you pay will be slightly higher than the listed above prices if you opt to pay on a monthly basis. We have yet to set this amount as we wish help from industry to set such a price. If interested, we could discuss the licensing models we have in mind and discuss the best ways to make this work.</p>\n<p>As a side note, ((850000*15) + (250000*12) + (50*20000*12)) - ((90000*30) + (5000*4000) + (500*25000) + (1000*13000)) is the calculation of Costs - revenue, which gives us a net profit of 20450000 yen (2045\u4e07\u5186\uff09per year.</p>\n<p>This is not considering unknown, hidden, and licensing costs that we may have to incur, so further advice would be needed on this matter if it were to be made into an actual startup.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Club @ Home</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the next thing would be to finish up the backend, so that the code could be made committable into a GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>Following this automation of the backend, further animation work on the frontend movies might be done, in order to open up more options.</p>\n<p>A mobile controller using the Oculus Mobile SDK would certainly be the next step, as more and more people are now using mobile devices to game, including cases where the mobile is only used as the controller (and the image is sent wirelessly and over bluetooth to the headset in such cases).</p>\n<p>Somewhere around here, we would have to start making web and media advertisements to try to advertise our product, and perhaps start offering trial periods in order to grow into the three Vs of bigger scales of data: variety of input data (songs), a large volume of users (from different regions), and a high velocity system where data can be efficiently transported (perhaps forcing us to consider re-writing inefficient portions of code) between say central servers of our product and a desktop or mobile user (either by Internet, or mobile data cell towers, respectively).</p>\n<p>Finally, if the game got large enough, over many platforms, then we might need a scalable big data web services provider in order to both simultaneously collect data usage for pattern recognition and suggestions of the next song.</p>\n<p>Considerations on security might begin at this point as well, including ways to discourage reverse engineering and to handle large amounts of users with more accuracy. We might also have to worry about making sure that if users decide to start personalising and storing their information, that we give them the option of making a username and password, and on our end, securely encrypting their password in a harder to crack form, such as SHA-1024 or even SHA-2048 key.</p>\n<h1>Concluding Thought</h1>\n<p>Realistically, not everyone will want to DJ, but we hope that anyone who's \"felt the beat\" before will consider raving along with our cool product!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">videography</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">music-of-mad-dj-skills</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">potential-of-scalability</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opengl\">opengl</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on making the music and supplied the backend hardware to run the programs.
