Others use mobile apps that involve manual tracking. Some don't track their workout for the simple fact that it's too much of a hassle. We wanted to change this by making workout tracking automatic. People don't realize they need something until they use it, and this is serves true at our live demo.</p>\n<h2><strong>What it does</strong></h2>\n<p>A custom mount holds any phone on top of a bench press bar. Our app then measures reps, sets, and proper form in real-time. Our machine learning algorithm measures and displays your progress post-workout. </p>\n<h2><strong>How We Built it</strong></h2>\n<p>We use the phone's built in accelerometer to track user reps. We then use timing algorithms to differentiate rest time between sets. The gyroscope measures proper form by helping you level the bar. We also did analytics on the data to view once we see that the exercise is completed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges We Ran Into</strong></h2>\n<p>Thinking of the algorithm to accurately define and measure progress proved challenging initially. Coming up with a way to filter out the noise from the accelerometer data to track reps was difficult since it was so sensitive to even the slightest movement. We had numerous problems with 3D printing since we had no experience with it or even know which software to use.</p>\n<h2><strong>Accomplishments</strong></h2>\n<p>We got a 3D printed platform with perfect fit for what we needed. We found work arounds for every technical issue without cutting features, which is a first for us in a hackathon.</p>\n<h2><strong>What We learned</strong></h2>\n<p>We learned new machine learning algorithms. We learned how to use 3D modeling software and which software to not use the hard way. We learned how to use gyroscopes and accelerometers in android. Also, if you bring in gym equipment to a hackathon, it attracts a lot of attention. </p>\n<h2><strong>Whats next</strong></h2>\n<p>We expand the app to include other exercises and build up a more robust website. We also plan on making this app compatible with standard gym machines such as those with a weight stack. We plan to sell the platform to gym owners and keep the app free or freemium for the users.</p>\n<p>Other companies believe that people have to buy wearable devices in order to track their workouts. They want people to buy yet another expensive wearable that requires daily charging, and cannot distinguish between different machines and free-weights.

Admissions teams are usually comprised of just a few people and they need to go through thousands of submissions. The time a reviewer spends with each submission suffers due to this disproportionally. We want to assist students to ensure that their personal statements accurately  portray them and show just exactly they have to show.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Personal Statement Assister (PSA) is a tool where any student can see what vibes are given from their essays. Using IBM's Bluemix we analyzed each essay, returning what personality characteristics are most evident in their writing. This is important since one of the goals of personal statements is to show who the students are as a person. PSA also incorporates IBM's Watson Text-to-Speech functionality. A common occurrence one has when trying to proof read their own works is skipping over minor details. Since we are the creators of our own works, we know what we intended to say and my overlook things when read through again. The text to speech functionality can help pick up on these minor errors since we are more likely to notice them if we come across them verbally than visually. Lastly PSA uses a natural language processing API that is able to summarize the input. This feature is of high importance since this summary is most likely what the college admission team will probably get from reading a student's essay.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We did run into some problems with the summarization API. Chrome prohibits certain HTTP requests if it determines that there may be security flaws. Due to this issue we weren't able to display the information retrieved. We did try retrieving this information through the backend but this posed a similar issue.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Personal Statement Assister</h2>\n<p>Further research is needed to find out how exactly we are going to be posting this information, which may include having to switch to a different API</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://personalstatementassister.mybluemix.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://personalstatementassister.mybluemix.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>personalstatementassister.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["tunemap", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MOrgrkzkyKM?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"tunemap \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/298/904/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"tunemap \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/298/905/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"tunemap \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/298/906/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"tunemap \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/298/907/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>The lyrics of a song are a powerful source of information about the themes and sentiment in the song.\nWe aimed to build a unique profile of each song based on its lyrical content. \nWe first obtained a large dataset of music lyrics (~200000) and performed topic modeling on it. We specifically used an algorithm called <strong>Latent Dirichlet Allocation</strong> (LDA), a modern statistical method that can discover themes in corpora in an unsupervised fashion (meaning no hand labeling is necessary). </p>\n<p>We were able to obtain <em>topic vectors</em> associated with each song, which essentially act as a unique profile. The value in the vector with the highest value is the main genre/theme the song fits into. We decided to use these topic neighbors to construct a music graph. Each song is considered a node in the graph and is connected to several of its closest neighbors. Logically, songs with similar themes are closer to each other, so the graph structure holds a lot of information about song similarity.</p>\n<p>We first built a simple graph visualizer, where a user can start at a random song (or pick their own) and explore the vicinity by expanding the neighborhood of nearby nodes. We built this in the browser using <code>d3.js</code>, a SVG visualization tool for Javascript. We display an interactive snapshot of the music graph, where nodes are colored by genre. Furthermore, we can listen to any of the songs on the music graph in the interface by double-clicking a node.</p>\n<p>This interface led us to discover some really interesting trends in the music graph, most obviously that foreign languages have some very dense clusters, and that there exists an 80s \"black hole\", an extremely dense region of lyrically similar songs from the 80s (that is often hard to leave while traversing). This tool actually worked well as a tool of music discovery, as we found ourselves listening to new genres and even languages of music and enjoying the extremely random element to the discovery.</p>\n<p>We then decided to build a second tool, based on the ideas of random walks on the music graph. Given two songs, we found a random path between the two. This allows us to generate a random playlist where we slowly transition from the first song's genre into the second's. This also acted as a really interesting tool of music discovery, since we could watch the playlist being built in realtime and observe the different genre and theme transitions that were being made. A user can specify the two songs of their choice or pick two at random. After the playlist is generated, it immediately begins playing in the interface.</p>\n<p>This application is a novel instance of visual music discovery. Most music discovery tools just list out copious amounts of songs and albums, or pick a random chain for you with no context. With our tool, you can begin your music discovery in a familiar place and branch out as you feel, exploring particular clusters of music before moving onto others. Associating the connectivity of the music graph with our own tastes has great power, as it really allows us to understand our own auditory taste from a visual perspective.</p>\n<p>We feel that this application is a cool proof-of-concept that should be the future of music discovery. The current state of music discovery is not so great; black-box machine learning algorithms make predictions based on past listens. The random element of our approach, along with the unsupervised aspect of our data, gives the user a lot more power to discover music their own interests at their own pace.</p>\n</div>\n<div

Borders</h1>\n<p>A iOS application that allows citizens in European Countries to host Syrian Refugees as they are fleeing war </p>\n<p>Checkout our website for more information!  <a href=\"http://futurewithoutborders.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://futurewithoutborders.org/</a></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Humanity has faced many challenges throughout history, and even though this is the twenty first century we still face many challenges today. Living in the west shelters us from many of these crisis that occur daily, often without our knowledge. One of these issues that has just begun to get noticed here is the Syrian refuge crisis. With over 16 million people displaced, nearly 1 in every 13 Syrians is a refugee; these refugees are flooding into Europe and other nearby countries in attempt to escape civil war, isis, and now recently Russian drone strikes. </p>\n<h2>Breaking the problem down</h2>\n<p>So we decided to address this incredible problem. How do we help these countries handle such large influxes of immigration. How do provide basic necessities such as shelter, food, and water? And most importantly how do we make sure these people are not forgotten. Governments are doing very little for these refugees, so we came up with a unique solution. We decided to have citizens across Europe sign up to host just 1 refugee family. Alone it\u2019s very difficult to elicit change, however with many people working together we realized that a large problem could be broken down. </p>\n<h2>Our Solution</h2>\n<p>Hosts across Europe use our mobile app to sign up and offer a family a place to stay. Our app links to a parse, backend that discovers the nearest refugees and displays them to the hosts. So this allows hosts to discover refugees, but how do refugees find hosts? The average refugee fleeing from war won\u2019t have a smartphone, so all they need to do is text our number, and we provide them with essential info on where to go, who to contact, and how to get there, all simply through sms. This we accomplished through the Twilio api sitting on IBM Bluemix as our cloud deployment, from there we interfaced with parse to find the best possible match between refugees and hosts. We used the internet of things to make european cities more responsive to influxes, and are launching a global initiative to help the tragedy from escalating any further. We hope you\u2019ll join us in transcending human borders, and make our product a phenomena across the globe!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AkhilNadendla/Humans-Without-Borders\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AkhilNadendla/Humans-Without-Borders\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the concept, design, and UI; I built the front end of the app and also worked on implementing the parse SDK.", "Worked on the front end integration with Facebook along with the front and back end integration of Parse.

However, almost every medium of sharing comes with its own set of challenges and may require a previous point of contact. Platforms of social media and cloud are great at sending information, but require a tedious authentication process and need both parties to consent and share their contact details. This adds unnecessary protocol to an otherwise innocent and streamlined objective.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Paper makes full use of the present - <strong>it cares about the here and now</strong>. You might be attending an event looking to grow your network, sitting in on a lecture looking desperately for a pdf of your textbook, or hanging out with friends and trading those really silly pictures that never found their way out of your phone - Paper is always a swipe away from helping you share your contacts, trade pdfs, and shoot those pictures out of your phone.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>Paper as a service provides a framework to cluster phones based on location. If you are hanging out with your friends on a Friday night, the app will automatically detect and enable you to share your files within the group with a swipe. This skips the extra overhaul of signing up for an authenticated service and adding new contacts. The mobile app sends the information to our back-end NodeJS server which then points the package towards the right destination(s), providing a cloud-based solution for fast, efficient, and local file sharing. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Pen Pal", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pen Pal \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/853/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Why Pen Pal?</h2>\n<p>Most of the problems in today's world is caused by a lack in communication. From relationships to world affairs, a lack of understanding and openness can be extremely detrimental. All people on this planet are much more similar than we may ever realize. With this desire for communication and the acknowledgment of humanity's commonalities, Pen Pal was born as a homage to elementary school days of writing letters to a friend in a much different place than you were.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Pen Pal is a unique social app that uses users' greatest interests to match you to someone with similar interests. However, the person that you are matched with is the one the farthest away in location from you. The app will notify you when someone has been found, and you will be able to chat with a user from, potentially, across the world. All while using a beautifully designed UI made to look both fun and interesting.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Pen Pal was designed in XCode using Swift. Parse was also used to create a user database and for the messaging system.

He wants to care for the environment but never puts in all of his effort because he has so much other stuff keeping him busy in life. Carl wants something that is cheap, easy to install, and can keep track of his water consumption and compare to his community and city as a whole. Carl also wants to keep track with friends to motivate him and better society as a whole.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>An affordable, easy to install solution to keep track of and aid in water conservation. Our solution represents a much cheaper and more efficient finalized product. It hooks onto sources of water and uses a flex sensor and Spark Core Arduino chip to measure water usage and records it to a influxdb database. The data is then used in the iOS app where it is presented to the user in simple and intuitive interface. The user can then use the app to track their progress, compete with friends, and keeps track of the progress as a community.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Spark Core chip turned out to be very unreliable and would drop signals, constantly disconnect from wifi, and we were not be able to directly program onto the device and had to use their cloud to deploy and compile our code. \nThe standard HTTP request library on the Spark Core chip strips request query parameters.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>Having functional deployed app and device that records real time data and reports it back to a database.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Stream</h2>\n<p>Adding full functionality and developing it into an affordable and easy to install device.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/benbenbob1/stream\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/benbenbob1/stream\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["UI/UX, design, and branding", "Built the flow meter and the collection backend.", "iPhone app"]], ["DrinkedIn", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DrinkedIn \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/920/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to combine mixology and cocktails with embedded systems and hardware. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We would play a song, and as various colored LEDs would flash on and off based off high and low audio frequency, a set of homemade perastaltic pumps would released fruit juices into a glass.

We thought it could be a helpful tool not only for students, but also electrical engineers who need to solve basic circuits in order to analyze more complex ones. After looking online, we found that there is no current service online that can solve circuits with the only input being a picture.</p>\n<p><strong>We are eligible for all prizes that don't require the use of a specified API or device.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>The CircuitSolver5000 can accurately solve missing values in DC circuits. Although limited to batteries and resistors, the algorithm can support a high level of complexity in current paths, and can also be used to solve for smaller circuits that are part of a larger machine.</em></p>\n<p>It first takes the user input of a jpeg circuit picture. Instead of traditional symbols for resistors, batteries, and other components, the user must denote parts with color. The resistors and batteries are represented with a red and blue dot, respectively. Additionally, a green dot is drawn on every node, to more efficiently solve for different paths the current can take.   </p>\n<p>The system uses <em>color thresholding and recognition</em> to detect and solve for the pixel locations of the resistors, nodes, and batteries. Then, output serves as the input for the algorithm to calculate combined resistances, and eventually total resistance. </p>\n<p>To algorithmically process the resistors, we needed a way to store in paths information about resistors being in series or in parallel. To do this, we created a new method of representing the different resistance paths the current can take. Automatically generated multidimensional nested arrays grouped together series and parallel circuits in unique ways, following the path of the current. When a new array starts in the storage, the algorithm automatically recognizes this as a switch from series to parallel. Through this method, the numerous branches and parallel circuits could be represented in a matrix that then solved for combined resistances.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The color recognition and detection component that found pixel locations of all circuit components and the resistor combination algorithm that then solved for missing components were <em>built entirely by us</em> in python, without the use of opensource code. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One challenge we faced was translating the circuit picture into the locations of all the resistors, batteries, and nodes. At first, we tried to use letter <em>recognition and circle detection</em> by denoting components as letters inside circles. For example, a resistor would be drawn as an R inside a circle. However, we found that using color to denote different components was more efficient, because no training or testing data was necessary. </p>\n<p>The biggest challenge we faced was translating the locations into concrete information about the circuit, specifically the resistors in parallel and series. To solve this, we used <em>nested arrays</em> and denoted groups of parallel circuits with extra sets of brackets. In the resistance combination, the algorithm would first inversely combine the parallel circuits, then automatically group together all remaining components. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're extremely proud of the algorithm's ability to solve more complicated circuits. At first, we thought that we would only be able to solve the most basic circuits, but our resistance combination algorithm proved to be accurate as we increased the complexity of the pathways. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned so much about the different ways that a computer can turn user input into the needed information. Through our experimenting with binary trees, node maps, and recursive pathways, we learned how to combine these concepts into an algorithm. </p>\n<h2>What's next for CircuitSolver5000</h2>\n<p>We hope to introduce capacitors, inductors, and more batteries into our algorithm. We also want to turn our system into an app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the solving algorithm.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Story telling has historically always been an important means of connecting with other people. We wanted to bring this principle into today's online-driven community with a fun twist. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users can start their own original stories by pitching a first sentence or contribute to other ones by suggesting what you think will happen next. During each round, each user adds to the story, and all the users will vote on which addition is the best. Because of this, the story can go in many interesting ways, and no story will be the same. Additionally, you can browse through finished stories and relive the creative progression sentence by sentence.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Front end was developed with the trandition package of HTML5, CSS, and JS. Additionally, we used Angular.js to enhance the client side experience. In the back end, we used the node.js with express framework to create the foundation of the website. We used socket.io for real time updates during the writing phase of the story and mySQL to store the site's data. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One major issue during development was that we had no dedicated front end developer, so we had to learn and implement front end design on the fly. On the back end side, we also had trouble synchronizing the voting system between server and client sides.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>As with any hackathon, coming together to actually finish a project along its 36 hour duration was an achievement that we are proud of accomplishing. Furthermore, as most of us are still only novice web developers, we are proud that we were able to integrate so many technologies together to create a fun and exciting app that I'm sure many will enjoy in the future.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Collectively as a team, we gained valuable experience with producing a large scale project with efficient use of git version control. In addition, many of us learned to use new technologies such as socket.io and managed to apply it in such a short span of time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for FiN.</h2>\n<p>There are several features that we intended to implement that we didn't end up getting time to do. For example, the front end UI is lacking in interesting or exciting page elements. We also wanted to implement a rating system for the stories so that more popular stories can be shown first on the reading page. User profiles was also another feature that we could have used to give notoriety or credibility to users so that they may have extended privileges or access to higher tiered stories, but unfortunately this idea never came to fruition. Lastly, we wanted to classify stories by different genres. Hopefully we will have time to finish the incomplete parts of our app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yuz217/SDHacks2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yuz217/SDHacks2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Wishlisty", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Both of my older brothers have had years of experience in the Computer Science and Design industries, and with those years of experience come acquired tastes.

Over the last summer we all shared an amazing new program here called Academy which was made for specifically new transfer students to get an edge and complete some required classes before the start of the regular year. We took three computer science classes over five weeks and it was very difficult, but we all did very well and overcame the challenge. During this time we were also introduced to this fun card game called Set. There's a lot of really cool math involved in the game that gets taken for granted at first glance as 'intuition' or some other vague feeling. Because of our love of Set and our interest in the actual math behind it, we decided to derive an algorithm that would solve a table of cards as efficiently as we possibly can. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Given a properly sorted deck and a list of the cards on the table, it solves the table in O(n^2) time instead of the O(n^3) that would be in the standard implementation. The valid sets are then displayed to the user via a graphical interface. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We originally started working with javascript as an excuse to practice it a bit, but as the algorithm began to increase in complexity I ported it to Java, which is now our final submission. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had to challenge the way we saw what a card really was. After reevaluating the ways a card is represented we were actually able to model the act of finding a set to be very similar to the 3SUM problem, that is, does a set of numbers contain three values that sum to 0. This thought process almost pigeon-holed us into trying to adapt an algorithm that solved the 3SUM problem. If we had left it at that, it would have worked 'most' of the time and would be less elegant than what we actually achieved. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>After deliberating for awhile about how we can use our sorted deck and our new representations of cards, we figured out that we could calculate the exact card needed for a pair to become a Set and then use that information as an index into the sorted deck to find out if that card was on the table or not.

allows streamlined interaction between teachers and their students. \nTeachers can create polling questions that students can answer to stimulate discussion across classrooms.\nTeachers can also generate visual graphs to get classroom trends to improve their own teaching techniques.\nQuickQuack is primarly built off nodejs with the help of basic markup languages.</p>\n<h2>How to run</h2>\n<p>To run, use npm start or nodemon.\nThe program will generate a localhost server from port 3000.\nThis is a proof of concept, waiting to eventually be hosted on a domain.\nStudents can create accounts and select which classes they belong to.\nTeachers can create accounts to list their classes and their appropriate students.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built

Upon realizing that by 2016 over 70% of cars will be connected to mobile devices, we decided to utilize the Android Bluetooth API.  </p>\n<p>One of the inconveniences of driving is the familiar dance of circling a block to find a parking spot.  To streamline this process, we created an app to generate parking data and display this data to the user.  Specifically, we wanted to allow the user to view recently vacated parking spots in their local area.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application utilizes the Bluetooth connection between the user\u2019s mobile device and their car to generate parking data.  When the user connects via Bluetooth to their car, we generate data to show that a nearby parking spot has been vacated. Users can request for this data at the area they are viewing on the map.  This service is performed in the background so that users can easily benefit from the app just by turning on their cars.</p>\n<p>Users searching for a parking spot can view a map with markers indicating recently vacated parking spots. The marker\u2019s opacity changes in parallel to how old the marker is. Users can also find where they have parked their car if users have forgotten. Furthermore, the user can click a specific marker to find out how recently the spot was vacated.  The user can then click a button to directly launch Google Maps to find directions to the parking spot.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built our application using Android Studio, the Google Maps API, and Android Bluetooth API.  We also utilized a LAMP server hosted on Amazon Web Services. </p>\n<p>In addition, we utilized Flattyshadow.com, Paintbrush, and Android Asset Studio for icon creation. Pencil, Sketch, OmniGraffle were used for mockup creation.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We were going to host the server on a local host, but there were connectivity issue. As a result we had to host it on a web server.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We worked very well as a team. We were determined and glad we stuck together throughout this entire Hackathon. We are also proud of our applications simplistic UI and consistent functionality.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Many of the members of our team are new to Android, we are grateful for the opportunity to learn.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CarCache</h2>\n<p>Implement the functionality for the users to have an account and have more than one car be associated with each account.</p>\n<p>We hope to create an IOS version in order to generate more parking data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/shertle/CarCache\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/shertle/CarCache\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed and implemented the Android client and hooked up the Bluetooth and Google APIs.", "I make the icon and mockup", "", ""]], ["Tayto", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Login Information</h2>\n<p>Username: test\nPassword: hello world</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Reddit, YouTube, Amazon, Vine</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A social network for users to search or make reviews about products.

In a sleek, seamless, and intuitive design, Vendop\u00e9 allows the user to search through local listings from users like him or herself. Each listing is intended to efficiently communicate the skills, pricing, and ratings of each user. Once the user finds a person he or she would like to hire for a task, take for example a pedicure, the person need only tap contact on our app and arrange the job and meeting with the other user. Satisfied with the experience? Give the person a 5-star rating. Not so much? Maybe a 3 this time. At the same time, if you happen to be one of those 5-star manicurists, but you don't feel like going through the hassle of starting up an entire business for something you enjoy doing on the side, then hop on Vendop\u00e9 and get (sort of) working! </p>\n<p>With the average Joe, everyday user kept in mind during the entirety of the development process for this app, we certainly believe our app would be a welcome change in the world of employment and labor. Got some spare time in the afternoon and give pretty decent haircuts? Want to find commissions for your own amateur design studio? Need to find someone to help you move into your new apartment after asking your friends and witnessing their sudden, mysterious disappearance? Forget the hassle and the hustle of getting other parties involved. Be your own agent.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our group was largely inspired by the idea of crowdsourcing an app. The idea that tons of people could come together to form such a crucial part of the app, thereby helping us developers and themselves in using said app, really appealed to us. We ran through a few initial pitches and began to notice common trends in all of our suggestions. We wanted an app that any user could feel comfortable immediately jumping into. With that in mind, we focused on topics that could be relatable to a common user base of people with both an abundance of time on their hands and a degree of unique skills/talents!</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built Vendop\u00e9 on Swift with Xcode. We used multiple frameworks (such as Eureka, MMDrawer, Mapkit, etc.) to try and implement a well-designed, responsive application. We also used Parse as the database for our backend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge this time around was definitely time management. With so many features in mind and only two days to build it from scratch, while dealing with a learning curve for some of us, we certainly had to axe a few other ideas we thought would've been great to have in there that didn't make it to demo day. Other challenges we ended up facing were eventually solved through proper Googling technique, honed from years of training and practice.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Personally, I'm very proud of the idea and product my team arrived at. I think it's a friendly user app with an interesting topic that only has all the more room to keep going up, becoming friendlier and more interesting every step of the way. I'm also very proud of the dedication my group took to put up such an effort. After spending so long plugging away at ideas and figuring out storyboards, we spent night and day churning out</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>I learned plenty of Swift during this adventure. I've also learned that keeping up with the latest and greatest of libraries and frameworks certainly helps when it comes to churning out products and learning new technologies.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Vendop\u00e9</h2>\n<p>While nothing's been agreed on yet, I'd love to keep working on it. I firmly believe that Vendop\u00e9 is an idea worth continuing. Hopefully in the future, we'll be able to finish more of the features we were looking forward to like multi-category support, in app communication systems, and multi-platform support.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">eureka</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mmdrawercontroller</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapkit\">mapkit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CliffLee/Vendope\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CliffLee/Vendope\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the app", "", "", ""]], ["Free Food Hunter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Free Food Hunter \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/247/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Free Food Hunter \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/248/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Free Food Hunter \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/249/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Free Food Hunter \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/250/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Free Food Hunter \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/251/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are a bunch of foreign first-year graduate students in UCSD.

All of the unique restaurants of America have fallen to the waist side. There are many apps that show you better food options; however, none help plan out where to eat in respect to reaching the final destination. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>dtour gives you control on the open road.</p>\n<h2>Competing Categories</h2>\n<p><strong>IBM BlueMix</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Leidos Smart City Challenge</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Qualcomm Disrupt Challenge</strong></p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We started with the Google Maps Directions API v3 to display the initial route from start to destination. Each leg of the destination had a travel time which we summed over until we exceeded one of our target times. This is a good first step but in the case of a freeway this leg could be a huge region and wouldn't provide a good estimate. Once we knew which step our target time was on we found the average rate at which a vehicle would cover that leg by dividing distance by the travel time. Each step also has an encoded polyline (unicode pairs of latitudes and longitudes) which we decoded and then used the geolib package (basic geospatial operations) to estimate the distance between each of these pairs. Finally we summed the line up until we reach where we estimated the target time to be. This process was applied for a various number of times to fit each meal time. After finding these coordinates we plugged them into the Yelp api to find the best food along the route. Since we had so many API calls to make, we decided to use NodeJS for our backend allowing us to asynchronously call all these APIs at every point. Finally, to host our application we used IBM Bluemix for its ease and simplicity.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Since this was our first time using NodeJS we ran into problems with organizing the asynchronous calls. One major problem involving asynchronous calls is filtering the restaurants based on if they are open when the users path comes near them. Yelp's API does not have the closing and opening times of the restaurant so after loading the list of 20 restaurants from each of the meal time locations, we would then run them through async.detectSeries through the Google Places API which has the businesses hours for most restaurants. The subsequent cascading of the returned restaurant was quite difficult to implement.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>There were many tricky elements to this project namely, learning a new ecosystem and solving problems with asynchronous calls. We are both very proud to successfully launch our first node app that elegantly utilizes external api's. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Large volumes of data can be extremely powerful when utilized correctly. Our project accessed only a fraction of what is possible and still achieved results. This is telling of the potential that data has on the making impactful change. This project has given us an appreciation for smart cities as well as a deeper understanding of asynchronous calls, Node.js and api functionalities.</p>\n<h2>What's next for dtour</h2>\n<p>Our future involves fun and necessary detours. Fun detours such as national parks and concerts help show the culture of an area and bring joy on sometimes long and tedious car rides. Necessary detours such as hotels and gas help make the car ride more efficient and less stressful as the user will be informed on the best (AKA cheapest) places to get gas and the most comfortable places to sleep after an tiring car ride. </p>\n<p>We would also like to explore the social media aspect of saving and sharing dtour routes that users have taken. A mobile app would help facilitate this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lukasfroehlich1/dtour\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lukasfroehlich1/dtour\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Full stack.

However, it lacks the social interactions that traditional classrooms provide that is crucial for younger students. My dad saw that I was taking some classes online, so he wanted me to inspire my middle-school-aged brother to take online classes as well. School at that age is a social learning experience that online education can't provide. This inspired me to want to create an engaging classroom environment for middle school and high school students. Virtual reality is currently the best platform for this experience, due to its fundamental feature of immersion in which the students feels like their peers are sitting at the desks next to them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Virtual reality classroom is a virtual classroom where the teacher is able to give interactive presentations that are built to take advantage of virtual reality. The presentation system support traditional powerpoint slides, giving the teachers a way to naturally transition their current curriculums into virtual reality. More importantly, the presentation system also allows teachers to load interactive 3D object into the classroom as part of the presentation. These interactive objects could be a human brain model, a dissection frog, or anything that 3rd party VR app makers produce. The presentation system enables the teacher to teleport the class to any environment imaginable, allowing for virtual field trips or situation-based learning. The teacher can control the presentation easily while wearing a VR headset through gestures recognized by Myo. The teacher can swipe left and right through each slide, which could consist of a traditional powerpoint slide, a 3D object, and/or a 3D environment. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built this classroom in Unity in C#. We looked online for help on the majority of the tasks we had to do, and there were a lot of old guides that we followed. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team had no prior knowledge of Unity or 3D game development prior to this hackathon, so we faced a lot of little issues that we had a hard time with due to our inexperience. For example, we had a few problems lighting up the classroom without glitchy shadows appearing everywhere and providing the multiplayer functionality. We also had some problems learning the technologies due to the lack of up to date resources online, since the oculus rift required a newer version of Unity. We originally planned on using the LeapMotion controller to provide the student the ability to manipulate the 3D objects, but it kept crashing our project so we weren't able to.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to create the multiplayer environment successfully, and dynamically load 3D assets into the scene as part of the presentation. The skybox around the classroom provides a surprisingly real sense of being there in Greece or Japan or on top of mountains. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Unity and 3D game development. We also learned the hardware restrictions of the Myo and the LeapMotion. </p>\n<h2>What's next for VR Classroom</h2>\n<p>An online hub for developers to post their VR assets and for teachers to easily find these assets to apply to their curriculum. The multiplayer functionality is very crude right now, as it requires hosting a server on your machine and connecting via IP, we can improve by using Unity's new multiplayer server solution. Finally, we need to add hardware for the students to interact with the 3d objects, which could be in the form of Oculus Touch.</p>\n<h2>NOTE: Our project is too big to be uploaded.

In the United States, <em>nine people are killed every day</em>, and <em>one in every four accidents</em> involve the use of a cell phone. We realized that with today's technology making it easier to make sense of the physical world with software, these deaths can be prevented with an app for phones.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Lockyroad is an app that solves the epidemic of distracted driving by using existing or aftermarket Bluetooth accessories to determine if the vehicle is in motion and whether or not the user of the phone is the driver. Rather than disabling touch for any passenger of a vehicle, the app is able to sense how close the user is to the driving console or another Bluetooth-enabled accessory to determine if it is in fact the driver. When both of these conditions are fulfilled, the app disables touch for the user until the app recognizes that the user is no longer in vehicular motion.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built Lockyroad for both iOS and Android to connect with a Myo armband to simulate a Bluetooth car console or a Bluetooth-enabled keychain on the keys of the vehicle. It uses new Bluetooth 4.0 technologies to get a measurement from the Myo called RSSI, or received signal strength indication. To determine whether the vehicle was in motion or not on Android, we used geolocation API's to calculate the velocity of the user's position over an interval of time. On iOS, we tapped into CoreMotion and the newer iPhone motion co-processors that analyze the user's speed and gyroscope data to differentiate vehicular motion from other motion (like walking, running, etc). </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>In order to make Lockyroad compatible with as much technology we could, we developed the iOS version as a <em>framework</em> that allows developers to drag-and-drop car safety into their app. The implementation is only two lines of code for app developers, and we were able to test this with open source apps such as <a href=\"https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>. When we initially thought of this, we did not realize how difficult it would be to adapt to every situation of view controllers, such as game layers or custom views. We were able to in the end work out a number of hacky but creative solutions that enabled us to make it compatible with a game, a utility, and a messaging app. It also proved to be a challenge to connect to the Myo and obtain the statistics we needed with the precision and rate that we required, especially with our limited resources. We pulled it off with an iPhone 5s (bare minimum hardware requirement for the project) and an MLH Amazon Fire Phone (which is now running Cyanogen Mod 11).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Being a prolific JavaScript developer most recently, \"re-teaching\" myself Objective-C was an excellent exercise for me and has made me excited to pursue native projects in the near future. As for Albert, he took an AP Computer Science-level understanding of Java and in just 36 hours taught himself how to create Android applications and connect them to a number of high-level native API's - for a phone with relatively scarce documentation.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Lockyroad</h2>\n<p>Lockyroad was originally meant to be an Arduino-powered hack, and we have ambitions to create hardware for it in the future to make it a custom solution that can be attached to keychains and even sold in the future. We also are actively looking into ways of authenticating different users and managing different driving situations and use cases. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://lockyroad.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lockyroad.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>lockyroad.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the frontend development for the Android version of Lockyroad built from scratch which was developed along side the iOS version framework.\n", ""]], ["System Builder VR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"System Builder VR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/318/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"System Builder VR \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/319/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"System Builder VR \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/320/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"System Builder VR \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/300/321/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you looked inside your computer? It's not a black box, there is a network of modular component all connected together, each with a specific role. Let's get connected and share knowledge of computer components through an immersive educational retail VR experience.\nInterested in building a computer? We use virtual reality to show players how to assemble components together to build a custom computer. \nTrouble finding the right components for you custom system online? We integrate with online retailers through slice, and provide text-to-speech through IBM bluemix to give players an immersive user experience.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The player is set in a virtual environment through the Oculus Rift VR headset in a modern apartment loft with a motherboard, graphics cards, RAM, CPU, heat sink, hard drive, and power supply in from of them. Players are able to select components using head tracking from the Oculus Rift headset and pull information for the components through integrated APIs. Text-to-speech is utilized through IBM bluemix to read component information to users when they select them. Players are able to select and relocate components into correct positions in the motherboard and are given a confirmation when they are placed correctly by locking them into place in the motherboard. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this experience using Unreal Engine 4.9, C++, IBM bluemix API, and Slice API</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble integrating external APIs into our Unreal Engine environment we created. There were also issues with user input devices, we had initially tried using a leap motion controller to allow players to grab components with virtual hands, however the leap motion software API does not support this feature and infrared tracking on the device is substandard for practical application. We settled for mouse and keyboard input controls.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Beautifully rendered hardware components and environment.\nText-to-speech integration\nIntuitive user experience design</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>bluemix API integration\nEnhanced skills with C++, Unreal Engine, blueprint, and 3D modeling.</p>\n<h2>What's next for System Builder VR</h2>\n<p>We plan on finishing out the goals that we had set out at the start of the product development, and will be releasing our experience for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift devices that are launching to consumers toward the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016. Our work was done in conjunction with the Virtual Reality club @ UCSD and a small Southern California Nanotech startup NanoVR. We would like to integrate our user experience with NanoVR to help them consult with their customers interested in building custom VR facilities. Education is our top priority and we hope many players will learn how to build their own custom PC through System Builder VR. Full integration with online retailers for a seamless user retail experience, and component compatibility checks are next on the list.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unreal-engine\">unreal-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/slice\">slice</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on controls, ray tracing, environment, and website", "Used IBM's Bluemix TTS API to add audio readout for the different computer components that are to be setup.

However, when taking a laptop and going elsewhere you normally don't take your monitors with you or maybe you don't have multiple monitors. But, we would somehow like to have the similar level of productivity we would have at home. So we came up with Virtual Screens.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Virtual Screens uses virtual reality technology to emulate multiple monitors. You look into the VR goggles and you will see multiple screens. You can then move windows into the different screens and turn your head to view and focus on them. You can also use them while lying on your bed, while your away from your computer, the possibilities are numerous.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We had Google Cardboard at our disposal so we created an Android application using the Cardboard SDK and Java. We also created a desktop application in C++ to control the windows. The two applications communicate with each other using UDP on a local area network. Physically, you have one monitor so what the desktop application does is it brings into focus (to the front) the window that's on the current virtual screen the user is viewing (focused on). Then it takes screenshots and sends the data to the android application where it is rendered. The other screens not in focus are not updated but are continued to be rendered from the last frame.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We encountered a lot of bugs due to UDP networking which was fairly new to us in terms of actual programming. The Cardboard SDK which was also quite new to us used OpenGL and so we had some rendering bugs. We also had some wifi issues since our phone and computer couldn't connect to the same network due to different frequencies. In the end we used our phone's hotspot capabilities to get onto the same network.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Some of us had never done Android programming, UDP programming, VR programming, amd OpenGL programming before and so we are very proud of the fact that we managed to learn all these in just a few days and that we built applications utilizing them as well.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about UDP communication programming, Android programming, VR programming, and OpenGL programming. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Virtual Screens</h2>\n<p>We still have a lot of ideas that we could implement for Virtual Screens such as augmented reality, more gesture actions, etc. and we think this project could possibly be marketable.

Information is segmented between different pages which makes it hard to plan schedules for the present and the future. We wanted to change that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We built a chrome extension which takes all the information about a class, usually split between different pages, and displays it all on the list of classes.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Javascript inside the chrome extension to manipulate the various pages on which the course information was shown. When a user requests certain information, the extension fetches the webpage in the background and displays the relevant information from that page without loading a new page.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We faced several issues throughout the project, mostly in trying to reveal a lot of the obscurity in how the GOLD website operates. One of the first was in trying to send a form to the server to get back the data we needed but without the user's webpage reloading. Alongside this was an issue where the page we got back from the server when we submitted the form through Ajax appeared to be different than the page that loaded when the user would just click on the link to the page. It turns out this was just due to obscurity in the location of the content on the webpage and we were soon back on track. The second large issue was the presence of Javascript buttons in the content we were injecting into the page, which when placed inside the page for two different classes, would interfere with each other's operations. We had to do some reformulation of the design and the exact operation of the extension and in the end got it working in a different way than how we had originally planned.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of the fact that we were able to improve the experience our fellow UCSB students will have when registering for and viewing classes. This is the first time working in-depth with Javascript for all of us so we're also proud of all we were able to do in such a short time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about how GOLD operates, both in displaying content and fetching pages. We also learned how Javascript, and JQuery with it, can be used to manipulate those features and use them to customize the website as we see fit.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gold 2.0</h2>\n<p>We have a lofty vision for the future of this project and it's hard to choose where to start. We're looking towards customizing the extension to the user's major and remaining graduation requirements, improving the look and feel of the extension, and much more. The brainstorming for this one still hasn't stopped among our team.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/returnexitsuccess/SDHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/returnexitsuccess/SDHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["BargainApp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BargainApp \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/868/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BargainApp \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/869/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p><em>p.s.

Download link in 'try it out'.</em></p>\n<h2>Bargain App</h2>\n<p>I grew up around a culture of bargaining and haggling (in India and Jamaica) and I saw that it was an inefficient system. Non-locals often had to pay much more, and people who had less time to bargain or were less experienced hagglers also paid more than what the item is really worth. It was also bad for vendors as well as they were often selling at inconsistent and inefficient prices (rather than at the market equilibrium price which would bring maximum profit) and their scope for expansion or scaling was limited.</p>\n<p>The app is a proof of concept. It consists of a search feature that allows users to search for an item and its details as well as an add item feature that lets users add an item (and its price and vendor) that they just bought to the public database. If I want to buy an apple, I see that it has been selling at a dollar, so I will know that the vendor is still manipulating me If (s)he offers to sell it for $3 and lets me bargain down to $2. If this app becomes popular and widely used, it will automatically remove the need for bargaining/haggling as prices of all items in the surrounding area is public knowledge. Over time, prices will become constant for all buyers and will change according to the market equilibrium, which is fair to both the customer and vendor.</p>\n<p>This was my teammate's and my first hackathon and we are both new to progamming and hacking so it was a challenge for us to get done what we wanted to in such a short period of time. I spent more time learning about angular.js and ionic framework than actually working on the idea. But we managed to make a functional app that shows off our idea, but couldn't implement a database and other features that we wanted to such as a 'take a picture' option, geo-tagging, and a rating system within time. However I am still happy that we managed to make an app and we will continue working on this till it becomes a polished app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionic.viewapp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ionic.viewapp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>play.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ionic-view/id849930087?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ionic-view/id849930087?mt=8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>itunes.apple.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the idea and worked on adding the search feature and add item feature.", "I helped work on the design of the user interface for BargainApp."]], ["liveComment", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>liveComment</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://polar-woodland-3735.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://polar-woodland-3735.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>polar-woodland-3735.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Self Checkout", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Self Checkout \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/908/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Self Checkout \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/909/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Self Checkout \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/910/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Self Checkout \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/911/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Technology continues to increase the efficiency and speed at which we complete everyday tasks.

By beating the game at certain times, the device collects data and saves it onto the Intel Edison. </p>\n<p>By completing one of three core principles of the project, we hope to create a device that could very well replace the simple tasks that nurses routinely make during their runs. Ideally, we'd want to develop a device that could automatically collect temperature readings, blood glucose levels, O2 levels, and patient activity while asleep/active. This information can be easily obtained via a smartphone app and could even potentially have a live feed of the patient via camera. The various sensors could alert the nurse of anything that could be out of place even if there are a large amount of patients. </p>\n<p>Lastly, we wanted to develop a form of feedback for patients, similar to an AI with positive encouragement. The device would ask how you are feeling and then come to a conclusion according to the various pieces of information and feedback recorded from the devices. From there, it would be able to provide words of encouragement or a joke to make the individual feel better. </p>\n<p>With the medical field growing larger everyday, efficiency without neglecting quality is becoming a goal many hospitals with to achieve.

Many of her spectroscopes were breaking down, and they are too expensive to replace. This greatly hindered her lab's ability to quantitively measure things on a molecular level. I made this hack in response to Ann's need. It detects fluorescing quantities in the cell, counting molecular entities in a cheap, portable manner.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FluoroFinder finds the intensity of Green Fluorescent Proteins (GFP) in a given sample. It does this by first shining blue light into the sample. This excites the GFP, thereby causing them to emit their characteristic green light. This light then passes through a green filter, after which it is detected by a photo cell. The measurements made by the photo cell are then converted via python scripts into intensity readings that one would expect from an average fluoroscope.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built the FluroFinder using the parts generously loaned by TouchTiles, including an Arduino, a photo cell, and an Adafruit touch screen. I programmed the touch screen to allow the user to control when measurements take place. I also built a 3-D case that houses a removable cuvette for sample holding, while also keeping ambient light from exciting the sample. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge is gathering fluorescing material for testing the device. In order to test if the device worked, it would be ideal to get cells that express GFP. To address this challenge, design specifications were inferred from previous research done on GFP.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud that I picked up HTML 5 and CSS fairly quickly, and I am close to building a website for the device. I am also proud that I eventually got the Arduino code to coordinate the photo cell, LED, and touch screen, which was not an easy task. Designing the plastic housing in Fusion360 from scratch, and seeing the printing of each piece, was also fairly rewarding. </p>\n<p>However, above all, I am most proud of the fact that this device will help high schoolers get a better education. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Thanks to the SD Hacks workshops, I learned how to code in HTML 5 and CSS, and I now have access to a tutorial on how to build a web app full stack. I also learned how to interface the Adafruit with the Arduino, and I became acquainted with the precision of the 3D prints made by RoBo printers.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for FluoroFinder</h2>\n<p>I would eventually like to build the \"SmartPhone Lab,\" complete with attachments for microscopes, fluorometers, and scales. This would allow a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to be as simple as plugging in your iPhone.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adafruit\">adafruit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Yggdrasil", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yggdrasil \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/891/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yggdrasil \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/892/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yggdrasil \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/299/893/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>The Quest for The Sacred Water is a text based RPG, akin to a choose-your-own adventure book, where the players are able to take multiple paths to complete their story.

But for programmers, laziness is efficiency. Instead of opening Google Maps and entering a destination, locals familiar with an area may find it more convenient to quickly check the bus arrival times for nearby bus stops with a web app in one click. And by using the Google Transit GTFS data format, this web app can be made to work with any area with publicly available transit data.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>As soon as the web app opens, it sends the current time and your geolocation to a server, where GTSF files (transit data) published by the local transit agency are parsed and relevant information is sent back and displayed, including the closest three bus stops and the next three arrival times for each bus line that stop there in either direction.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The standard HTML/CSS/JS was used for the front-end, and Node.JS/Socket.IO was used for the back-end. The front end-handles displaying the data and the back-end handles organizing and consolidating data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Parsing through the GTFS data was more complicated that we had imagined.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Putting together my first web app.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to use Node.js and Socket.io.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cloud Bus Checker</h2>\n<p>Next would be the addition of a database to go along with Node.js in order to make data retrieval faster.
