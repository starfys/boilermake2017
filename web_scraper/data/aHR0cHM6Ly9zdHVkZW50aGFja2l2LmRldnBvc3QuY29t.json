All the websites online assume that you have an idea of which area(s) of town you would like to live in. However, being an international person I have had no idea of where I should stay. However, I had a pretty clear idea of where I will be commuting to every day. Therefore, I created Finder - property search aggregator that will look for property based on the place you will be commuting to every day. This is a major change that allows a person who doesn't know much about the city or are to get to searching a place to stay pretty much straight away</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Finder looks for property based on your place of commute (university, workplace etc.) and intelligently calculates the monthly expenses value. The latter includes rent, bills, transit fees and any other additional expenses. Therefore, you will be able to compare the properties at a glance and will avoid manual computations when, for example, comparing bills-included properties with non-bills-included one.\nAs commute-oriented search, Finder also shows how long it will take to commute for you every day. As a result, you are able to balance cheaper rent with longer commute times easily.\nFinally, Finder presents the information on the property and neighbourhood in straightforward graphical way (with the help of a map and images) and delivers smooth user experience throughout the whole search.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p><em>The scale of the project is quite big, so I was working off an assumption that property search is done within London area.</em></p>\n<p>Finder can work with multiple property data providers, but is currently using Zoopla API to fetch the list of properties. It then works out the nearest transit point (Tube, Underground, Overground or DLR station etc.) and determines how much you would spend on the transport every month (e.g., via monthly Oyster) via TFL data. It also calculates typical commute time with the help of Google Maps Directions API. If the user likes a property and chooses to Discover the area, Finder uses CDL data to work out how safe the area is (based on number of accidents happening around the property) and what is the average age of people in the neighbourhood. Finder also enhances the data by showing various commerce/local businesses around the property and place of commute with the help of Yelp API. This helps the user get idea of what kind of area they will potentially moving into and find out any local businesses (like restaurants, bars etc.) to visit once they move.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I had to learn the API for each service in a short time and use it efficiently whilst working around the rate/quota limits. This was a huge challenge that was relevant throughout the whole weekend. CDL data posed a challenge as well, as ElasticSearch is quite difficult to get into - especially as it drifts away from strict SQL concepts into the realm 'should conditions'. I was also trying to register a domain with a domain.com for the project - the system didn't work for me. My most recent challenge, which is literally what I am battling with now, is deploying the app on Azure Cloud.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am really proud of putting making the application that is able to intelligently combine the data that is already out there on the web in order to create a simple and intuitive interface. Despite the fact that the application looks quite simplistic to an average user, it is pulling off a lot of work in the background and combines the data from <strong>6</strong> datasources! (London stations data, TFL fares data, CDL data, Zoopla API, Google Maps directions API, Yelp API).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learnt more about APIs and process of development for applications that heavily rely on maps and directions. I also  got acquainted and learnt more about ELK stack and managed to write a couple of queries on my own despite hugely uninformative and unhelpful error messages ElasticSearch gives you :D</p>\n<h2>What's next for Finder</h2>\n<p>Extending the set of property providers, slowly adding support for more areas (currently only London area is supported) and transit options (e.g., biking). Finder strives to become a SkyScanner of the property market - a website that aggregates the data from all the different providers, enhances it and provides an intuitive way to navigate through it. </p>\n<p><strong>The demo link for Azure Cloud is available - please don't spam it, as I might run out of request limit/quota. Use Google Chrome if you can, as I cannot guarantee that it will work in all browsers!\nYou are more than welcome to come to Table #39 for live demo off my laptop as well.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yelp\">yelp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cdl</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/elasticsearch\">elasticsearch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mdl</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://finder-hack.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://finder-hack.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>finder-hack.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on everything #onemanteam"]], ["AskNigel", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AskNigel \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/359/614/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>AskNigel</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to recreate the bear Ted from the movie with the same name.

With many unexpected events and tight schedules, you are more likely to be careless and lose your properties. This is one of the critical issues that most of the people should have experienced before. The Phone Magnet is an absolute solution for those are looking for your lost smartphone with no data/internet connections.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>After installing a mobile application and registering for The Phone Magnet, the smartphone can be tracked its location via any browsers as long as that smartphone has a cellular connection to receive and send SMSs. The application will monitor all incoming SMSs and filter out the messages from the specific number which is the Twilio number integrated into The Phone Magnet tracking system. Once the application receive the SMS from our server, it will trigger and send another SMS with the geolocation information attached back to the browser. Additionally, the smartphone can capture an image automatically and send it along with the geolocation just to add a little more information for finding your phone!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used JavaScript for the website front end, node.js for the server running on AWS that manages all the work and an Android app on the phone, which listens for and replies with SMS after carrying out all the necessary actions. The server uses Twilio to send and receive SMS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The most challenging thing we faced was to send the image from a phone to the server. Moreover, the capturing itself is another difficult challenge because it has to capture without manually using the phone.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We brainstormed the ideas from 'why' we make it. And then 'how' we it would help, and to \u2018whom\u2019. Therefore we proudly came up with the idea of \u2018what\u2019 we would be making, with a clear purpose and a strong belief that it would be used for good.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that sending information such as image is not as simple as we thought. As well as the making of a functional mobile application of auto running when it receives a contact from a specific number.</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Phone Magnet</h2>\n<p>We will definitely develop more additional functions increase the possible of users to find their phones. (ex. voice, dark screen in case of stolen, etc)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">domain.com</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Created the website, backend server and Android app. Integrated Twilio API.

After trying some of them I have realised that you have to interact with the application after each exercise and that the sets of exercises are predefined. Therefore, I have thought of implementing an application which you can speak to, such that it will suggest you your desired type of exercise. Besides that, the music during your training session plays an important role as well. So, we have implemented an innovative way of choosing the right music for you.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>First of all, after the user says how he feels, our application does a speech recognition and then NLP Sentiment Analysis, in order to start the music that fits your mood best. The next step is to mention what would you like to train more exactly. After a speech recognition and a NLP algorithm, the desired exercise starts together with the music we have already selected at the previous step.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The back-end is written totally in Python. We are using the Flask framework, NLPToolkit library and Uberi for speech recognition. The front-end was built in foundation, sass, css, angularjs, jquery.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Time management was a problem and we should also mention the browser and platforms' compatibilites.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>A good looking and functional project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>flask flask flask flask</p>\n<h2>What's next for Personal AI Trainer</h2>\n<p>We have thought of a Machine Learning algorithm , that predicts the days in which the user is most likely to skip his  training.

We added stopping times to the horizontal movements using Leap Motion and added a keyboard input to override controls when the sensors were being difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We managed to create a whole project using node.js, a language which none of us have used before.</p>\n<h2>What's next for DroneLeap</h2>\n<p>Try to improve the Leap Motion gesture detection to drone movement recognition so it would be less dependent on keyboard input.\nAdd extra functions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cylon</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Samrobbo/ARDrone.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Samrobbo/ARDrone.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Solar-Explorer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Solar Explorer is a Oculus Rift educational tool which enables students to view the positions of the solar system's objects both in real-time, and at any time between 3000BC and 3000AD.</p>\n<p>It utilises a range of cutting-edge visual technologies including Oculus Rift, VR-Boilerplate, and Three.JS alongside data from Skyfield to create a fully 3D environment containing orbits and information about each planet.</p>\n<p>We developed this in 36 hours, as part of Manchester Spring GreatUniHack 2016.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We firstly found an appropriate API, to get the positions of planets for a given time. From this we parsed the data into a JSON format. Using this data structure, we passed it into a WebGL instance to provide the arguments for creating accurately sized planets, and used various mesh technologies to overlay maps of the planets onto the spheres.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of our API's for mobile Virtual Reality, BoilerPlate-VR, was partially incomplete and lacked several key function calls which required significant workarounds.</p>\n<p>In addition, no-one in our group had large amounts of experience with Javascript; which we used as a key component of our program.</p>\n<p>In the final hours, a Git merge caused us to lose significant parts of our code-base.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our progress and the workflow manner we adopted was efficient.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt large amounts of Javascript syntax, as well as Node.JS backend and how to use JSON to parse data in a clean and fast manner.</p>\n<h2>What's next for

Or the weather tomorrow? What if you're roaming abroad and want to find the nearest Starbucks ? You don't want to spend a fortune on those few megabytes... With SMService you can get all this information with the service available almost anywhere in the world - sms messaging.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a mobile app which uses sms messages to get data you need</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>App is designed to be fully extensible with various plugins,  we're bundling an HTML5 offline web app within a mobile application and extending the functionality with native code. The server uses django which is a python framework. Twilio service handles the data transitions between app and the server, and server uses other APIs to produce responses.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a lot of integration problems. Every android device behaved differently with the APIs we are using which proved to be a difficult challenge to build on.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have an almost working demo version.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Integrating is hard, also we learn some new API's</p>\n<h2>What's next for SMService</h2>\n<p>We will try to fully finish the project; more plugins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yelp\">yelp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/weather-api-net\">weather-api.net</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I have made most of the mobile app.", "", "", ""]], ["RiseTogether", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are a team of newbies and this actually lead us to the inspiration for our idea used in the rise challenge, our lack of knowledge and experiment that we not only had to rely on each other but on others to. Rise is a facility that empowers individuals by providing them with a space to work and innovate, something that many take for granted. We wanted to build appon this by adding a sense of community to a space of talented individuals and allowing them to network and build of each other.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Rise Together is a local area social network that is designed from the ground up to allow individuals to connect with people of differing ability, build together and help one another. Get. Give. It allows users to find others in the rise build that have skills or talents the complement your own, helping you to achieve your goals. It also allows you to build a network of contacts that maybe useful in the future.   </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>It was built as a web platform to allow easy access on any device that a user may have, we achieved this by using a MySQL database to store user data and create relations and PHP to access, evaluate and update this data. HTML5 Geolocation was used to verify if users were the in rise building or accessing from elsewhere.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We are all amateurs at best, this was our first hackathon, we are complete stangers, one member of the team had never coded before, and the other half had never seen PHP at all. The odds were heavily stacked against us from the start but we over came these issues and somehow developed something that resembles an actual product</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Geolocation was a welcome accomplishment that we did not expect, the amount we have all grown as developers in such a short time is astonishing.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Alot, from new languages like PHP and SQL, how to work well with others and share knowledge to the fact that I am now too old to pull an all nighter... twice.</p>\n<h2>What's next for RiseTogether</h2>\n<p>Polish, this being a hackathon, there are bugs... lots of bugs and we would like to fix them. On the features side we would like to do more with the information on who is in the building, provide user locations on internal maps and possible add a messenger section</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://risetogether.kamalosman.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://risetogether.kamalosman.co.uk/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>risetogether.kamalosman.co.uk</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kamaltmo/riseTogether\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kamaltmo/riseTogether\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Rippass", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Rippass \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/359/676/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Rippass \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/359/677/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Inspired by zombies</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Opens peoples eyes to accidents that have happened nearby and opens their brains to feed the zombie hoard</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>in visual studio in c#</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>getting things from the server</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>getting things from the server</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>posting html requests to get data</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rippass</h2>\n<p>very little</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Safe Party", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Party \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/359/641/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Website Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Party \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/359/642/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Party \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/359/643/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Example result</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Since we are in a city full of students, partying is one common activity.

There are some ways to screen for it with various kinds of imaging such as ultrasound, CT scan or an MRI scan. However it is important to know which people to screen. This app helps us to detect key symptoms early on and analyse patterns that match diseases.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is an iOS app with a Python/Flask backend that receives input from the user of various symptoms including light-headedness, breathlessness or palpitations - especially during diseases. It records various metrics such as length of symptoms and heart rate which is then sent to the server. This information is then presented as a graph back to the user and also flagged to the doctor if the symptoms are deemed sufficiently urgent in presentation.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built this app with an iOS front end and a Python/Flask backend.

As we can actually decrease the amount of casualties.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We thought it would be a great idea to add a new feature to google maps, based on the type of route you want to travel on. There is shortest path, fastest path but there is no safest path. So we created an application to give you choice of safest and most dangerous route to travel on.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use Google's maps API and CDL API which contains data of over 1.6 million entries, of all incidents with police presence on the territory of the United Kingdom since 1973. It includes number of hurt people, how bad they are hurt, the reason of the accident, and many other data on which basis we created a very accurate algorithm that splits that data in 3 categories. Slight incidents, Serious incidents and Fatal accidents. Then we extract the URL for a route lets say from point A to B in Google maps, we put it in our app. Then it runs the algorithm finds the safest path between these points, after that it draws it in a static google map in our app (we could have made it navigate you, but Google's navigation API is private and it has paid license). It then shows you statistics of how dangerous actually this road is.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had hard time figuring out the algorithm, we also ran in to a bug in our server so when we were near end our PHP just broke down so we had to re-write in python.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We worked as a team, we had some fun and we actually built something that makes sense and can be useful.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to deal with problems on the goal and improvise.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Safer</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/elasticsearch\">elasticsearch</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]]]
