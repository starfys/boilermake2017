Through this belief, we decided to create a robotic animal companion able to take the place of a household pet. Our target audience is anyone who cannot afford to adopt an actual living animal, from city dwellers who live in no-pet policy apartments to the elderly who simply cannot take care of a live animal. Statistic show that there is 1.4 million elderly living in nursing homes that cannot own pets in the United States alone; however, elderly subjects with pets live longer than those without by lowering cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, and encouraging more exercise. By providing a robotic companion, we are able to fill that void for the elderly. Additionally, the drone pet can also be extended to those that are allergic to animals and to children that are not yet ready to take on the responsibility of a live pet.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>After hours of brainstorming, we decided to combine the power of the Myo armband with the Parrot mini drone to create a intuitive pet drone that will respond to human gestures similar to a live pet. The drone pet can perform basic tricks like \"sit\", \"come\", etc. The unique aspect of our project is that the drone is not simply controlled with the movements recorded by Myo; instead, a movement or combination of movements will create a response from the drone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, this drone is not the best model for our project. The drone battery life is only 1 minute after every full charge, which is not practical for everyday usage. The drone also does not have a sensor to know where the \"owner\" is standing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>building 4 different parts to the final product \nOur team tackled 2 new technologies that we had no previous background knowledge. In addition, we have connected 2 different technologies that not many people have previous thought of. When we ran into issues connecting Myo and the drone, we were able to look deeper into the Myo software and built a Morse code outputter that responds to arm movements recorded through Myo.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MyPetParrot</h2>\n<p>Currently, the appearance of drone cannot be changed. We want to add AI to the drone so that it can empathize with user, display \"emotions\", and respond to being stroked and hugged. In addition, we want to make the appearance more realistic, like Hasbro's Joy For All ultra realistic robot pets. Our first step is to create a canine and feline version since they are the most popular household pets.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vikashkothary/mypetparrot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/vikashkothary/mypetparrot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["rippleblitz", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"rippleblitz \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/753/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The many past students and professors at goldsmiths that create computational artwork.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users join the site and can place hexagonal nodes around the screen at a simple touch or click.

In the minutes after the the end of the Opening Ceremony, it became obvious that creating a social plane ticket app would be something genuinely useful for, especially for us, students, who have friends from around world, from so many countries it's hard to remember to you've visited and who has been left out. With this in mind we were inspired to create D\u00e9rive.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>D\u00e9rive is a social flight booking app. It uses Facebook as a basis for it's data, gathering the user's own check-ins, to know what cities he/she has visited. Simultaneously, it uses the same access the gather the 'lives in' data on the user's friends. Thanks to this we know countries where the user hasn't been but has friends. We then list these countries for the user to choose his/her next destination.\nOnce the users decides we present all available flights from the current location to the target country, with the SkyScanner API, with the option to show a small wiki of the city in question, by presenting a map and a small blurb bout the city from WikiTravel.\nAs a fun plus to our app, we created a simply WatchKit app, that can randomly assign you a country to visit if you can't choose.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We realised early that the app will be a challenging one so we split it up into 4 parts.\nNatalya worked on the image data which we initally tried getting from Foursquare but in the end resorting to google places/images. Jakub worked on gethering the wiki data from wikitravel. Both of them being completely new to Swift and iOS. Samuel worked on the Facebook API access and later on the UI of the app. David worked on the SkyScanner API and digesting the incoming data.\nWe used CocoaPods to help us deal with network calls faster and with less hassle.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a number of challenges.\nTwo of the four member team had no experience with iOS or Swift therefore they attended the Swift workshop.\nEarly on we decided to use CocoaPods to save time and energy, but as none of us has used it before, we ran into phantom errors on some machines which didn't appear on the others.\nWe found out that the Facebook API is much less flexible then thought with it only allowing access to user list if the user also has the app downloaded. Due to this for the hackathon we hardcoded locations and people.\nThe Foursquare API was also a disappointment, being too hard to effectively use in 24 hours therefore we switched to google's API.\nFinally, none of us has ever written a WatchKit app, therefore making sure it doesn't kill our app and it works properly needed extra precautions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the app as a whole but there is more.\nWe met here, literally over 5 seconds at the team-making event, nonetheless we became a well oiled machine in minutes. We worked together to solve problems such as CocoaPods and teach each other Swift and JSON serialisation. \nWe survived the sleeplessness of the hackathon, while creating an app which non of us could have imagined creating in a week, much less in 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned (more) about Swift and WatchKit. As well as Facebook's, Foursquare's, WikiTravel's and Google's APIs. We learned to use (and hate) CocoaPods.</p>\n<h2>What's next for D\u00e9rive</h2>\n<p>We had big plans we know we couldn't accomplish in 24 hours. At some point for a few hours we had a version of the app which used P2pKit's local discover API to find your friends when they get close by in the city you are just visiting. We wanted to expand upon this using their beta functionality to guide you to your friends in unknown cities.\nFor the hackathon we stayed simple and used cached data from SkyScanner, we'd want to include full live functionality with the power to buy the tickets.\nLastly, for our app to be truly functional we would need a lot of users. The more users the more data we could get from Facebook, without hardcoding it. Therefore getting it on as many phones as possibly would be a next big step.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/skyscanner\">skyscanner</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">p2pkit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wikitravel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/geckosk/derive-final\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/geckosk/derive-final\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["MMORPS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Because rock paper scissors !</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mmorps.esy.es/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mmorps.esy.es/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mmorps.esy.es</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["stuff", "", ""]], ["RefConnect", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RefConnect \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/888/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RefConnect \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/889/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RefConnect \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/899/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The idea for the project was inspired by the events happening throughout Europe surrounding the refugee crisis and the need to connect people in need with volunteers who are willing to provide helping hands. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The mobile app connects independent volunteers with refugees who are in need of support in the new country.

(For any linguistically challenged people reading this, that's the French word for house.)</p>\n<p>This app is designed to create tasks for housemates to ensure everyone is aware of what needs to be done, including who needs to be do it and when it should be done by.

(See screenshot)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Maison</h2>\n<p>So much more. Easy bill splitting system transactions (we'll deal with the messy money situations). More (non passive-aggressive) functionalities to hassle your housemates to get stuff done. And of course, an even prettier UI.

Essentially, the system provides you with three words to start a sentence (from a database, chosen randomly). Users then have a set number of seconds to suggest what the next three words should be.

So we tried to build an application where a group can subscribe to an event, they all can then be tracked on a map and in crowded places the user is also notified who is around them. So they can easily keep track of everyone. Hence to fulfill this basic need of human beings, me and my friends came forward with our knowledge and made something out of it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is basically a tracking application built for people going clubbing and partying to keep track of their friends. It can track a person's movement and uses a p2pkit to notify the user when his friend is around. It could also help people know who has left the place and who has not. Also we have incorporated a small chat module which enables the people going for the event talk and discuss things. But this application is not only limited to people who are going out it can be used for many more real life events.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our application is divided into two part, an android application(acting as the front end) and a node.js back end server. The android application is built using fragments with loads of HTTP requests whereas the back end node server runs on Express framework and uses leaflet.js to render the map for tracking purpose. The android application carries the p2pkit and the pusher module to keep the server and the client in sync.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since our team had only two members and one android phone it was a challenge to test whether the app actually worked. But one of the hackers lent us his phone so that we can debug the app. Other major challenges include using JAVA :P</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our application and the amount of work we have done on it. Even though we had a small team we divided our work pretty well and were in sync with each other all the time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that the size of team doesn't matter, what matters is your will to create something nice, something beautiful to make others life easy.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Overwatch</h2>\n<p>One can think of multiple improvements for Overwatch, one being the ability to show multiple events, better login methods and better event handling. Also developing an admin back end would be nice. Though we have released a beta version of the admin end(basically to see whether the app works or not) with some functionality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pusher\">pusher</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">p2p</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">p2pkit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nginx\">nginx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/npm\">npm</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/SomeRandomTeam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/SomeRandomTeam\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the android application.
