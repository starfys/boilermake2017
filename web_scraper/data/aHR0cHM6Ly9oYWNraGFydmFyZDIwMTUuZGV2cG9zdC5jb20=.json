What inspired us for this project was our love for robotics and our determination to create a robot that can be navigated using a Myo. This robot will provide visions to places where access are restricted. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Myo Explorer will perform our declared commands through different motions using the Myo sensing technology. It can also have a <a href=\"http://myo.cloudapp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">livestreams</a> of what it \"sees\" through its journey. The livestream is broadcasted on the Microsoft server aka Azure's platform through the Ardunio Yun's local network. Devices that connect to our Yun's local network will be able to see what the Myo Explorer is up to.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The body of the robot itself was created using four DC motors, an arduino Yun board, a motor shield and a voltage regulator along with the body of the car. We built the app using multiple languages and technology. We built an Android app through <strong>Android Studio</strong> to receive the Myo's command and transfer it to the Yun. \nNext, we implemented a webcam through the Yun's USB port, and created a web page through simple HTML/CSS to stream the video footage recorded. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>-First hackathon - so we didn't know what to expect. We have a lot that we wanted to implement but did not have all the time to do it.\n-There was an initial delay in the processing of the signal that was emitted from the armband, an issue that was combatted through a change of the android app's implementation from <em>switch-case</em> to <em>if-else</em> and creating a variable that tracked the position of which command was sent so there is only one command at a time. \n-Building the robot was a challenge since we aren't very familiar with connecting DV motors to sources. It was hard to get the motors spinning in one direction.\n-In order to use one battery we needed to create a voltage regulator since the arduino board is powered by 5V and the motors use 9. We had to build this by hand through a schematic we found and then perfected since the extra resistance did not work in our case because of the material resistance. \n-Programming the MYO was a challenge since it is a completely new technology and we did not know anything about it from the start. It was not very precise and took a lot of trial and error to finally get it to respond to our commands.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>-Being able to finish a project as it is our first hackathon ever\n-Smooth operation of the Yun. \n-Successful build of the robot with all the components neatly tucked into the body of the robot to create a visually appealing robot. \n-Using the MYO as a controller is an incredible accomplishment for us since it is a unique way to control a robot.</p>\n<h2>What we've learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about robotics, about building a robot from scratch and working with electronics components. We learned how to program a unique remote to work with an android and how to stream live video through a webcam connected to a microprocessing board. We learned how to work as a team that has never met before. We learned more about android development and how to use http protocols to not just webpages. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Myo Explorer</h2>\n<p>The Myo Explorer next step would be to connect tools like lifts and shovels to be able to lift objects with. Create a sturdier body to be able to go into rough terrain. creating more unique controls with the MYO tool to control speeds. The Myo Explorer could also use its webcam to not only stream but record videos in the future and use to teleconference to users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yun</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dc-motor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://myo.cloudapp.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://myo.cloudapp.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>myo.cloudapp.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Vicos4/MyoController\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Vicos4/MyoController\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["We built the car body all together.

This comes from the fact that they have never experienced those abilities before.</p>\n<p>According to Microsoft\u2019s Inclusive Design Booklet, \u201cIf we use ourselves at a starting point, we can end up with products designed for people who are young, English-speaking, tech-literate, able-bodied, and right-handed. Plus, those with money, time, and a social network. If we\u2019re designing for ourselves as a baseline, we can overlook people with circumstances different from ours.\u201d</p>\n<p>So how can we change this? First, we looked at how other design fields (such as industrial design and architecture) try to conquer human diversity. A few great examples of this are the <a href=\"https://www.oxo.com/products/preparing/peelers-choppers/swivel-peeler\" rel=\"nofollow\">OXO Potato Peeler</a> that was initially created for people with arthritis and the first electric toothbrush, the <a href=\"http://www.electricteeth.co.uk/the-history-of-the-electric-toothbrush/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Broxodent</a> that was initially created for people with mobility impairments.</p>\n<p>Our conclusions from these inspirations were the same as Michael Wolff (founder of Wolff Olins): \u201cWhen you include the extremes of everybody, that\u2019s to say differently abled people of all sorts, then you produce things that work better for us all.\u201d If designers create work for those with different vision abilities, their designs will be more legible for everyone.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By simulating different types of vision, the app increases designers' awareness of abilities different than their own. The designer using the app experiences it through a Google Cardboard. When the app launches, the designer selects the visual ability they would like to experience and learns key information about that ability. They can choose viewing the world from the perspective of someone with color blindness, peripheral vision loss, or contrast sensitivity. If designers start to view their work through this lens, they can adjust accordingly to be more inclusive.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Camera</strong>\nUsed built-in camera of Android phone to extract video data.</p>\n<p><strong>Filters/Image Processing</strong>\nUsed OpenCv and Python Image Library to create original filters from color-blindness calculations. Transformed those calculations into Java.</p>\n<p><strong>Combining the camera and filters</strong>\nConverted the data from the camera to images, applied filters, then pushed new data to the user\u2019s screen in real time.</p>\n<p><strong>Cardboard UI</strong>\nUsed Unity and OpenGL to create the 3d interface through the Google Cardboard. Used phone\u2019s accelerometer to make the user feel like they are in this augmented reality. </p>\n<p><strong>Design</strong>\nUsed Sketch to mock-up final UI, that will be implemented at a later time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Cardboard has little documentation</li>\n<li>Live streaming and live processing data in real time causes lagging</li>\n<li>Live image processing in Android is not generally supported</li>\n<li>Calculating the color-blindness values</li>\n<li>And lastly, of course, time</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Focused on end users needs without getting too caught up in the excitement of technology</li>\n<li>Learned new techniques</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Cross disciplinary teams are key to success</li>\n<li>Android Image Processing</li>\n<li>Developing for the Google Cardboard</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Insight</h2>\n<p>After the hackathon:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Finish UI</li>\n<li>Add pages with information about the different abilities</li>\n<li>Introduce the app to designers and get feedback</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">python-image-library</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opengl\">opengl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Shounak/InSight-HackHarvard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Shounak/InSight-HackHarvard\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Created the concept behind Insight.

Since traditional seizure and epilepsy monitoring technologies are limited to capturing data over relatively brief periods of time, which can generally be measured most commonly in minutes, occasionally in days and rarely in weeks. With Seisir data can consistently be captured for days, weeks, months or even years without interruption. Not only does this expanded timeframe give Seisir the opportunity to become extremely valuable from a clinical and diagnostic standpoint. Seisir can monitor individuals routinely during periods of change during sleep wake cycles, a time at which seizures are more likely to occur. It is our hope that Seisir can provide a new benchmark in the tools to combat SUDEP, seizures and epilepsy. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Seisir pulls data from a Microsoft Band, through the app, and then uploads the information to a secure server. Once an individual's data is on the server, Seisir takes advantage of Microsoft Azure to analyze data in real-time using an advanced machine learning algorithm. The program then contacts one's family members and medical staff by way of text messaging in cases where the machine learning program detects a high likelihood of seizure activity. In plain terms, Seisir has a strong potential to save lives by notifying others in emergency cases. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our program in it's entirety utilizes a combination of technologies starting with the Microsoft Band. A bluetooth connection to our android application is established with the band to obtain a variety of sensor data. This information is then passed through the android application to Microsoft Azure on the cloud. Using Microsoft Azure's machine learning platform, our program identifies seizure activity from the sensory data originally derived from the Microsoft Band. The cloud system responds to the android app in moments when seizure activity is found. Upon receiving a seizure alert from Microsoft Azure, the android app notifies emergency contacts via a traditional text message. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since the Seizure platform requires integrating a combination of multiple different technologies, devices and programming languages. This cross compatibility created the majority of our implementation challenges. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully developed a machine learning algorithm using Microsoft Azure that can detect seizure simulations with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. We understand that our hack uses a limited dataset, but we are excited by the initially promising results. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team learned a great deal about Microsoft products. We believe that Seisir demonstrates that Microsoft Band and Microsoft Azure have significant clinical applications. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Seisir - Epilepsy Monitoring App</h2>\n<p>It is our hope that the Microsoft technologies behind Seisir have the opportunity to be used in a research setting that is clinically relevant to seizures and other epileptiform activity. Since one of our team members interns within the neurology department at Boston Children's Hospital and works with epilepsy patients on a daily basis, it is our hope that the Seisir / Microsoft combination platform have the opportunity to be tested within a clinical setting. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phpmyadmin\">phpmyadmin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://seisir.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://seisir.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>seisir.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/IAmMiho/Seisir\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/IAmMiho/Seisir\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Prophit", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Prophit</h1>\n<h2>Welcome to Prophit!</h2>\n<p>Just as Netflix makes recommendations about movies you would like to watch, \nProphit makes recommendations to Capital One customers about stores they would \nlike to try.

Lots of people suffer terribly from them, and we, as a medical community - don't know that much about them. Our project seeks to address two major issues in the field of burn injuries:</p>\n<p><strong>1) Diagnosis through Quantitative Metrics</strong>\nStatus quo diagnosis of burn wounds is left to the eye of the burn surgeon/dermatologist, as per the following 4 characteristics; Depth, Cause, Appearance, and Level of Pain. (<a href=\"http://hospitals.unm.edu/burn/classification.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diagnostic Parameters</a>) Of these metrics, the distinction of depth is often unclear externally, the latter two are arguably immeasurable objectively, and the last often has no standard of comparison (which complicates the entire diagnostic system). This uncertainty manifests itself in the relatively high variance of burn diagnoses for identical images in double blind studies, even amongst leading dermatologists in the field.</p>\n<p>By measuring burn depth by proxy with a newly substantiated biometric (heat, as a function of collagen denaturation), one can objectively determine the damage and full topography of the wound. 2D thermal images can be processed, and using the linear nature of heat conduction, can use 3D temperature levels to indirectly derive wound topography. </p>\n<p>Much like an iceberg, a burn only demonstrates a small amount of the wound externally, where there is extensive tissue death beneath the surface both immediately, and uniquely - experiences continued apoptosis after removal of heat stimulus. </p>\n<p><strong>2) Noninvasive Injury Progression Tracking</strong>\nCurrent widespread method of depth and wound analysis is done through invasive biopsies. Not only do these inherently disrupt the wound healing process, but they only give one unique data point per biopsy. Due to the organic/nebulous shapes of burn wounds, however, these 'guessing points' from biopsies do not nearly paint an accurate picture of the state of the entire burn. In fact, depending on where they are taken, they can improperly generalize the state of the entire wound and lead to incorrect, or at best, quasi-arbitrary dosage information. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Takes a 2D IR image as an input, creates a dynamic 3D model, computes pertinent wound properties, diagnoses burn degree, calculates post-trauma fluid requirement.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Python serves as a middleman by taking a 2D orthogonal thermal image from our iOS/Android frontend input to our Mathematica script on the backend, called via the Wolfram Cloud Platform RESTful API. Image is decomposed pixel by pixel, assigning a given Z (depth) value to each coordinate in the XY plane based on the RGB color value from the original image. Points are then restructured and plotted using Wolfram 3DMap and Plot functions, smoothed to a surface of Isotherms, exported, and handed off to our front end again using Python for dynamic 3D Visualization. Further analytics are processed using Wolfram to attain values for <strong>burn degree</strong>, various other burn characteristics (<strong>surface area, volume</strong>), and estimated recovery time (note: varies significantly per person, so it's fairly inaccurate, but we wanted to implement the capability as the body of research attains a more accurate rate function).</p>\n<p><strong>Minimum fluid requirement in 24 hours post-trauma</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkland_formula\" rel=\"nofollow\">(as per the Parkland Equation)</a>, is calculated, an essential treatment parameter for burn victims. \"Burned Body Area %\" is a fairly difficult value to attain for most people, so we offer a much more intuitive system that includes either estimating the wound size relative to the effected limb(s) (see: [Wallace Rule of Nines])(<a href=\"http://www.remm.nlm.gov/burns.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.remm.nlm.gov/burns.htm</a>), or even easier, a 'Draw' option onto a vectorized body, which then automatically computes the % wound coverage by comparing altered pixels to original pixels.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We don't have any thermal camera hardware here, but there are multitude that exist in industry (Nick worked with a couple in the past when he conducted Dermatology research at Stony Brook Medical Center). If possible, we would want to work with the new <a href=\"http://www.flir.com/flirone/display/?id=69324\" rel=\"nofollow\">FLIR One</a>. They are small enough to easily be transported for medics or emergency personnel, and can seamlessly be integrated with either iPhone or Android phones into any medical professional's repertoire - whether it be a large hospital or a small private practice. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were pretty stumped and demoralized, not coming up with a project idea until Saturday morning.</p>\n<p>None of us have any mobile dev experience, and we were still able to push functioning (and arguably, good looking) iOS AND Android apps. We literally coded our first lines in Android Development Studio and Swift 24 hours before this was submitted. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for 3Degrees</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Improving relative size accuracy by implementing more precise depth calibration. </li>\n<li>Integrating some sort of infrared camera to directly streamline the entire diagnostic process from image capture to analytics and injury progression tracking.</li>\n<li>Make things prettier.

Hipsters fear no more!!! hAIkuu sees and interprets your image, and uses in-house AI natural language processing algorithms to craft deep haikus that your artsy friends can't possibly criticize.</p>\n<h1>The Problem</h1>\n<p>Whether you can't seem to find the right words to describe a scene, or you just want to finish your morbidly long haiku homework, hAIkuu can generate a completely unique haiku for you. Never feel sad or bored again! With hAIkuu's  ability to make the cutest haikus ever, you'll feel better about yourself the next time you stay up 'til 4am doing all those computer science problem sets. Not a fan of cute? We got you, it also makes depressing stories that you can send to your enemies.</p>\n<h1>Technical Difficulty</h1>\n<p>Our system uses the Clarifai API to classify the images you send, and then uses our in-house NLP haiku generator. We used two layers of algorithms to generate haikus that make sense. Firstly, n-gram generation using the Word Association Network. Most NLP systems use WordNet or similar synonym based graphs, but we realized that literature and poetry require creative links, which our WAN provided. The second layer analyzed our scraped database of 3000 haikus to understand how sentences in haikus are formed. This involved knowing which word was of which part of speech (noun, verb, etc.) and mapping our n-grams to the right format. We used Azure and a Python backend to put everything together.

However, when we tried to input new data through the frontend to be recorded into the backend, there was no response. After trying to troubleshoot issues for naught and getting nowhere trying to figure out Azure and iOS compatability, we switched gears to Azure's Storage system and tried to implement blobs and tables as our backend. We built a version through Java, but was inefficient. We switched to iOS, but was unable to get it running because the Pods we downloaded for Azure's Storage SDK had dependencies that were not updated. Lastly, we coded Azure Storage through C# and Azure Storage Client Library, but because of our laptop's extremely short battery life, the work got lost when we were moving.

After that, click on \u201cScheduloo\u201d, the system will automatically calculate 6 best combinations of the courses entered based on their time conflicts and students\u2019 intentions. (Hongbo got a \"optimal\" schedule to enjoy a long weekend every week! -- Shown in example picture)</p>\n<p>Scheduloo is very easy to use and save students from lots of handwritten work for scheduling courses.</p>\n<p>The data we use for Scheduloo comes from the University of Waterloo Open Data API ( check <a href=\"https://api.uwaterloo.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://api.uwaterloo.ca/</a>). The API provides large amount of information about the university\u2019s services, including courses, food, weather, news, etc. The information is organized in a tree structure and it is easy for programmers to access it.

We could not add a feature that took control of camera directly (and had to resort to upload an image option instead). We were unable to test the app on our phone using our camera and photo gallery, hence, we do not know how easy/hard the game is, as only the images available with Clarafai's api's where used (very limited).

Bringing affordable VR education tools to classrooms. Inspired from using clay to model objects. With technologies like the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion available in the market we thought up an idea which has been recently gaining traction: online collaboration. We hope that in the future people can use our product and learn something new, if that happens then we have accomplished our mission.</p>\n<h2>What we do</h2>\n<p>MotionLab is a software which allows users to interact with 3D models. Our website currently lets users upload 3D models which other users can download for educational purposes. These 3D models also come with tags that the user can place on the model, this can help students learn about the structure of objects.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Currently allows the user to interact with a 3D model and add tags to the model and share it on the web.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use Oculus rift and Leap motion to interact with the 3D models inside of Unity. Our application uses gestures and physics so that the user can interact with objects. For example, poking the object will allow the user to place a tag on a certain part of the object.Website was built with PHP, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Amazon Web Services.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we encountered</h2>\n<p>Collision detection in Unity was limiting so we had to make custom collision models.\nVR is hard to control because of the lack of precision from leap motion, tagging is not optimized because it has issues in the VR environment but works in 2D. Time was limited because our project is very broad. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We actually got it to work in such a short amount of time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Working with Leap Motion and Oculus for the hardware, and learned how to use Unity.</p>\n<h2>Our plans for the future</h2>\n<p>We are planning to provide an affordable way for students to improve the way they learn. Our product can also help experts in the field with their research or work. Finally we are also hoping to make our application accessible via the internet which means people will be able to collaborate with friends and colleagues online.</p>\n<h2>The Team</h2>\n<p><strong>Darrin Fong</strong>\nI have always been into DIY projects since it's so satisfying to realize you created something after you pour your heart and soul in something you love doing.

Therefore, we are <strong>making it as intuitive as possible</strong>!  </p>\n<p>Accordingly, <strong>our service simplifies and streamlines the web development process</strong>. It does so via two basic template offerings and by providing the necessary variables to auto-generate a desired site for each user. It also features a simple, formulaic URL, which is fully customizable with a backslash and the user's uniquely desired name. </p>\n<h2>Current target users</h2>\n<p>For <strong>photographers</strong> who want to showcase their unique portfolio of works, <a href=\"http://swyte.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swyte</a> will automatically funnel pictures and information from a user's \"About Me\" section already posted on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a>. </p>\n<p>For aspiring <strong>bloggers</strong> looking to share their introspective thoughts with the world without sufficiently advanced technological skills to do so, <a href=\"http://swyte.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swyte</a> swaps their dreams for an instantly incredible reality. </p>\n<h2>Social impact potential</h2>\n<p>Since this service can take information solely from text inputs for website creation as well, it could <strong>extend web presence visibility</strong> beyond its current realm to those from emerging market countries, such as individuals from parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, who do not yet have such access <strong>merely through the use of rudimentary mobile devices</strong>, or non-smartphones. </p>\n<p>Pursuant to the newly introduced <strong><a href=\"http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sustainable Development Goals</a></strong> of the United Nations, we believe this piece of technology could further encourage Quality Education, Goal Four, and foster Decent Work and Economic Growth, Goal Eight, within the international community as additional divergent viewpoints become available to all. </p>\n<h2>How we are building it</h2>\n<p>So far, we have been using Facebook and Twilio APIs, node.js, and wit.ai.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://github.com/Swyte/swyte\" rel=\"nofollow\">our Github</a> for this project to learn more. </p>\n<h2>Next steps for <a href=\"http://swyte.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swyte</a></h2>\n<p>While it incorporates <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a>, we believe <a href=\"http://swyte.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swyte</a> could also draw automatically from photos in <strong><a href=\"https://instagram.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a></strong>, given text commands. </p>\n<p>A <strong>color palate</strong> and <strong>additional template themes</strong> should also be available for users.

Surprisingly, two-thirds of them earn a median income of $41,000, which puts them well above the federal poverty level.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>***  Millennials, fair worse than all generations in terms of saving.  Meaning adults who are 35 and under, have a personal savings rate of negative 2%. Between high student loan debt and stagnating wages, saving anything at all proves to be impossible for many of them. </p>\n<p>Thank you, </p>\n<p>The YoungMoney Team</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/capital-one\">capital-one</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/FreemanLou/YoungMoney\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/FreemanLou/YoungMoney\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front-End.", "Frontend and Backend", "Front-end. \n"]], ["Buoy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buoy \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/649/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buoy \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/650/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buoy \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/651/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buoy \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/652/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My little brother, who has Asperger's Syndrome, was my inspiration in this project. I noticed his difficulty in recognizing facial expressions and understanding social cues from an early age. These problem areas have caused him a lot of stress and frustration, and so by choice he stays home and avoids social interaction - not the best life for a 17-year-old! I wanted to create something that helped him and others with similar diagnoses aged 13+ to identify, track, and help mitigate symptoms of strong emotionally-tied events, namely, \"meltdowns\" and anxiety/panic attacks. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>\u201cLife has its ebbs and flows. If you\u2019re on edge, let buoy help redirect you.\u201d\n1) Adding and tracking specific emotional events \n2) Emergency contact and methods of communication - creates and stores \"emergency contact\" text drafts and lists help hotlines\n3) Stress management and relaxation techniques\n4) Activities to link triggers and their associated methods of stress alleviation for that individual</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I brainstormed on Google Docs, designed a mock app over Google Slides (a slide per screen), then helped push tickets for front-end code using GitHub and Android Studio from my and Daan's laptop. I made the logo in Adobe Illustrator.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>My computer crashed the first day and I lost a lot of my files. My OnePlus One wasn't working when I tried to emulate, so it definitely delayed programming. A mentor tried to help me fix my Android Studio because that emulator wasn't working either, but we didn't have any luck. A majority of my work was done through pair programming and using my teammates' computers. It was also time-consuming to research ASD and appropriate ways to construct the app, but we wanted it to be credible.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>About 80% of the original design was completed, with wonderful additions from my teammates. I started a content workflow early which really helped streamline the creation process. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned more about Android development, mobile drivers, and back-end development. I also am grateful for the workplace experience I gained by collaborating with developers of different styles and skill sets.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Buoy</h2>\n<p>The UI needs to be refined - new fonts, colors, layouts - to be more aesthetically pleasing. The buttons and font could be bigger. I think we were too focused on cranking out a product in time. Adding more stress-alleviating activities and games, along with creating a dashboard of all the data collected, is also next up on the list.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wHavelin/HackHarvard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/wHavelin/HackHarvard\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Did a lot of the Android side.

Sunaina is a graduate student there. The neuroscience field is burgeoning, especially with the new neurotools. This is giving insight as to how we develop to learn, think, and execute at the fundamental level--these are images from fMRI to EEG. This provides the precise prime windows as to when the brain is at it's prime plasticity moment and start providing experiential exposure or training then. This leads cognitive tasks that can be done at the prime time to not only enhance a child's development but also prevent (as much as possible) developmental disorders. Basically, it comes down to the concept that everyone has the capability to enhance in their developmental skills, from math to reading.</h2>\n<h2>What it does; Using your child's age as well as if they have any developmental disorders, we provide specific cognitive training tasks for the parents to do with their children.

around the world, social media is enabling extraordinary activists to connect with those around them who are passionate about the same issues. However, the current tools for activism are lacking in organization. Protest and meeting planners have to juggle Facebook groups, twitter, and other platforms just to get their message across, and many people end up left out simply because they don't know how to find like-minded activists.</p>\n<p>Reactivist is here to change that.</p>\n<h2>What is Reactivist?</h2>\n<p>Reactivist is a social app designed with both professional and lay activists in mind. Our name is a play on words; we exist to help ordinary people to react to activism, and to help organizers to reach out to everyone who's interested in their cause. Anyone can find and connect to like-minded activists in their area. Groups can discuss current events and their shared cause on the group's dedicated page, which is open to anyone in the area who is interested. Push notifications allow those on the scene to organize impromptu meetings and protests with all those interested nearby.</p>\n<p>Part of the beauty of Reactivist is that it enables activists to keep up with the unexpected twists and turns in life. It allows quick communication between large groups of people, providing an easy way to publicize and organize events with very little overhead. Thus, a protest or a debriefing meeting can be planned and enacted within minutes.</p>\n<p>But it's also beautiful because if its simplicity and ease. A user can use it as they like, with no pressure. Join many groups and feel no pressure to participate in any but the most important events, or join only a couple of groups a play a part in leading the movement. Wherever you are on your journey through the battered road of activism, Reactivist to help you along the way. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flux\">flux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I did the Android front-end.", "I worked on a lot of the front end design and some of the backend. \n", "", ""]], ["Arbitr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are oft stuck in a deadlock, two or more parties, unwavering and unyielding to the other parties.

Our platform takes patient coding DNA sequences, normally provided from commercial DNA sequencing companies to physicians, identifies specific genes within the query and the location of individual mutations, the level of risk they pose to the patient, and determines a patient-specific drug treatment plan informed by personalized genetics, drug interactions, and side effects Each suggested therapeutic includes a brief description of its molecular mechanism of action and a link to the scientific journal reference paper that includes further molecular interaction information.</p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>In the status quo, patients often have to undergo a \u2018trial and error\u2019 process of multiple classes of chemotherapy until one begins showing efficacy in cancer treatment, causing unnecessary patient harm and ballooning healthcare costs. This is because cancer therapeutics, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy, target individual proteins and/or cell signaling pathways affected by individual genes mutations rather than a certain class of cancer, such as breast or lung, alone. </p>\n<p>Oncologists are increasingly using DNA sequencing to determine which drugs are uniquely suited to the mutations driving their patients\u2019 tumor development. However, while sequencing is increasingly easier to order and its cost is dropping at a rate exponentially faster than Moore\u2019s Law, most DNA and biotechnology databases that correlate raw genetic information to clinically relevant mutations are difficult to navigate and cater to basic science researchers instead of the needs of oncologists and other physicians. Furthermore, no platform has aligned data linking DNA, associated tumor mutations, and clinically-validated treatments in one place, making it difficult for physicians to make use of patient genetic information to inform treatment decisions. Similarly, navigating clinical trial information and registration is difficult and it's hard to match trials to individual patient risk factors. </p>\n<h3>Our platform streamlines the process of moving from a raw DNA coding sequence to a personalized, first-line FDA-approved cancer treatment and ongoing clinical trials matched to patient gene data in just one click.</h3>\n<h2>Instructions</h2>\n<p>Input human patient coding DNA sequence into the text field. Hit 'Submit'. Our algorithms use sequence alignment and gene prediction to identify genes commonly mutated in breast cancer within the query and locate specific mutation sites. Using this and extensive drug and clinical trial databases, our servers correlate patient-specific genetic mutations with the optimal, gene-specific therapeutic options.</p>\n<p>Our analysis and predictive algorithms are supported by extensive empirical and clinical data regarding genetic mutations associated with tumor development. To learn more about our empirical data sets and search engine, contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@memorahealth.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">info@memorahealth.com</a>.</p>\n<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>\n<p>Building this project posed a variety of technical challenges. To help with multiple developers working so closely over a short span of time, we decided to break the project out into three microservices and a separate web interface, all hosted on Microsoft Azure. We also dynamically pull in the list of ongoing clinical trials for all of the recommended medications specific to a patient's mutations. Genetic sequences and individual mutation locations were carefully encoded to make searching for genes (and their mutations) fast and scalable.</p>\n<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: DNA2Drug does NOT offer medical diagnoses or advice, nor do we promise such.

Modern browsers lose a lot of rich information when they compress browsing history into a linear stack, and backtracking from a forrest of links is surprisingly difficult. We wanted to fix navigation in a way that was both quick, reliable, and predictable for power users, and also beautiful and intuitive for beginners.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>\u2014 Visual History is a Chrome extension that delinearizes your browsing history with a richer alternative to the Back and Forward buttons. Instead of a stack of previously visited destinations, VH maintains the forrest of trees that represent each tab\u2019s path along the internet, and lets the user easily backtrack to any site they recently visited. Routes that normally have to be manually re-traced by users, like jumping between search results or forum posts, can now be intuitively and quickly directed without revisiting the parent page. Power users can use keyboard shortcuts to quickly navigate around the graph.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built VH using standard web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, as well as the D3.js visualization library. We developed on both Windows and Mac using both WebStorm and Coda, with Github for version control. Red bull and Insomnia Cookies also contributed to development.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since VH is a Chrome Extension, everything is technically frontend. On the backend of the frontend, we had to locally track every page visit since the Chrome History API does not provide enough information to tell us the path that the user took to arrive at a given page. This had to be recorded in a custom tree data structure that was maintained per tab across pages.</p>\n<p>And on the frontend of the frontend, we had to modify core elements of the D3 standard package to visually display the nodes and links of the path. Since D3 does not include APIs for having a partiulcar element selected, we had to design custom UI elements to show the user their current location in the tree. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Neither of us have made a Chrome Extension before, but our vision of Visual History only works if it is integrated in the browser \u2014 so we needed to make a Chrome Extension. In under 36 hours, we went from just knowing that extensions exist to having a deep understanding of the system, and having a fully working product.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how Chrome Extensions work and how to make them (including safely modifying the DOM, modifying keyboard shortcuts, and getting snapshots of URLs and favicons). We also learned how to use the D3 visualization library. One us had very little experience with JavaScript, so we also improved our JavaScript abilities. Finally, we learned a lot about how to (and how not to) divide and conquer problems in code and merge those changes in Git.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Visual History</h2>\n<p>In the future, it would be great to port the extension to be available in other browsers (including Safari and Firefox). We also want to add screenshots of the webpages (instead of simply favicons). Finally \u2014 in the future \u2014 it would be great to make a mobile version of the extension as an app. Since iOS sandboxes browser history, this would involve writing parts of a web browser ourselves.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tears</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joeltg/histree\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joeltg/histree\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Kenny worked on the frontend of the frontend.

Also, the version of Mathematica that was installed on the Pi was far outdated, and did not include the drivers for communicating with the Arduino.  This set me back for many hours, and when I finally resolved the issues, there were only about 12 hours left.  I also found a bug in the Mathematica libraries for Arduino that caused some strange issues with the PWM, but eventually found a way around it.

The ultimate goal is to get the user to a more stable mental space where they have the better capability or desire to reach out to other support networks or hotlines, which we provide. Since the usage rate for these hotlines can often be low because of the inherent obstacle in just opening up to a living person, this app lowers this barrier, building rapport with the user and making them more apt to reach out to a better support system.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>In our group of four, two people had basic experience with the Java language and took charge of the coding. The other two team members had no programming experience, and focussed their efforts on designing both the content and interactive elements of the app. This involved a fair amount of research.\nThe coding of the app was slow at first - neither programmers had ever built a whole mobile app prior to this project and one had never used AndroidStudio before. As the design half of the team completed flow charts describing the behaviour of the app, the programming half divided tasks between themselves to implement the desired features. The program structure ended up being quite simple - simply a series of connected \"activities\" that formed a survey-like experience, with the added dynamic element of shortcuts to dial emergency services or the National Domestic Violence Hotline. By collecting data from the user we were able to tailor the nature of the advice given by the app, hopefully resulting in a more relevant and helpful user experience. The design team spent a great deal of time developing questions and carefully phrasing advice that was incorporated as text in the app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>None of us had ever built a whole app before. Not very familiar with the Android API. Had to spend a fair bit of time teaching ourselves how to code basic program elements (such as images and checklists). Was not always easy to spread the work out constantly through the team as the design and code often progressed at different rates.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The app works much as we envisaged it. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Sleep is a precious thing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Domestic-Violence-Support-App</h2>\n<p>Perhaps further smoothing out of the GUI.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BaneOfSociety/Domestic-Violence-Support-App\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BaneOfSociety/Domestic-Violence-Support-App\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["CBBAS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>CBBAS was inspired by our previous work with biomarkers in the human voice.

Usually, EdTech follows gaming trends, making them less than cutting edge for kids and as a result, not very \u201ccool\u201d. We wanted to turn this on its head, integrating 3D sensing cameras into a full motion adventure for kids to teach them math.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>T-Rex allows kids ages 7-11 to learn basic math skills up through geometry and basic algebra. It uses a 3D-motion sensing camera to allow kids to help T-Rex on his journey through the tropical island of Pythagorean. Along the way, the kid must help T-Rex solve basic math problems as T-Rex tries to find his way back to his mother. Solving the math problems and clues along the way present a problem for T-Rex, but with help from his friend, T-Rex works his way back to find mom. Using the 3D motion camera, kids don\u2019t type in a number, they actually show T-Rex using their hands. It is no longer an EdTech on a screen, rather kids interact with the game just like they do in school - using their hands as they learn to count and solve basic math problems. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built T-Rex by dividing our work into 3 distinct silos: full motion programming, scene and animation programming, and storyboarding. We built the scenery using Unity, a gaming engine with built-in physics. We used Blender for 3D modeling and animation, and photoshop for 2D graphics. We used an Intel Sense API in Unity to develop the 3D motion-sense gestures. We then integrated all of this work together and added in the \u201cadventure with math\u201d, allowing kids to use hand motions and gestures to navigate T-Rex through the island of Pythagorean.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Challenges we ran into were tracking the fingers as we integrated the 3D sense technology. We also had some initial problems with the physics integration of the movements for T-Rex.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Integration of 3D technology in a way that is useful for small kids to learn with. EdTech is rarely a first integrator with leading technology, so we are proud that we have found a venue for effective integration for education. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that 3D sensing technology can be very finicky and difficult to get right. We think the technology is almost there, but still think it needs small improvements before this can move to a full beta version.</p>\n<h2>What's next for T\u00fcter Rex: A Full Motion Adventure  in Math</h2>\n<p>We see T-Rex as a potential model for revolution in EdTech games - having kids use their hands and voice to learn math, especially at young ages where kids want to use their hands to show numbers and count. This could be especially useful for children with speech disabilities to learn basic math. We plan to submit this alpha version to the Intel Realsense team for their potential integration and development in their future development of this technology.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">intelsense</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the storyboard develop and overall \"strategy\" for the game and the target market development.

By adding gesture controls the band has been given a pathway into a numerous amount of industries and opportunities. For example, modern day cellular devices are filled with options and menus that can be overwhelming for an autistic individual; however, the band\u2019s improved user experience allows for such a user to have a simplified experience. This allows these individuals to easily send emergency messages/ calls if needed without being bombarded by the complexities of a full cellular device. </p>\n<p>We believe that the new gesture control features of the band also opens the doors to a new genre of mini-games \u201cwrist games\u201d. Imagine being able to control a side scrolling runner with gesture controls on your wrist. </p>\n<p>Thanks to gesture controls, the Microsoft Band has truly become a device which can upon up your world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Jessjeanjo/OpenTouch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Jessjeanjo/OpenTouch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the Android application, integrated the Myo and the Microsoft Band, and created the Android UI/Logo Design.", "", ""]], ["Cookie-Factory", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Contemporary internet authentication systems suck.

Users enter a the title of a movie they enjoyed and Cinemaku begins working, by crawling the web to find stills of the movie. Using the Clarifai API, these movie stills are analyzed and digested to yield a set of \"tags\", which describe the visual content of the movie based on some of its most important scenes. By doing so, Cinemaku is able to identify certain visual aspects of movies that appeal to viewers which maybe unknown to them. After tags are identified, Cinemaku again takes to the web, this time leveraging the capabilities of Google Search API to find titles with similar visual characteristics as determined using the Clarifai API. After detailed visual analysis of numerous movies, users are presented with an ordered list of recommendations! </p>\n<p>Cinemaku derives its name from cinema and 'maku', the Japanese term for 'recommendation'. We were inspired to create this product after noticing an alarming underappreciation for the visual aspects of film. We believe that elegant cinematography is, at its core, the art of creating beautiful motion pictures. Cinemaku aims to fundamentally alter the way movies are appreciated in the current day, by returning viewers to the roots of film. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/edwardshe/Cinemaku\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/edwardshe/Cinemaku\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Wanna Hang?", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wanna Hang? \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/323/557/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When I want to hang out, I want to hang out now.

Ensuring the safety of our city/community is our utmost priority.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>\u2022 Our Mobile application is the public's side while our Web application is our private's side.\nWhen a user takes a photo of a crime incident they attach a description with a hashtag of the the type of crime or any other categorial data. We then transit this image to the server and apply multiple recognition scripts to try and indemnify the license plate number or the face of the criminal. Once all the data has been processed and categorized the server will display this in a clear and concise way for the police to see. If the police have inquiries or would like to know more about an incident they can click on it and view all the details as well as related incidents of the same Case ID.</p>\n<h2>How it was built</h2>\n<p>\u2022 For the Mobile part we used Android Studio and Java. \n\u2022 For the Web application part we used HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP.\n\u2022 For the Server we used AWS as well as some PHP Scripts \n\u2022 For the Custom Graphics we used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>\u2022 Difficulty transmitting data/information across the network\n\u2022 Understanding the information visual hierarchy and what the user needs (Learning to use Photoshop and Illustrator)\n\u2022 Retrieving info from the server and updating all the information as well as using the Google API to create the map.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>\u2022 Getting the data transferred through the network and to the destination (The AWS Server)\n\u2022 Properly implementing the Camera API and utilizing it to gather data.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>\u2022 How to use the networking tab in Android Studio to track data transfers\n\u2022 How to efficiently use SQL and Google API's\n\u2022 The basics of product design and Adobe Tools\n\u2022 How to create a great design from the ground up</p>\n<h2>What's next for Legality</h2>\n<p>\u2022 Dark Mode: Your phone goes dark (It looks like its off) but its secretly recording Audio/Video.
