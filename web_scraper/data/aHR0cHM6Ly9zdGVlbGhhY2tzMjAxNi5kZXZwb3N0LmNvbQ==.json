We hope that MLH and HH would take the appropriate actions to clear this incident up.</p>\n<h2>Response</h2>\n<p>I\u2019m currently looking over the comments posted above, and I\u2019ll try my best to explain myself out here.</p>\n<p>Firstly as many of you mentioned above, this project is not from scratch. We\u2019ve credited our code to the original authors in our Github repo, as it wouldn\u2019t have been possible without their contributions to the A-frame.io framework and to the WebVR community.</p>\n<p>In addition, (especially because we did win an award from MLH and wanted to avoid \u201cplagiarism of code\u201d), I\u2019ve personally contacted the original author after the weekend and mentioned him that we used his code and discussed how we can appropriately cite his code and he said that a mention in a github repo is enough. People in the a-frame slack community took notice of our project and they provided us with a nice comment about our project.</p>\n<p>Both the original project and our project sourced our graphics from the same place (a template file included with MagicaVoxel). However, to implement the various animation and additional effects that is included with our project, we\u2019ve significantly modified the original file by breaking it up into several components, as well as creating original objects to complement the initial template. We\u2019ve also put in a good amount of time to figure out how to make the exported object file from MagicaVoxel compatible with the A-frame object loader without losing any of the graphical information due to the difference in format. </p>\n<p>Our project is based on open source graphics (the stage graphics is included with MagicaVoxel), and used code that was licensed under the MIT license. From there, we worked to see how we can bring the existing A-frame project further by adding interactivity. </p>\n<p>Now as for the MLH guidelines regarding sourcing open source code, submitting this code for SteelHacks, etc,\nI\u2019ll be waiting for an official communication from MLH and we will discuss how to handle this situation. I believe that MLH will use their best judgement to handle this situation here.</p>\n<p>Finally I request that the original poster remove our link to the DevPost and instead post our link to our github repo. Its posted below and I hope that anybody who\u2019s curious about the project, both in a positive or negative way, take a look at is, as I believe that it will be a better representation of of our project.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/steven77723/Steelhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/steven77723/Steelhacks</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>As for the HP Vertica Award: Honestly, no clue. We have no idea why they called us for the award as we didn\u2019t use it (we never said we used it). That will have to be answered by the Steelhacks team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Original Devpost description below</h2>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our inspiration for this web application comes from one of our members. He loves playing the mobile game, Monument Valley, and we thought that it would be interesting if we could play the game in a Virtual Reality setting.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The whole point of the game is to bring the user from the start position, to the end position. To do this the user has to go to various places in the field to unlock features of the field.</p>\n<p>Because this application is browser based, users can either play through a desktop browser using Oculus Rift, without an Oculus Rift, or through their mobile device using a Google Cardboard.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using a framework called A-Frame, which is built upon the Three.js library. This framework allows us to create the virtual reality world, in HTML and Javacript syntax, and render it on the browser. </p>\n<p>We created the graphics of MonumentVR through an application called MagicaVoxel, which is a 3D version of a pixel graphic editor. Although there was a template similar to our current set up, we had to significantly modify it in order to allow us to include animations and movements in the world.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our largest challenge that we faced was the issue of how to create this application. The original game uses the 3rd-person view to its fullest, creating optical illusions which are the focus of the game. However, since we wanted to fully use the capabilities of Virtual Reality, we decided to create the game in a first person manner. As a result, we had to find a different way of representing the optical illusions so that they would make sense.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating a browser based virtual reality game that can be run on desktop, Oculus Rift, and in mobile (Google Cardboard). </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic HTML &amp; Javascript</li>\n<li>The usage of the A-Frame framework.</li>\n<li>Setting AWS up</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for MonumentVR</h2>\n<p>Although we don't think we will pursue this project anymore, we're excited that we now know how to create virtual reality worlds in the browser, and that we can incorporate it into our next projects.</p>\n<p>You can play with it at jsa.pary or by clicking the link <a href=\"http://jsa.party\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, check out our github pages website: <a href=\"http://steven77723.github.io/Steelhacks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://steven77723.github.io/Steelhacks/</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">a-frame</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webvr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://jsa.party\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://jsa.party\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>jsa.party</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["T2P", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>T2P</h1>\n<p>Text to Image converter</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdxzvQG3aic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tom Scott's \"The Bubble\"</a></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It takes a phrase entered by the user, and replaces all text nodes in  containing that string with randomized images.

Inspired by the relevance of picking up a few phrases and the desire to spend time productively, we came up with this app so that you can learn something even in the few minutes it takes for your morning cuppa to be ready. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app uses your location to find points of interest near you. It generate a short phrase or sentence in a foreign language of your choice that you can easily learn and is related to these points of interest. It then allows you practice repeating it in said foreign language.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it with a Python backend, using the Flask framework and text-to-speech, English-to-xx language translation and the Google Places APIs.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The different intonations in some languages makes detecting speech accurately a challenge. Words within the same language with similar pronunciations make life difficult. Also, limited experience meant we decided not to implement this as a mobile app instead.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>It was interesting to learn about the current standards in voice processing tools. We were really fascinated to discover that there were open source libraries that offered text-to-speech abilities in almost any language or dialect that you'd care to name. This app also gave the both of us an eye-opener into web development with Flask. </p>\n<h2>What's next for geoLingual</h2>\n<p>Stay tuned!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.geolingual.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.geolingual.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.geolingual.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend and cleaned up our landing page's CSS.

The project is then deployed via Docker containers, and displayed in a project list. Users are then able to look through this project list, click on a link, and view their respective project, hosted by our app. This would be beneficial for organizations schools wishing to showcase their students' work.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We take zip files uploaded by our users, and then we unzip them, build a Docker image for them, and deploy the Docker container to the cloud.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Docker Golang bindings were super challenging. Port publishing was nontrivial, as was adding a dynamic hostname lookup as users uploaded their projects. Most of our team was largely unfamiliar with the Go backend, so it took a large effort for the team to become familiar. Time was spent guiding and educating the team, to ensure that not only did we know what was working, for the large part we knew how things were working as well. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of being able to bring this together for the most part, overnight. About six hours ago, we weren't quite sure how we were going finish. Being able to combine the complexity of the backend with that of the front end was difficult, but worth the effort.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The three of us that had never worked in Go before learned all about how Go serves static files, bringing together both the front end and backend. We also learned more about how to go about using Docker in conjunction with Go.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for HackSpot</h2>\n<p>We would like to be able to allow multiple users to have their own profiles, able to submit their projects as an organization. We would also like to enhance the visual features of the site, specifically integrating the project list with thumbnail-style snapshots to give a preview of the page.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docker\">docker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RobbieMcKinstry/steelhacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/RobbieMcKinstry/steelhacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Tudlr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanted a tutoring app to find tutor.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Links people to tutors in subjects they need at Pitt.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>With Android Studio</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Compilation errors with Acitivities.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting a product that's visible.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to make Android apps generally.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Steelhacks2016WOO</h2>\n<p>First place.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Bludhunt/Steelhacks2016WOO\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Bludhunt/Steelhacks2016WOO\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Neo-Hangman", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It's a sort of cross of Hangman and Wheel of Fortune and I thought it'd be cool if you had to buy any letter instead of just vowels</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's just a standard game of Hangman but with a twist: you have a limited supply of letters that the game keeps track of.

However, in our experience we have found very few</p>\n<p>people actually finish one single course. Part of reason is the little commitment and </p>\n<p>responsibility compared to the traditional class. So we propose a new MOOC platform, </p>\n<p>Promisedu, providing users with the power to enforce the commitment to learn and finish </p>\n<p>an online course by using a charging and rewarding system.</p>\n<h2>Tell us about your solution?</h2>\n<p>In order to solve this problem we needed to consider individuals\u2019 motivations and </p>\n<p>where they falter. We weighed the possibility of whether people gave up personal goals </p>\n<p>due to laziness, distraction, or dwindling motivation. Ultimately we arrived at the </p>\n<p>conclusion that it was a combination of these three factors. Many people lead hectic </p>\n<p>lifestyles and trying to add another \u201coptional\u201d task to an already full schedule. We </p>\n<p>realized that in order for people to treat online course with the same seriousness as </p>\n<p>traditional school we needed to remove the mindset of the online course being optional. </p>\n<p>The new pursuit needs to be viewed as necessary. This is achievable through </p>\n<p>reinforcing positive progress towards your goals with one of the most effective </p>\n<p>motivational stimuli, money.</p>\n<p>To register a class, the user decides the difficult level and class schedule by </p>\n<p>themselves. Next, they would then determine how much money they would like to </p>\n<p>commit to finish the class. Once registered, the class will have a twenty-four hour </p>\n<p>alteration and cancellation period. Following this period the amount of money pledged by </p>\n<p>the user will be charged to their account if they fail to stick to the schedule or fail the test. </p>\n<p>If the user is successful the account is never charged, and they even could get some </p>\n<p>rewards based on how much deposit they have paid and how many other people have </p>\n<p>failed (how much money in our pool).</p>\n<p>We believe this is an effective solution to dwindling motivation because the fear of </p>\n<p>losing money actively promotes the user to diligently assess their progress. We know this </p>\n<p>motivation, in combination with the desire to earn money, will push users to fulfill their </p>\n<p>goals.</p>\n<h2>Who are your customers and or end users?</h2>\n<p>This particular system is directed towards individuals who are serious about taking </p>\n<p>an online course. It is applicable to all ages, but particularly to the college students and </p>\n<p>young workers who are eager to improve themselves, but worried about their </p>\n<p>determination. The ability for the user to specify the amount of money they wish to invest </p>\n<p>in themselves opens this app to an even wider range of people.</p>\n<h2>What is your value proposition to customers?</h2>\n<p>Our app provides our users with the best motivational tool they can use to </p>\n<p>directly improve their change of finishing an online course. </p>\n<p>According to class-central.com, the current average completion rate for MOOCs is </p>\n<p>approximately 15%. It\u2019s highly possible that we could improve the rate by a large amount </p>\n<p>of percent. </p>\n<p>Our application solves these problems by creating a contract with the user to remain </p>\n<p>committed to meeting their goals. The user\u2019s fear of losing their deposit and the idea of </p>\n<p>making money while actively improving themselves creates a unique opportunity for </p>\n<p>self-growth.</p>\n<p>Where other applications try to present the quickest and easiest path </p>\n<p>to self-improvement, we know hard work, time, and the correct kind of motivation are the </p>\n<p>only realistic ways of obtaining one\u2019s goals.</p>\n<h2>Our Team</h2>\n<p>Our team consists of one sophomore and two seniors. We are Computer Science </p>\n<p>majors, and I am double majoring in Mandarin. Both of us have experience building </p>\n<p>several Android and IOS applications including a location based restaurant deal finder </p>\n<p>and a live port authority bus tracker. We have worked together on projects in the past and </p>\n<p>look enjoyed building this application. </p>\n<h2>Do you think this project could be a startup?</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s highly possible that we could turn this project to a startup. The application by its </p>\n<p>nature provides a certain stream of revenue and educating our potential users would not </p>\n<p>be expensive. The biggest challenge would be the course resources. But we could </p>\n<p>negotiate the licensing with the established MOOC platform or even turn to the</p>\n<p>university. </p>\n<p>If the application developed into a company I would oversee the product design and </p>\n<p>user experience. These responsibilities would consist of managing design schedules and </p>\n<p>interpreting user feedback. My partner would be responsible for handling scaling </p>\n<p>solutions and hiring new members.

Without any experience in hardware, we decided to start small, and experiment with a Myo armband. 17 hours into the hackathon, we came up with the idea: a massage chair controlled with a Myo.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Through various motions and gestures detected by the Myo armband, one can control the area of their back they want massaged.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>First we set up a webserver to manage communication between the 8 smartphones and Pebbles. Next, we wrote a Pebble app that vibrated in response to HTTP requests from the webserver. Finally, we wrote an interface that generated HTTP posts based on the current gesture or motion.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>From the very inception of our idea, we ran into challenges. The original plan was to use vibration motors for the massaging but they were all checked out. One organizer realized we could repurpose Pebble smartwatches to act as vibration motors but to communicate with 8 Pebbles we needed a Bluetooth module, which all happened to be checked out as well. And thus, we settled with having one smartphone communicate with each Pebble.</p>\n<p>The Myo armband was quite difficult to calibrate and throughout the weekend we had to revise our design in order to match the capabilities of the Myo.</p>\n<p>We tried setting up a website for the application, but we were only able to set up the webserver host due to delays in propagating nameserver changes.</p>\n<h2>What's next for 8Pebbles</h2>\n<p>Since the webserver we set up was a free trial server from Amazon web-services, it will have to be taken down at the end of this hackathon. If we had a finer grained massage array and a finer tuned method of specifying areas on the grid, 8Pebbles could have come close to a working product.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pebble-app</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ec2-52-36-212-178.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ec2-52-36-212-178.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ec2-52-36-212-178.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/edwardcai/8pebblesServer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/edwardcai/8pebblesServer\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sumkit/MyoApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sumkit/MyoApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nmu925/8pebbles\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nmu925/8pebbles\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I made the backend and website and was an overall nice guy", "", "", ""]], ["Iceberg", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>People who are afflicted with both limited mobility and poor body temperature regulation may find getting up to change the thermostat for their comfort difficult.

For design/animation we used HTML5 and CSS3 with Bootstrap.

We know apps like Yelp or Zomato exist primarily to help decide which restaurant/food place to eat at. However, once we pick a place and actually arrive there, the troubles are still not over yet. Now there is a daunting menu with many different options. But how do we pick what to eat solely based off of just the names of the dishes? That's where we found a need for Menyu, an app to easily help one choose a dish once they have already arrived at the particular restaurant.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Menyu is an app that allows users to read and write reviews of individual dishes based on the restaurant he/she is at. These reviews come from other users who have also visited that restaurant and ordered the specific dish. So how it works is that when the app opens, it tracks your current location, giving you some options of food places close to you at the moment for you to indicate where you are exactly. Once selected the location, it continues to a screen of dishes/food items of that restaurant. The items that are shown are ones that have been added into the system and reviewed by other users. So here, if you would be the first person to review a specific dish, you could add it to the system. Then, after clicking on a specific dish, which shows its ratings and number of reviews, it brings you to a page of the reviews of that dish. Here you can read through reviews to give you a better idea of the dish, and also you can write your own review on that dish.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this Android app through Android Studio, using Java and XML files. We used Google Places API for our location tracking as that allowed us to get the specific restaurant that the user is currently at. As for storing the names, dishes, reviews, ratings, and several other fields, we used an SQLite database and hooked that up to our app. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our main challenges involved the parts we weren't very familiar with, which was almost all of it. It took us a while to fully grasp the idea of the way activities work and how to work them together. Also for the Google API, we got stuck figuring out how to use it the way we needed but after a lot of research/testing around with it, we were able to break through.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Each of us on the team had some breakthroughs were were all proud of. One was in using custom array adapter to implement the UI of our activities. Another was the breakthrough with the API and utilizing the different parts to get the specific restaurant location tracking we needed. We also had a member figure out how to have parallel threads running in the app which gave us a lot more capabilities. And finally, the putting together of a database that works directly with our app was something we were proud of.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As this is the first time any of us in the team has actually made an Android application, this entire process was filled with learning. From Android development and all the intricacies behind it to the use of API to building the database, we learned through every step of this process.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Menyu</h2>\n<p>We see Menyu as an app that has actual everyday use. We know like Yelp has something similar where it connects the Yelp reviews which have the dish name in it to the specific dish, but their focus is still on reviewing the restaurant. Menyu, on the other hand, focuses on when you are already in a restaurant and makes it easy/simple to look up dish reviews and leave your own. We've all faced this problem before of not knowing what to order, and we see Menyu as the future to eliminating this problem. Technically wise, there are many features we can continue to add and many things to refine. Things such as UI, account tracking, camera/photo capabilities are all features that could be added in the future. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Nihalum/Menyu.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Nihalum/Menyu.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Color Coded", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>SteelHacksDreamTeam</h1>\n<p>This project is an educational tool for Computer Science, using Arduino and LEDs to demonstrate basic CS control structures for beginners and visual learners.

We were appalled by these high percentages and wished that something could be done to solve this critical problem.  After reflection, we believed that one way we could possibly combat this issue is to make traveling around campus late at night safer for Pitt students.  Thus, Night Owl was created.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Night Owl is essentially a Pebble Watch application that uses motion detection to detect distress and prompts an emergency call for help.  For instance, a student walking home at night will turn on the app on the Pebble Watch at which the point the watch will begin the motion detection.  Should the student feel unsafe, she needs only make a gesture with her arm for a prompt from the watch to call for help.  If the student selects yes, a call will be made to authorities.  The rationale behind using the watch to prompt the phone call is because if the student is threatened by an individual, pulling out the phone may prompt the attacker to take action.  The gesture with the watch is a discreet way for the student to call for help without raising the attacker's suspicion, which we believe to be very vital.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Coding for Night Owl was a two fold process; one that involved the Pebble Watch app development and one that focused on the Android app development to communicate with the Pebble watch.  The Pebble watch component was done with the Pebble SDK and C in the Atom text editor.  The Android app was written in Java.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The major challenge we ran into issues getting the Android app to communicate with the Pebble Watch and programming the Android app to make the phone call.  Also, the Pebble Watch motion detection presented many bugs that was difficult to overcome.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of learning the entire process of programming for for the Pebble Watch as well exposing ourselves to a completely new programming language.  Also, an important accomplishment for us is successfully facilitating communication between two pieces of hardware and transferring data efficiently.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to program in C as well as make applications for the Pebble Watch.  We also gained experience in working with motion detection and Android app development and data transfer between these applications.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Night Owl</h2>\n<p>We hope to continue experimenting with the motion detection capabilities and make the execution process more fluid and intuitive.  We look forward to exploring ways to take Night Owl further.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Pebble watch app development", "I was in charge of sending signals from the Pebble Watch to the Android App as well as building the android app to call an emergency number.", ""]], ["ThereminD", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ThereminD \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/934/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Testing it out!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>ThereminD</h2>\n<p>ThereminD is a brain wave-controlled virtual theremin.
