[["Art Crew", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Art is a universal language. It is a unifying force that transcends social injustices cultural divides, and linguistic barriers, thus becoming the ideal medium through which to harness positive social change, create conversation, and celebrate a collective identity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Through the creation of refugee-designed welcome murals, New Australians celebrates multiculturalism at a time in which refugees within our communities face discrimination, racism, and exclusion. Providing a public arts engagement platform for the youth refugee community fosters a sense of belonging and connectivity to their community and environment.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>HTML, CSS, JS</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We were lucky all of our team members were passionate about art and were committed to making our endeavour a success. We ran into a bit of setback while doing our pilot at Westfield Parramatta. People were not willing to come and talk but we managed to find people willing to express their stories and sit down with our artist to give it a voice.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Art Crew</h2>\n<p>We are undertaking development of huge mural in Parramatta on Australia Day next year. We hope it will be a grand success.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/New-Australians-574102152782989/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/New-Australians-574102152782989/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.facebook.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Covered", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCe7qktkQis?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Covered</h1>\n<h2>Built for Techfugees Hackathon 2016</h2>\n<h5>Meggan Turner, Jack Lo Russo, Sarah Marial, Melanie Thomas, Joumana Domat</h5>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Covered is a platform designed to connect newly arrived Australians to career mentors.

Our family, friends, and community members found it difficult to sign up for services including Banks, Centrelink, Mobile Phone Plans or even find places we needed to go. Accessing information in today's age is becoming easy but accessing the right information in your language in real time is still not a reality till now. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>First Days is a voice application similar to Siri, which is a digital guide, spoken in the person's chosen language and is able to translate, scan documents, direct and connect a person in their language to a range of services, food-bank, aid, financial, employment and housing services. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using Google Translate API associated with API.IA and a OCR api as the core mainframe. \nWe can add any others apis to expand our solution.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some of the challenges we experienced was attempting to narrow down our focus from a mountain of ideas and ambitions. Due to the time constraint, creating First Days from scratch in less than two days means that thorough testing and constant adaptations is very limited.    </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Working effectively and productively in a team, developing a solution that assists refugees, asylum seekers and migrant and better their everyday lives as well as connecting with many like-minded and passionate people from different fields are just some of the many things we are proud of it.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned about the different challenges refugees, asylum seekers and migrants face in Australia and how we can develop technology based solutions for them. We have also learned how to not only create Bello but how to market and pitch First Days to a set of different audiences. </p>\n<h2>What's next for First Days</h2>\n<p>To be launched globally and to be also marketed to tourists visiting different countries. Furthermore, to partner with services that provide assistance to people with limited language skills and to adapt more features as users provide their feedback. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-translate\">google-translate</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/api-ai\">api.ai</a></span></li><li></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://techfugees-saibottrenham.c9users.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://techfugees-saibottrenham.c9users.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>techfugees-saibottrenham.c9users.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18z7cCIwBWAv3xGODe5i9AkTkQoApz-XOYjXvNbsRMBk/edit#slide=id.p6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18z7cCIwBWAv3xGODe5i9AkTkQoApz-XOYjXvNbsRMBk/edit#slide=id.p6\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FirstDaysAU/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/FirstDaysAU/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.facebook.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/saibottrenham2015/firstdaysrepo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/saibottrenham2015/firstdaysrepo\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FirstDaysAU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://twitter.com/FirstDaysAU\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>twitter.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked in collaboration with my team to conduct research for First Days and used my own experience as a former refugee to better the app. I worked as a creative director and assisted Tobias, a dev engineer in building the new app. ", "", "", "", ""]], ["A Fair Go", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Yesterday a few of the young presenters spoke about their challenge in finding work.\nA few of them mentioned their proficiency using and navigating social media.\nAs I'm connected with a large network of small to medium businesses who are starting to experiment with social media, I wanted to create a way for both new Aussies and established businesses to get together.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The platform helps small to medium businesses owners or prospective employers find help fulfilling their social media and web related needs.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created a wire frame, tested it with new Aussies looking for work, changed it according to the feedback from prospective employers...</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We pivoted a number of times throughout the weekend in response to mentor and participant feedback.\nNeither of us were UI experts so we built a wire frame using the resources we had...</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We helped 3 new Aussies create connections / a pathway with prospective employers.
