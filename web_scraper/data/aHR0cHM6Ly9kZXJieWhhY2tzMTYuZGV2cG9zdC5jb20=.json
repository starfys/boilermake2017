One day I was looking into the results for the democratic primary (so far) and began to wonder how the race would shape up in a few weeks. I wanted a quick and simple way to measure public opinion, and I realized that I may be able to do this myself by analyzing twitter data. I'm also deeply interested in natural language processing, so I thought doing this as a personal project would really let me delve into a field in which I'm interested as well as create something that I think is cool and personally would want to use.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mine The Issues is an app that allows users to customize a twitter query through simple text prompts, performs a search using the Streaming API with the custom parameters, and analyzes the data to provide insight into what people are saying about whatever topic the user chooses.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The app was built in python. I utilized several APIs to create this project, including the Tweepy Twitter Streaming library, Yahoo Placefinder to add geolocation functionality to the app, TextBlob and the NLTK to perform data mining, tokenization, and natural language processing on the data set.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of my biggest challenges was that Twitter's Streaming API explicitly prevents filtering by both location and search terms at the same time, which I really wanted my users to be able to do. I was able to hack my way around this by creating custom functions to filter my data by location, something that required the use of Yahoo's PlaceFinder API. Another major problem I had was in optimizing my sentiment analysis algorithm to ensure the most accurate classification of results possible. For this I used several techniques to eliminate \"low information\" features (essentially noise), something that increased the accuracy of my classifier by over 10% to around 93%.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, I learned Python. I had never used Python before this week, so the fact that I was able to complete a pretty major project in this language is really exciting for me. I also learned how to use various APIs including PlaceFinder, Tweepy, TextBlob, etc. What I was most excited to learn however was the natural language processing. Implementing the sentiment analysis tools I used in this program required significant research into the theory of natural language processing (e.g., tokenization, n-grams, co-occurences, information gain, features values, etc...), something I plan to continue in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mine The Issues</h2>\n<p>I want to do several things with Mine The Issues:\n1) Expand it to include more social media services (Facebook, Google+, Instagram, etc...)\n2) Include image mining\n3) Move pieces to the cloud (storage in AWS DynamoDB, querying with AWS ElasticSearch, data visualization with Kibana)\n4) Optimize streaming and sentiment analysis algorithms for accuracy and speed\n5) Create a GUI (plan right now is to use node.js) and make this a fully functional Web Application w/ Mobile to come afterwords</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["derbyhacks-hackathon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>derbyhacks-hackathon</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript\">typescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/domfarolino/derbyhacks-hackathon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/domfarolino/derbyhacks-hackathon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend and teamed up with Ishwar.

This project is designed to improve the lives of these people by making it easier for them to navigate their environments more safely.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The system detects objects in front of person wearing it, as well as drop-offs. It senses the distances of objects and puts gentle pressures on the wearer's arm; the degree of pressure indicates how close they are to an object. A complete release of pressure indicates a drop-off, staircase down, or other ledge, while a heavy pressure would indicate a solid obstacle, such as a wall. It also detects the motion, applying gentle pressure to the upper arm to let the wearer know someone (or something) is moving to their side, or behind them. It is especially good at letting a person know when someone is approaching them from behind.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The SonicStick+ consists of two components, the sonicGlove and the IReye. The sonicGlove consists of an arduino microcontroller connected to an ultrasonic sensor and servo motor, mounted on a glove and auxiliary armband. The companion IReye is made up of a TI launchpad linked to a passive IR sensor and another servo attached to an armband. Andrew sewed custom armbands and modified store-bought gloves to contain the project's electronic components. The servos have foam arms attached to them to apply pressure to the person without being painful.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We originally planned on the IReye being made in two separate parts, where the IR sensor module would be removable. However, our RF chips had horrible documentation, and we were unable to get them to function properly. As a result, the IReye is one integrated system, and the feature was scrapped. It also took a lot of work tweaking the servos to operate as intended.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works, and (we think) it looks cool for the time we had.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>For most of use, this was our first time working with arduinos, so we learned how to code for arduino and wire components to them.

It was inspired by the game Invisible Inc., by Klei. To me, blending of tactical and stealth games was unique and new, and I've yet to see another game like it...the only problem was the AI (also it was a rogue-like, but that's a different story). The AI was so bad, it ruined the game for me, but it inspired me to make a better game some day (which will have a better AI, and be more story driven</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Right now, it let's you move unconstrained, through walls, and at infinite speed. I was focused on getting the guards working (that's the hard part.) so I didn't have time to inhibit the player's movement yet (eventually you will lose the ability to move through walls.)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>sleep 0, caffeine 1. To be honest, a lot of the process is blurry. It was just me, so no distractions, but also no help, or brain storming. But the end result is all mine.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The guards have limited vision, they must both have a direct path to you as well as be looking in your direction. Each guard is looking in the direction they last moved, and has a 90* radius of vision, with unlimited range, but they can't see through walls. Their behavior changes when they spot the player, and I devised a simple scheme of intercommunication between guards which will allow them to spread out and not search the same places over and over for you. That part I never got working unfortunately. I'm also pretty proud of the A* pathfinding alogrith I implemented, which is something I've vaguely heard of but really knew nothing about before hand., Each guards have uniquely and easily programmable behavior patterns which can be made adapt to circumstances. Right now, there's a few different paroling patterns and only one hostile pattern, but more can easily be added.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>never underestimate graphics, they will always be 70% + of the work. I learned about A*, I got practice in a language I don't use much, (I learned that C# is not always very robust, and Java and Eclipse have MUCH better error reporting)</p>\n<h2>What's next for derbyHacks</h2>\n<p>hopefully more people next yeah. It seems like a lot of people who planned to come didn't make it. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bonattt/derbyHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bonattt/derbyHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["The Ultimate Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To challenge the mankind with this ultimate game</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is very challenging</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I don't really remember because of the magnificence of the project but some blood, sweat and coffee was involved</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The game itself</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Surviving the game</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Never to mess with the game</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Ultimate Game</h2>\n<p>It will never stop until it destroys civilization as we know it through addiction</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://haskman.github.io/thegame\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://haskman.github.io/thegame\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>haskman.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]]]
