Fitbit, a device for the wrist, does that for you. But, how about tracking the amount of energy you're expending as well as your carbon footprint? We wanted to create an application that lets you monitor how much carbon you're emitting into the world, and allow you to take this knowledge and work towards reducing your carbon footprint by planting a tree! But, you won't be in this endeavour alone. Just like Fitbit, Treebit allows you to connect, compare and challenge all your friends all in an effort to take action and reduce your carbon emission.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Treebit requires the user to log-in with a Google+ or Facebook account in order to connect the user with their friends. Once on the main page, there are a list of common things that you can click to see how much they contribute to your carbon footprint. The amount of carbon emitted as a result of those actions is shown at the bottom of the screen. Treebit also allows you to see how you are ranked amongst your friends. If you would like to reduce the impact of your carbon footprint and potentially bump yourself up one spot in your ranking, you can buy a tree and prove to your friends that you care about the environment! </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Finding out ways to calculate how some of the things affected your carbon footprint was difficult in our time frame, as there were tons of factors involved in each of them. Given our time limit, we were able to configure the amount of carbon released depending on the distance travelled by a car.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Considering that half of our team had no experience in developing or designing an application, we were able to come up with an idea and bring it to life (almost!). </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Through building Treebit, we learned about the process of making an application using Android Studio, brushed up on our Photoshop skills, and gained a lot of knowledge on how we could reduce our carbon footprint!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Treebit</h2>\n<p>Setting goals and creating daily and weekly challenges with friends are some of the things we hope to include to Treebit, as building a sense of community, while adding some friendly competition is always rewarding! We're also looking forward to adding a progression graph, where users can track their progress and feel motivated or compelled to make a difference! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=EE0D0DB0928E27C4!10737&amp;authkey=!AHQi6TB2iar9L_c&amp;ithint=file%2capk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=EE0D0DB0928E27C4!10737&amp;authkey=!AHQi6TB2iar9L_c&amp;ithint=file%2capk\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>onedrive.live.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["dollarTree", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"dollarTree \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/282/746/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"dollarTree \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/282/747/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyone wants to contribute to the environment,  but it is hard to think of a way where we can actually make a difference. Furthermore, it is seemingly harder for bigger companies to contribute to forest reservatory projects as a part of their corporate social responsibility. What if there was a way for individuals to bridge that gap, that is carrying out the work that huge businesses want by planting trees and getting subsidized products in return.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>You can sign up as an individual or an organization. The intuitive UI makes it really easy to start making contributions. Once plant some trees, your efforts show up on the interactive maps which is shared with all your facebook friends. Moreover, you earn points for every tree planted which can be redeemed by buying products for companies that are promoting a cleaner and greener environment.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were quite a few. Displaying the correct data on the map as soon as people make contributions. Also settings up the reward system took a bit of thinking to layout an effective and engaging method that lures the users to come back and use the app. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was proud to combine the satisfaction of social media promotion with e-commerce which users will look to as a win-win situation while also doing something good for the environment.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Keep the things that are harder to implement at the start. Everything else comes in a flow.</p>\n<h2>What's next for dollarTree</h2>\n<p>The callouts on the map will lead to a detailed view controller revealing the information about that pinned post. This can be used to generate valuable user data to track down users that are most committed in contributing to the environment. Also, another feature would be to show contributions by people all over the world along with your friends to get a more community like feeling.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stripe\">stripe</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">global-forest-watch</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapkit\">mapkit</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/arunrawlani/dollarTree/tree/master\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/arunrawlani/dollarTree/tree/master\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Lead iOS Developer\n"]], ["iBuyGreen", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>This project was realized during the OneTreePlanted Hackathon in Montreal, August 21-23 2015</p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Plant-a-tree", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Plant-a-tree</h1>\n<p>Client app for Onetreeplanted hackathon</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zi-yang-zhang/Plant-a-tree\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zi-yang-zhang/Plant-a-tree\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I work on Android UI such as Gallery, Contributor, Type of Tree etc", "", "", ""]], ["Groot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Groot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/282/759/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>How many pictures are uploaded everyday on Facebook, Instragram and other social network websites ?\nHow many likes does those pictures receive ?
