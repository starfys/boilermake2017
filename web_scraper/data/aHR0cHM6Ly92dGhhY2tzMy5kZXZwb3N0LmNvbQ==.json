This app uses <strong>Capital One's Nessie Hackathon API</strong>, <strong>the Sabre Developer API</strong> and the <strong>Google Places API</strong>. The backend uses a RESTful API built with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> to communicate with a front end implemented in <strong>Angular.js</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We entered the hackathon with the intent of taking on coding challenges offered by sponsors at the event. The Capital One Nessie API stood out to us as an intuitive and straightforward API that would enable us to put our main focus towards building a product that would make the most of the API as well as any other tools we chose to use. We decided on an application to assist in Travel planning because it had a clear use of the API and allowed us to try using other external APIs to assist in the scheduling, pricing and other aspects of developing a travel itinerary for users. We chose to use the Sabre Developer API due to the versatility of search options available for plane tickets and the Google Places API to enable us to pick out locations of interest to assist in planning the overall trip. Our plan was to use the Nessie API to allow customers to build user input centered plans for both their travel expenses and separating out savings into special travel accounts in order to assist in budgetary efforts.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>We faced a number of challenges in our implementation of this project. Our experience with our eventual development tools of choice varied dramatically and a good portion of our time was spent learning how to use Ruby on Rails and Angular as well as trying to learn the three external APIs. We also encountered difficulties with authorization and trying to design our system to function around user logins and passwords. Despite these obstacles however, we were able to complete a fully functional implementation of our initial idea.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>As a team, we were proud of our ability to bring together the front end and back end of our project which we had designed together but built separately. Creating a complete project that interfaced with three different APIs, each with their own idiosyncrasies, was an ambitious task but our success over the course of the weekend was motivating and exciting. It was a fulfilling experience building this system from scratch and seeing it come to life and fulfill our aspirations was inspirational.</p>\n<h2>The Future of Travel One</h2>\n<p>While our project was able to fulfill most of our initially planned features, there remains room for future improvement. Our difficulties with authentication led us to leave out our planned userid/login suite and we were unable to complete all of our desired automatic account management features. We are nonetheless proud of the product that we have completed and are grateful for the opportunity to participate in this event.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/watheuer/vthacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/watheuer/vthacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the frontend of our web app. This was my first time doing any kind of web development and being exposed to HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, and I learned a lot about how web development works.", "I worked on the Rails backend and set up the Angular app which communicates with it.", "I spent long and arduous hours working on the design for the entire site, going through a few design choices and color schemes before settling on something compact and easy to understand.

Using this purchase history, Bag to the Future can automatically remind the customer what to buy the next time they're out shopping. We wanted to accurately model the purchase of items, so we used an exponential distribution for each product to predict the probability of purchase on any given day. Then, we calculate the average time span between purchases of each item and comparing it to how much time has elapsed since the last purchase. The website given below simply models how the reminder system would work over a year. The current day of the year can be seen on the console. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Due to the fact, that Capital One's database was lacking sufficient data to track purchase history, we made our own model of customer transactions and pushed it to Capital One's database. This data was then processed as described above to find trends and then compared against current situations.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The mathematical model to predict whether a customer purchases a given item took the bulk amount time.

Dropbox also did not support uploading of entire directories (including their sub-files/content), so it was necessary to come up with an algorithm to circumvent this problem.\nSetting up a web server also provided its challenges as well.

Foods and meals from our neighbors and our community are not only healthier and more organic, but they taste better as well.  We wanted to build a platform that could change the way we discovered foods and delicacies and bring the community closer together.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Fresh Eats provides a mobile marketplace for users to easily discover nearby healthy and homemade food options.  Users that love to cook can share their traditional family recipes to the world while making extra cash on the side.  Cooks can easily manage the distribution of their foods to their buyers, and buyers </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Ionic and Cordova to build Fresh Eats as a cross platform technology.  Additionally, Stripe technology was used to facilitate online payments.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many challenges associated with adopting a cross-platform approach such as Ionic.  Ionic allows us to easily access the entire market with arguable half the work, but performance issues were problematic at times.  Additionally, we realized that peer-to-peer transactions are more difficult than simple checkout.  Lots of regulations make accomplishing this task much more technologically difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we were successfully able to engineer a solution within 48 hours that could stand in place for a minimum viable product.  Bringing together a project like that is not easy.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Ionic and integration with Firebase.  Through the project, we were able to learn that cross platform technologies served their own challenges.  We also learned a great deal about how we can mesh together the physical world with the online world, and this itself poses its own set of unique hurdles and challenges.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fresh Eats</h2>\n<p>We're going to finish peer-to-peer transactions and take Fresh Eats to the market.  We believe there is a huge demand in the market for homemade and healthy food and this app provides the solution to this problem.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stripe\">stripe</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Hacker Puns", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Puns, often eye-rolling, cringe worthy jokes, are ways to poke fun and explore the different meanings a particular word or expression can have.

Currently FPV(First Person View) drones only have one stationary camera, which the viewer cannot do much with. I decided to make a better First Person experience with the viewer/user, so I this.I had received a Google Cardboard headset and had never used it, so I got a bunch of junk together and made a car like this. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There is an Intel Edison board which is connected to Azure services along with an amazon fire phone. The sensor data(orientation, accelerometer, gyroscope) from the phone is then fed into the Edison via Azure's IoT Suite(we had issues with the fire phone), which in turn steers the car and moves the camera's servos to emulate the user's action. In doing that, the user can control a device many miles away and maintain good communication. I think devices like these can really help in situations where the human body cannot withstand the conditions, and where robot problem solving just cant solve a certain job. It can also help with communication over long distances, such as the ISS or even another planet! Such devices are currently being worked on by NASA, for improving communication with astronauts in outer space.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We got 2 servos and glued them together to a webcam. We then connected the servos and 2 motors to drive the car to the Edison. Once we were finished with that, we decided to have some fun and added some spoilers to the car. One of the motors died, so we spent 4 hours trying to fix it. Thanks to Capital One's Business Card API :) , we improved the overall security and integrity of our robot's structure</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the fire phone to run Android apps, in order to make the device more accessible, was a huge hassle, along with trying to get the Edison to communicate with the phone itself, and to stream the feed directly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Fixing the device many times. The old motors died, so I had to scavenge for parts everywhere. Eventually, I found a motor too big for the car, so I had to modify the gearbox to fit the car and to keep the speed of the sides balanced. We didn't have anything to mount anything on, so I had to improvise, and now thanks to me, a good portion of the robot is held together by business cards given away at the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Do not try to put motors directly to AC Voltage, my friend got a nasty shock this weekend because of it.When in doubt, business cards and hot glue can solve a good number of problems.</p>\n<h2>What's next for VRCar</h2>\n<p>We are planning on adding autonomous Driving, facial recognition, smoothing of images and motion, higher camera quality, faster refresh rates, and an

Having always come to hackathons with my friends to enjoy ourselves we normally try something new or come up with an idea 4 or 8 hours into the hackathon. The trumpfecta's inspiration really stemmed from the fact we had so many technical difficulties with a backend server running googles visual cloud api.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Trumpfecta Project brings you three different ways to experience the Donald.</p>\n<p>WhereIsTrumpGonnaBuildThatWall.com - is a website strictly dedicated to informing people around the country and the world where Trump plans to build a wall. This was done with Domain.com</p>\n<p>TrumpIfy Extension - Replaces every image on a webpage with a lovely photo of Mr.Trump. Its light weight and easy to install and get running!</p>\n<p>Mr.Trumps VR Build a Wall - In this game you play as Donald Trump working to separate a landmass by building a wall. There is even more added realness when using the oculus.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Unreal Engine 4 was used to build the VR experience, this allowed us to have a high framerate yet still beautiful game. The Extension was built in JavaScript and HTML. While the domain was purchased for free through Domain.com</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Microsoft Azure server set up was our biggest obstacle. We were not able to get it to communicate properly with our extension. So the original plan of an extension that grabs images from a webpage and looks for landmarks using googles visual cloud then gets the location data of the user through geolocation. Then it would provide the user with flight plans and destinations where the landmark was located. ATM locations and also Banks will be located close by.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We come to these hackathons not to win but to enjoy ourselves. My friends and I aimed high starting halfway through the night without any knowledge about backend and we were not able to complete it. But we were able to complete 3 separate things all pertaining to a theme.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>To research and come up with an idea in a timely manner or you end up with a bunch of trump themed projects.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TrumpFecta</h2>\n<p>Multiplayer Support for Build a Wall and added wave support.\nTrumpIfy-will receive a wider range of images and resolutions so that a trump can fit in any situation he is faced with.\nThe website- perfect fixing nothing</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unreal-engine\">unreal-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">visual-blueprinting</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">domain.com</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://whereistrumpgonnabuildthatwall.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://whereistrumpgonnabuildthatwall.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>whereistrumpgonnabuildthatwall.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JoeAbunga/FlyAway.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JoeAbunga/FlyAway.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Caruize", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>We used Microsoft Azure for hosting and php and javascript as our main languages to create an efficient carpooling app for students.

Getting each feature accomplished gave me pride and spurred me forward!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>A nice way to approach coding is to hack something out as quickly as possible so you have something tangible to work with. After that, you can play around with it as the code formalises, making it neat and powerful, while giving you something you can test ideas out on without having to wait or create another project. I also learned a tad of regex... uggg.....</p>\n<h2>What's next for Smide</h2>\n<p>Smide has many features planned for it, such as autocomplete that changes its suggestions dynamically based on the keywords that are most used(among other things),  and a profile maker which keeps track of each compiler executable and the syntax highlighting that the user set up for it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dosluke/Smide/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dosluke/Smide/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Cardboard Translator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Imagine you are in a foreign country, and you can't read any of the signs.

This tool, however, forced us to be creative with string parsing as its processing was less strong than the other brands' toolkits. For the majority of us, Android Studio was a new environment that we weren't familiar with, so connecting all SDKs with Android and even just making the app work was a serious challenge. Luckily, with the help of the Capital One staff we were able to make a fully functional, dynamic display off of user-created content.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works. What more can we say?</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Android, Android Studio and Git implementation were just a few of the things we've learned.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CheckMate</h2>\n<p>Improved OCR, higher-end Nessie integration.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gwizdala/CheckMate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gwizdala/CheckMate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of receipt data.", "I worked on the Nessie SDK integration.
