Water consumption, system monitoring, and healthy watering systems to make an efficient system. </p>\n<p>What we did -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built three systems - Solar powered weather Station, plant watering, and water flow.</li>\n<li>C, C++, Arduino - Created firmware for interfacing with barometric, water flow, rain sensors, humidity, heat index, soil moisture and sending the data packets via radio.</li>\n<li>C++ Firmware for receiving radio, parsing the data, packaging into JSON objects and pushing to firebase.\nBootstrap, JavaScript and Node.js on firebase's hosting service to display data and view graphs over time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these systems and many more to come, we hope to apply the reach of computational power to the real world. Eco Node is just one of the many possibilities supported by our affordable mesh network.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"My image\" data-canonical-url=\"https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/all3.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--wAswSTzB--/https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/all3.jpg\"/>\n<img alt=\"My image\" data-canonical-url=\"https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/flow.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--r9ZrEV0k--/https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/flow.jpg\"/>\n<img alt=\"My image\" data-canonical-url=\"https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/water.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--2Ak1QAP5--/https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/water.jpg\"/>\n<img alt=\"My image\" data-canonical-url=\"https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/weather.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--A5hCT2fb--/https://econode.firebaseapp.com/media/weather.jpg\"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/curl\">curl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">radio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://econode.firebaseapp.com/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://econode.firebaseapp.com/about.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>econode.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built weather box node and handled communication between arduino and raspberry pi.

With a leap motion, you can wirelessly control the hand to lift up objects, work in hazardous environments, and many more applications! </p>\n<p>Using the opensource InMoov robot, we were able to 3D print a robotic forearm and hand with a rotational wrist and full control of each digit. For instance, an astronaut in space can easily receive the STL printer files, print out the arm, and with a little bit of labor, have a fully functioning prosthetic. </p>\n<p>By combining the prosthetic with the Leap motion, we were able to get a pretty accurate representation of the hand using the Leap Motion's SDK. With some help from Santa Barbara Hackerspace, we were able to print out parts that broke while assembling the arm. </p>\n<p>The arm, in it's first iteration, had some issues due to the wires used as tendons that we had available at the time. With usage, these cables stretch and require constant maintenance, an issue that can be solved with thicker gauge wires. </p>\n<p>The arm uses a pully system to control each digit, and contains six servos (one for each digit along with one for the wrist). The servos were hooked up to an arduino which communicated via serial to a PC which in turn communicated with the leap motion. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cfj2k5/LeapMotionHand\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cfj2k5/LeapMotionHand\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the code that interpreted sensor data collected from the LeapMotion and translated it to servo controls on the Arduino.

Seeing them in one place, so you can look and nab as much swag as you can! Freeloader is your personal ultimate guide to zero dollar food, fun, and awesomeness.</strong></p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Story Behind The Code</h2>\n<p>Us four team members are all a part of <em>ACM-W</em>, a newly established club at UCLA, specifically made for women in computer science. Through the club, the four of us connected over our common experiences, all of us being challenged through our first or second year of CS classes. Most of us had never been to a hackathon, (Katie went to <em>HackSC</em> earlier this year, so this is her second hackathon) and wanted to build something tangible in the 36 hours.</p>\n<p>At the beginning, we bounced a couple of ideas off of each other. We asked around and tried to see what platform would be both useful to learn as well as allow us to make something at a rather quick pace. Eventually, we settled on web development, as Vivian did have some basic experience in it and it was interesting to all of us. We also had run into each other at Career Fairs before, and one thing all of us as well as most college students enjoy is free stuff. Free is a powerful magnet in the college level student community. </p>\n<p>Building from there, we realized that often times we missed out on opportunities giving out free food and \u201cswag\u201d, especially when a plethora of them are posted on Facebook mostly at one time. We each felt that if there was some way to pick out the free events and view them, it would make it easier for us to actually know about them and allow us to prioritize which ones to go to, combining our level of interest in the material along with the quality of free items being given out. This was where our idea took off. </p>\n<h2>Target Users</h2>\n<p>Our target users are social people who attend many events and occasionally use Facebook to find these events. Active users of social networks are overwhelmed with event notifications from many groups and contacts- so it\u2019s easy for potentially valuable events to slip past our notice- especially when we\u2019re too busy to check Facebook regularly. Freeloader is a simple way for people to efficiently browse through the events that interest them- eliminating the clutter and distractions of Facebook.</p>\n<p>Freeloader is especially useful for finding events that offer free food or swag- common elements at popular events in colleges everywhere. We think that college students, who are busy with their studies, invited to many events, and living on a low budget (looking for free stuff) are the perfect target market for our product.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p>We really liked that our front end design turned out well- our homepage looks professional and well put together. We are also very excited about the fact that we got the Facebook API to work, successfully parsing through the the descriptions of events a user is invited to in order to find those that offer free food and swag, then bringing those events to the user\u2019s attention in an elegant way. Overall, we\u2019re glad that our hack comprises all of the major base features we had planned for it and offers a simple, attractive platform that can already prove useful to users in its current state.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://kaspii.github.io/free-loader/newIndex.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://kaspii.github.io/free-loader/newIndex.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>kaspii.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Housemate", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Housemate \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/944/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Inspiration: \nAfter living with 4 other students in Isla Vista, I found communicating with your housemates quite difficult: ex. making sure that everyone pays the bill, does dishes, and takes out the trash.

We immediately remembered what the Cisco API was supposed to be used for and tried to come up with ways to push the boundaries. We knew that most people would think of using the location history API to analyze the data after the fact and then draw some conclusions from that data. </p>\n<p>That was too boring for us. We never knew that wifi alone could be used to find a client's location. So we wanted to push this new technology to its limits and see how powerful this API can be. Simply getting the data off of the server and running our own data-crunching algorithms on the data would tell us nothing about this technology. We decided that real-time tracking of a large number of clients would be an impressive feat. </p>\n<p>We then set out to make something that would allow us to see the API's real-time tracking capabilities. Then, Virus was born. Virus is a fast-paced game of tag that can be confined within a building or take place all over a college campus. The target user would be primarily college students, since college campuses should have decent wifi coverage.</p>\n<p>Some of our best features include real-time wifi tracking of multiple clients, massive scalability of the game area and number of players, and adaptable design that allows to add more features and even analyze past games. These features depend heavily on the Cisco API, so our game will improve as this technology grows.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cisco\">cisco</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Modern Storytime", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Modern Storytime \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/435/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>OpenGov.com provided an extraordinary wealth of information regarding its client cities - detailed financial and social data on hundreds of cities and countries across the country presented beautifully by OpenGov.

We have seen grassroots campaigns start in our schools and neighborhoods, and we know how much work is required to motivate and promote awareness. We wanted a platform that gives everyone an equal opportunity to share the causes most important to them. We wanted a platform that focuses on knowledge and awareness over money and sponsorship. We wanted a platform that anyone can go on and have a voice that will reach worldwide. So we made rootroot. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>rootroot is a robust, highly available media sharing platform focusing on human-to-human interaction, allowing individuals to promote causes they are passionate about. With a user rating system and crowdsourced categories, it empowers users to spread information easily and intentionally. Users can connect with others over similar interests and discover new campaigns to fight for. All of this is done in real-time, using a powerful, scalable, and modern stack and a seamless user interface. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning new frameworks and technologies is always an exciting challenge, and we all came out with a huge set of new skills. Angularjs was the first front-end web framework for some of us, and Firebase was a major source of headaches. The Heywatch API was a challenge but we were able to utilize it well and are excited to work with it further. With a background in development and not design, UI and UX are not something we have had a lot of practice with, so it was a learning experience in that regard as well. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Working for roughly 48 hours straight, we look back on our weekend with immense pride in our focus, determinism, and productivity. We were able to gain a solid understanding of Angular in a very short amount of time, and found ourselves effortlessly writing new controllers and services that follow good design practice. We are especially proud of our UI design and feel like this is not just a highly functional product, but a very pretty one at that. With no major source control conflicts, we take pride in our development workflow and ability to communicate with one another. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it pays off to focus on one or two major features instead of spreading functionality thinly across many features. We learned how helpful a fast and powerful workflow and task manager is, and how many resources are available for any all and all sources of problems. We learned how important it is not to reinvent the wheel, and to take advantage of frameworks and tools already developed. We learned how satisfying and powerful it is to break large tasks into smaller issues, handling them one at a time in a determined way. We also learned that our bodies are capable of working productively under high-stress settings with little to no sleep, and still have a ton of fun while doing it. </p>\n<h2>What's next for rootroot</h2>\n<p>Sleep. We all deserve a nice, deep sleep after all our hard work. The list of features we want to add are endless, and we are particularly excited about a few. First is having a chat room service based on user-generated environmental categories that brings together people of similar interests and facilitates discussion, awareness, and problem-solving. It will help form community naturally and bring about potential action. We discussed having a platform for live-streaming environmental events and debates, and for facilitating meetups and planning. In an age of digitalization and global communication, we feel like it is more important than ever to have a means for everyone's voice to be heard. \n</p><hr/><p></p>\n<h1>Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Uprooting (Vote for causes you like)</li>\n<li>Tags (Classify and sort causes)</li>\n<li>Compatible with many video encodings (HeyWatch API)</li>\n<li>Convenient previews of causes (HeyWatch API)</li>\n<li>Scalable and Highly Available on AWS infastructure</li>\n<li>Customizable user profiles</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p><hr/><p></p>\n<h1>Images</h1>\n<h3>Login page</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Alt login\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/XLxXmMjl.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--9QColjnG--/http://i.imgur.com/XLxXmMjl.png\"/>\n</p><hr/><p></p>\n<h3>Responsive</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Alt login\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/3r3Wfhr.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--kGaclICi--/http://i.imgur.com/3r3Wfhr.png\"/>\n</p><hr/><p></p>\n<h3>Cause Modal</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Alt login\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/PybgYx6.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--Gqudr9d8--/http://i.imgur.com/PybgYx6.png\"/>\n</p><hr/><p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heywatch-core-video-encoding\">heywatch-core-video-encoding</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heywatch-video-preview\">heywatch-video-preview</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yeoman\">yeoman</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/grunt-js\">grunt.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">composer</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angularfire</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-sqs</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rootroot.firebaseapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rootroot.firebaseapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rootroot.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Comix Nexus", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Comix Nexus \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/731/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I was reading about this old, avant-garde comic called Kabuki that nobody has heard of.

However Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic or Modern periods of music all have their own set of acceptable rules and techniques for arranging those building blocks. A Bach's piece indeed sounds very different than Schoenberg's.\nThis hack tries to alter the compositional boundaries between these periods. We have translated the rules of composition (specifically Schoenberg's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique\" rel=\"nofollow\">12-tone technique</a> has no title attribute.) to code and wrote a program to change the rules of musics of older periods, leaving the building blocks alone.</p>\n<h1>Musical Explaination</h1>\n<p>We basically preserve the rhythm of an older musical piece and then change the pitches according to the rules of Schoenberg's 12-tone Serialism.  We'll quote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-tone_technique\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The basis of the twelve-tone technique is the tone row, an ordered arrangement of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale (the twelve equal tempered pitch classes). There are four postulates or preconditions to the technique which apply to the row (also called a set or series), on which a work or section is based:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The row is a specific ordering of all twelve notes of the chromatic scale (without regard to octave placement).\nNo note is repeated within the row.</li>\n<li>The row may be subjected to interval-preserving transformations -- that is, it may appear in inversion denoted I), retrograde (R), or retrograde-inversion (RI), in addition to its \"original\" or prime form (P).</li>\n<li>The row in any of its four transformations may begin on any degree of the chromatic scale; in other words it may be freely transposed. (Transposition being an interval-preserving transformation, this is technically covered already by 3.) Transpositions are indicated by an integer between 0 and 11 denoting the number of semitones: thus, if the original form of the row is denoted P0, then P1 denotes its transposition upward by one semitone (similarly I1 is an upward transposition of the inverted form, R1 of the retrograde form, and RI1 of the retrograde-inverted form).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>How This Is Implemented</h1>\n<p>We form the basis by choosing a random permutation of twelve notes of the chromatic scale, and then generate a 12-tone matrix based on that row and then fill up pitches of the older music with these rows. Using something like 12-tone matrix automatically relies heavily on interval-preserving transformations. The order of the pitches within a row is pre-determined, but the order of the transformations and rows are not, we'll be choosing them randomly. The beauty of this technique is that the outcome is not a dissonant noise but a valid classical piece!!</p>\n<h1>Computer Stuff</h1>\n<p>We use music21 toolkit to generate 12 tone matrix. We do audiveris for optical music recognition of old musical pieces and musescore to sequence them. The rest of the implementation however, we had to do from scratch!</p>\n<h1>Sample Music Files</h1>\n<p>Notice that the Atonalized versions of Mozart's Turkish March and the Batuque share the same form(!).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jrk1ow1qv08dm46/Rondo_Alla_Turca_Atonalized-0.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atonalized Mozart's Turkish March</a>\nAlso, its normal/tonal version is  <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/u1ju2k6anzrao6e/Normal_Rondo_Alla_Turca_Turkish_March.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/r17hab1p37ziic8/Moonlight_Sonata_3rd_Movement_-_Ludwig_van_Beethoven_Atonalized-0.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atonalized Beethoven's Moonlight SonataMvt3 (Version#1 (Regular Tempo: Presto agitato), Complete)</a> Also its normal/tonal version is <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/71zm6parsfavbe4/Normal_Moonlight_Sonata_3rd_Movement.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/25ooxiionty9mnw/file-0_Atonalized-0.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atonalized Beethoven's Moonlight SonataMvt3 (Version#2 (Slower Tempo: Moderato, different note row than above), First Page)</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/q98dz55cz2ee2p3/batuque_Atonalized-0.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Batuque</a> Also its original/unaltered version which was taken from Arudiveris' library is <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/jxkvp8eo184j3al/batuque_original.mp3?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Sample Sheet Music</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/i7gl4rc8m825a78/Rondo_Alla_Turca_Converted2PDF.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Normal Mozart's Turkish March</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/n2xfpg2yguqhh8w/Rondo_Alla_Turca_Atonalized-0_Converted2PDF.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atonalized Mozart's Turkish March</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Image of Mozart with sunglasses has been taken from <a href=\"http://5aeris.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mozart-sunglasses-carre.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/musescore\">musescore</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">music21</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">audiveris</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aalireza/PySchoenberg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/aalireza/PySchoenberg\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["ELAC Map", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ELAC Map \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/448/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Team members: Owen Wolf, Luis Nava, Pedro Lopez\nContact:</p>\n<p>Owen Wolf: (626) - 627 - 2390\nemail: <a href=\"mailto:owen.wolf@hotmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">owen.wolf@hotmail.com</a>\nPedro Lopez: (323) - 348 - 7164\nemail: <a href=\"mailto:romero1618@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">romero1618@gmail.com</a>\nLuis Nava: (323) - 636 - 7614\nemail: <a href=\"mailto:luis.nava77@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">luis.nava77@gmail.com</a></p>\n<p>Problem:\nWhile google maps has a very detailed outline of the majority of the world\u2019s roadways, it still lacks finer detail in the pathways/alleyways of several major campuses. These maps also lack the alert of blocked pathways during construction, which can be an inconvenience, and areas that should be avoided due to past crime history. </p>\n<p>Solution:\nUsing google maps API, we intended to expand the map of our college campus on google maps to include trails and alleyways and a feature to report crimes and construction to output a convenient path for the user to get from one class to another. The reported crimes will  include the time or reporting, classification of crime, a description subjective to the user, and also whether it was officially reported to the sheriff\u2019s or not, calling the attention of the campus sheriff\u2019s department for closer monitoring of the location and a warning for all other users. To report construction, the starting time and tentative scheduled end time (if any) will be required. The data yielded by these reports will be taken into consideration in the creation of a convenient path for the user. </p>\n<p>Experience Level: \nSB Hacks is not only the first beach-side hackathon, it is also our first hackathon and first time collaborating on a project together.

So when we saw the OpenGov API and the Oculus Rift, it was pretty obvious what we would make.</p>\n<p>What we've done is built a glimpse into the future of big data and virtual reality.</p>\n<p>In 2010 Google CEO Eric Schmidt said \"There was 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days, and the pace is increasing.\" We will need new, innovative ways for the human being to visualize and make sense of such immense data, Data Explorer is definitely one of those tools. </p>\n<p>Our target user is anybody who wants to visualize and make sense of their data differently. It may be their company's data, their physics lab data and in our specific instance, government data. Data Explorer allows users to achieve exactly that goal in an intuitive and futuristic way. </p>\n<p>In the version we built, we pulled financial information from over 150 different cities in the United States, along with those cities' latitudes and longitudes from the OpenGov API, and generated a virtual 3D environment from that information for the user to explore. In the example we built, each city is represented by a tower whose height corresponds to that city's income per capita. One of the features we're very proud of is that the distance between each city is proportional to their real world distances, so that as the user navigates the environment, they are navigating a scaled-down version of the real United States. The user starts in the center of the country and can move north, south, east, and west to the city of their choice and visualize the income per capita.</p>\n<p>Wait, so why is the tagline: Feel your Data. Walking around data make it very personal and open itself up to new insights and epiphanies. In the example environment that we created, these insights will be related to the relative income of neighboring cities. We are hoping that these visualizations will spark new questions like, \"Why is the income so varying in this geographically small area?\" or \"Why is there such a large income disparity in America? \"</p>\n<p>With Data Explorer, you can almost feel your data around you in this surreal experience.

Stackit integrates StackOverflow queries and answers right in your terminal window, and is specifically designed for seamless integration into a software developer's workflow.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Ever since I learned how to use program in terminal, I found my productivity increasing as I could accomplish more tasks just by running commands in bash. I noticed my workflow being disrupted by having to navigate to my browser look up errors or searching up how to do things in StackOverflow and return to my program, hopefully remembering what I had just read, to my terminal. As we brainstormed with whiteboard markers on the windows of the bus from SCU, the prospect of writing a command-line tool that searches StackOverflow was instantly exciting. It streamlines your terminal workflow, transforms a messy copy-past between interfaces into a direct pipe from your error output to StackOverflow's search input, and means that you can access the wealth of knowledge on every programmer's favorite website without ever exiting your terminal.</p>\n<p>Stackit doesn't \"disrupt\" the terminal workflow; we eliminate disruptions.</p>\n<h2>How stackit works</h2>\n<p>StackIt is a cross-platform command line tool that allows you to search StackOverflow by keyword and tag. You can also directly pipe in the error message from code you're debugging to look up solutions for your problem!</p>\n<p>StackIt is built in Python, using the Py-StackExchange API, which allows access to StackOverflow questions and answers, and the Beautiful Soup library, lending the power to retrieve data from StackOverflow. You run the \"stackit\" command with flags and arguments that determine what to search, where to get search input from (keyboard or program error messages), and how to display it.

Designing a way for error messages to be redirected, formatted and input as a StackOverflow search query in the background was a unique challenge, and crafting a smooth and efficient user experience from the command line presented an interesting problem from a design perspective. The display is somewhat limited, and our goal was to make StackIt blend in with other command-line tools our users employ to make their overall development flow as seamless as possible.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This is this team's first first ever publicly distributed (PyPI) Python package. We've already pushed three versions. Creating  a tool for everyone to use is uniquely exciting.</p>\n<p>We've also never made something this useful before; this is a tool we now use, and hope that other people will use too. We love Oculus games as much as the next team, but stackit is something we'll want to keep on developing tomorrow morning. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Bash scripting is not good for cross-platform tools.</li>\n<li>We dig building text-only UIs, but it probably isn't for people who actually like design.</li>\n<li>Onesies retain heat very well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Stackit</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorporation of alternative search algorithms</li>\n<li>Ability to answer questions//upvote from the terminal</li>\n<li>Automatic tagging of environment for query detail</li>\n<li>Stashing searches</li>\n<li>Continuous improvement of StackOverflow display</li>\n<li>SPEED</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/beautiful-soup\">beautiful-soup</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/namecheap\">namecheap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python-package-index\">python-package-index</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stack-exchange\">stack-exchange</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stack-overflow\">stack-overflow</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">skrollr.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://stackitfor.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://stackitfor.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>stackitfor.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["bekind - Random Acts of Kindness", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bekind - Random Acts of Kindness \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/428/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>So many people have stuff lying around in their homes which can be useful to so many others.

(It isn't capable of printing right now though.)</p>\n<p>I wanted to build a small 3D printer from e-waste. CD/DVD drives are very common, but they transverse a very short distance ~1.5in, which is very very small. I recently found a large stepper motor with a large gear from the paper feed mechanism of a printer, so I figured that if I replaced one of the Cartesian axes with a rotating base, I could almost double the volume I could print in, since one drive would be able to print onto a circle of radius ~1.5in: a cylindrical printer.\nOne benefit of building such a small printer was that driving the motors would be simple using H-bridges (and could even be powered directly off the Arduino.) The small amount of parts meant that it would be easy to build my own circuit board as well using vector board.</p>\n<p>I did realize that adding the plastic extruders and filament feeders was very complex (and I was still considering trying to build some of my own,) but building the platform and motion axes was still a difficult task under time constraints.</p>\n<p>In the end I was able to get the \"r\" and \"z\" axes to work, but the large stepper motor I salvaged seems to be broken, moving erratically. I was able to work up some of the rudimentary functions that would be needed to run the printer, like the position tracking and reversing direction, and later I'll hopefully have a good enough understanding of G-code to write a more complete software.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["QRU?", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"QRU? \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/367/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"QRU? \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/368/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"QRU? \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/369/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"QRU? \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/370/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>TEAM QR - Jonathan O., Kelly H., Ky-Cuong H., Jean-Luc C.</h1>\n<h2>QRU - Who Are You?</h2>\n<p>QRU is an Android app designed to take the pain out of swapping contact information with the awesome people you meet.  Picture the scene; you're meeting somebody for the first time, somebody who you want to be able to contact again.  Perhaps it is a player at a pick-up basketball game, a recruiter at a Career Fair, or a friend of a friend.  When the eternal question gets asked, \"What's your number?\" how do you respond.  Are you the type to create a new contact, and have the other person spell out their name and number, for you to manually type in?  Or are you the type to just hand over your phone and hope they're able to create a new contact on your phone correctly?</p>\n<h2>QRWe?</h2>\n<p>We are a team of innovators who want to streamline a process that hasn't evolved as the phone has.  Your phone is already aware of all of your contact information, so why do we spend the time manually entering that information into the phones of people we know?  \"QRU?\" gives users a simple way to share the contact information that they want to quickly and simply.  Input your information once, and let the app generate a QR code that holds your information. Login to Facebook and Twitter as well to let your new contacts easily find you on social media.  When it comes time to swap contacts, just pick the identifiers that you wish to share, and a QR code will be generated that contains all of the information you wish to send.</p>\n<p>You can scan the code of your friend, and all of the information stored in it with initiate change in your phone.  If they included a name and phone number, a contact will be automatically generated and correctly populated.  If they included a social media contact, it will automatically friend/follow the other person.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">qr</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KyCodeHuynh/QRU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/KyCodeHuynh/QRU\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Embedded zxing's barcode reader and QR generator with profile data.

constantly evolving, continuously paving the way for innovators as groundbreaking technology emerges at a rapid pace. We, as Freshmen at UC San Diego, sought to fully explore and appreciate such developments, and chose to create something new, something original, and something that all users can appreciate. Powered by an insatiable curiosity and desire to achieve our maximum potential, we came prepared to the Hackathon with an Oculus Rift and Leap Motion, and worked ceaselessly to create what is now a piece of modern development: Psychic.</p>\n<p>Our team sought to not only provide an enjoyable experience to all in the form of a game, but also inspire awe in the minds of those who had not yet been exposed to the incredible hardware and software we were able to work with. Using Unity, Oculus, and Leap, we made a game capable of truly expanding the bounds of human imagination. Stretch out your hand and manipulate objects with ease, easily reverse gravity on materials around you, or even master physics and fly around the map with a telekinetic grappling hook. Those who have conquered the human mind are truly free.</p>\n<p>We believe that originality stands above all else as a driving motive while working, and so the idea for a game centered around psychic power was born. Though we had experience in Oculus Rift before, it was our first time using the Leap Motion, and we made a strong effort to integrate it with both Oculus and Unity to create a seamless result.  We went through struggles, victories, sleepless nights and productive days, every single moment worth the appreciation we gained from working on a project with friends. This task was not only about creating something incredible, but about learning amazing topics in the process. Each one of us opened ourselves to new fields, obstacles, and ultimate triumphs and now we offer you the same chance through Psychic.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["UniRide", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UniRide \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/331/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Saving the Environment and YOU Money</h1>\n<p>Commuting is a great solution to help the environment around us in endless ways.</p>\n<h1>The Team</h1>\n<p>Our team consists of two San Francisco State University students.

Our algorithm will calculate the best possible match based on times people are leaving and where they live. The UniRide algorithm is designed to be able to match you with a ride everyday of the week, and because SFSU is on a semester system you will have a ride for the whole semester. This application is free to use and will help get a large amount of the cars off the road, saving money for app users and also helping keep the toxic chemicals out of our beautiful bay area.</p>\n<p>Help us lower the amount of cars on the road by making this app a reality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["OcuBongos", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OcuBongos \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/312/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OcuBongos \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/313/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Using the Oculus Rift DK2 and 2 Thalmic Myo's, we created a game to help people learn to play music, specifically the Bongo Drums.

This is invaluable for the app, and is why I believe I am able to apply the stats methods with so much reliability and confidence that what the process returns is actually relevant---because it's based on <em>meaning</em>, not just words.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am really proud of the way the app uses the semantic meaning of the lyrics, rather than just the text itself. I really believe these kinds of systems are important for automated text-analysis...plain stats can only take us so far.\nI am also proud that I got it all working (for the most part) in the short amount time at SB Hacks.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned about some NLP methods I hadn't previously been able to implement, I learned about music streaming, secure authentication, and more about the kinds of apps I enjoy building.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Muse</h2>\n<p>I'd like to be able to release an app based on Muse's algorithms in the future, and that will take some major scalability modifications.

Misfire delivers where Tinder fails, exploiting major flaws in the app: snoop-able conversations, static image content, and, overall lack of encryption. </p>\n<p>And perhaps this is not the only category under which Tinder fails. </p>\n<p>Born as an way for men and women to connect on an equal playing field, any causal Google search for \"Tinder Troll,\" immediately bears results that document the exploits of men as they prank women on the popular matchmaking app.  Interestingly enough, there are extremely few instances of men themselves being pranked over the network. Until now.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>In an attempt to give women a reprieve, we decided to give the men of Tinder what they want most... themselves.</p>\n<p>When two men match with our female Misfire account, the Misfire bot redirects all of the messages it receives from each man to the other--thus engaging the two unwitting men in conversation. The men who take interest in their partner usually discover the deception.  The men whose aim is focused elsewhere tend to misfire.</p>\n<p>The ensuing hilarity is recorded on our website (currently down) for the rest of the internet to enjoy.</p>\n<h2>In the News</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/25/8277743/tinder-hack-bros-swiping-bros\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Verge</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/25/tinder-hack-matches-unaware-straight-men-odd-conversations-ensue/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TechCrunch</a> commented on by the Woz, himself!<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/26/tinder-mismatch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Engadget</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/tinder-hack-to-make-guys-flirt-2015-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business Insider</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/technology-science/technology/crafty-tinder-hack-made-straight-5403790\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mirror</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/brosswipingbros-tinder-hack_n_6948786.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Huffington Post</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/1954733/brosswipingbros-on-tinder-new-hack-caused-hundreds-of-men-to-unwittingly-flirt-with-each-other/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inguisitr</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/tinder-hack-matched-men-men-hacker-says-its-deserved-1860160\" rel=\"nofollow\">International Business Times</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/emaoconnor/i-imagine-a-churro-would-get-messy#.pbRjepyAjr\" rel=\"nofollow\">BuzzFeed</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://uproxx.com/webculture/2015/03/a-tinder-hack-made-a-whole-bunch-of-straight-bros-flirt-with-each-other/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uproxx</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.brobible.com/life/article/brosswipingbros-tinder-hack-catfishing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bro Bible</a> </p>\n<p>Updated March 26, 2015</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xampp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tinder</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.misfire.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.misfire.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.misfire.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front-end, Design", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["", "", ""], ["Judgement Day", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Judgement Day \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/990/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Judgement Day \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/992/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Judgement Day \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/993/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Inspired by the game of Life itself, Judgement Day is a text based simulator that allows you to make a series of choices throughout the game as you progress through random instances of your life.

That's how we came up with the idea of the Shower Saver app. This app has a timer that the user can set, and is accompanied by an image of a cartoon tree that withers according to the length of the desired shower-time. Once the timer is set, the user can choose a playlist of music to listen to, and when it  reaches the last minute of the set shower time, an alarm will go off as a warning. When the desired time is up, the music will stop completely. We are also including a basic statistical analysis of how the user's showering times average out over time, as well a list of some simple ways to conserve water in the shower and elsewhere. Because showering is something that people do daily, many different kinds of people will be able to use this app to monitor their shower-time and help the Earth that we live on (especially California, as it is in a major drought!).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/libgdx\">libgdx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Playlist2000", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Playlist2000 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/962/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>P2K is a voice-controlled music queuing interface.</h2>\n<p>P2K uses Windows Speech Recognition combined with the Vocola voice command language to implement an interface that creates a \"jukebox-like\" media player control system.

Each section includes clickable icons to view current financial data and trends.</p>\n<p>We would like to thank OpenGov for their making this data publicly available and easily parsable in JSON and .csv files.

There is a saddening difference between the quality of food that amateur chefs and culinary all-stars are capable of. Food enthusiasts have been taking steps to mitigate that difference by making fresh produce available via farmer markets and releasing professional recipes online. <em>We want to take it to the next level.</em> There is a problem that transcends kitchens across the globe and we want to provide a solution to it. That problem is <em>temperature control</em>. </p>\n<p>Whether it be baking, searing, grilling, or cooking sous vide, having an understanding of how the temperature will affect the food is paramount. Even more so, being able to control this temperature makes the difference between an amateur meal and a quality meal. </p>\n<p>ThermoCooking is more than just a recipe app. Not only do we inform iOS users on the best cooking practices and have thorough steps on how to create a dish; we make use of thermal imaging technology to make sure that the user is able to cook their food to their desired degree without worrying about under nor overcooking. With this technology, aspiring chefs and food lovers alike will be able to don the chef's hat and bring out the most from the simplest of ingredients.</p>\n<p><strong>This mobile application was created by food lovers for food lovers.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flir\">flir</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["VoicesHeard", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VoicesHeard \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/931/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VoicesHeard \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/932/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VoicesHeard \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/933/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>This app allow citizens to give their say on what their town or city should be spending money on in the next fiscal year. I was inspired by true democracy to create this app. Because we didn't implement a login feature, pretend you are a user who logged and are marked as living in Palo Alto.</p>\n<p>There are two sets of users for this app: town or city government and citizens. Citizens vote on budgets for the next year in their town or city. Citizens cannot vote in other cities. Government officials will look at the suggested aggregate budget by the voting citizen and compare it side by side to the budget of last year.</p>\n<p>I am proud of two cool features : one UI focused and one on the backend. One feature is in the submission you can track your spending based upon how much you've allocate to a given label. If you've spent too much, the spent amount has a border that turns red and you can't submit your suggest government spending. The other feature is on the backend. In my first implementation the aggregate that I calculated was the average of all weights that had the same label. For example if two people asked to spend 20 and 30 dollars on Police, then 25 would render on the graph.  However, that method is not useful to a member of the government. We want to lessen drastic changes by the citizens in how money is distributed into different sectors. </p>\n<p>I made an algorithm that aggregates with a soft margin of how much the value can change from the previous fiscal year. This way, the chart will be much more useful to the paying users of the app, the government.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cleardb\">cleardb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">opengov</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Where's Waldo! ...with a twist ;) ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Where's Waldo! ...with a twist ;)  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/924/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Where's Waldo! ...with a twist ;)  \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/926/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Where's Waldo! ...with a twist ;)  \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/928/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Going to the mall has become so routine nowadays. </p>\n<p>Where's Waldo allows people to play a simple game of Where's Waldo, aided with key pieces of technology that everyone in first world countries have: smartphones.

P1NG is a social experience-sharing application that hopes to be more than any other application on the market without taking itself too seriously. Users can create and customize their avatar, their orbs, and their throws, then share those concerted efforts with anyone using wifi-direct. In other words, P1NG was born to be fun for the programmer and the users.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Alt text\" data-canonical-url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fire3galaxy/P1NG/master/app/src/main/assets/pingImagination.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--3JNdPW8y--/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fire3galaxy/P1NG/master/app/src/main/assets/pingImagination.png\"/></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, launch that ball at your friend's head!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Initially, it started as a humorous idea proposed to my friend when we were considering long-term project ideas, but it always seemed to have potential, mainly because it can be reinvented into many different interpretations. One could use thermal imaging to add special effects to throws or location apis to consider what a campus would do to the trajectory of a random toss. The drone could even be a special \"live\" throw that targets the recipient through location tracking in nearby areas. The target user for this application is anyone who can appreciate simple humor and silly innovation which, along with the graphics, skews the target age range towards the younger audience. </p>\n<p>I am most proud of the application's ability to track finger touches and send similar data to other androids. It was a hectic and wonderful experience and, as this application's function is simple, it can be innovated through the use of other apis to do things unimaginable, just as the basic features of the application were once thought unimaginable. It was difficult work, but worth the patience, and official release should be a possibility in the coming Sunday. Until the next release.

The GameEngine should contain the core logic of the game, while the GameInterface should handle user interaction. Both elements use the GameManager to communicate between one another.</p>\n<p>A GameManager will generally use some sort of networking to communicate to remote GameInterfaces, though one could also be implemented to coordinate a pass-and-play game on one device.</p>\n<p>While I plan to write more built-in GameManagers, so far the only one is SocketManager, which uses Web Sockets to handle events. <code>server.dart</code> provides a simple implementation of a server compatible with SocketManager. A single server can simultaneously support multiple games.</p>\n<p>While the GameEngine and GameInterface should be written in tandem for each game, GameManagers are completely separate. The existing SocketManager should work for any game that wishes to use Web Sockets and the same games included in this repository should work with any properly written GameManager.</p>\n<p>In order to demonstrate the library, I developed two samples during the hackathon: <a href=\"http://jackthakar.com/gm/guess\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guess the Number</a>, a simple game for any number of players where you try to guess a number between 1 and 100, and <a href=\"http://jackthakar.com/gm/silicon\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hackers of Silicon</a>, a somewhat simplified clone of Settlers of Catan for 3 or 4 players (plus an additional device to display the board).</p>\n<p>The Dart code of both the library and the samples is available on <a href=\"https://github.com/jathak/GM.dart\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a>. JS-compiled versions of the samples are linked above and should work on any browser that supports Web Sockets (the latest versions of all five major browsers do). You're welcome to play around with it, but the library definitely needs some polishing before it's ready for production. Once I clean it up, document it (and probably add a few more features), I'll upload it to Pub (Dart's package manager) so it can easily be included in projects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dart</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">web-sockets</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jathak/GM.dart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jathak/GM.dart\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["hivepoll.me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"hivepoll.me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/209/072/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"hivepoll.me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/209/074/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"hivepoll.me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/209/076/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"hivepoll.me \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/209/078/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"hivepoll.me \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/209/080/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"hivepoll.me \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/209/082/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Target user</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Teachers</li>\n<li>Public speakers</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Features</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>No Sign-up required</li>\n<li>Get Real-time feedback from your audience</li>\n</ul>\n<p>hivepoll.me is a web application that lets you get live presentation feedback to connect with your audience.</p>\n<p>When you need to communicate to a group of people, building a connection is vital to improve that communication. In a typical setting, if you need to ask a group a question, it\u2019s tough to get an accurate analysis of what people answer in a timely matter. We\u2019ve decided to make a solution.</p>\n<p>Hivepoll.me allows people to create questions on any device that\u2019s connected to the web. Once a group of questions is made, Hivepoll generates three unique view links: the presenter, view, the audience view, and the display view.</p>\n<p>The presenter view gives the question-creator a display of all the questions they made in the session. They are then able to push these questions for the audience to see and answer.</p>\n<p>The audience view can be accessed by an infinite amount of people who then wait for the presenter to ask questions. No more having to go to different links for questions or having to buy expensive devices!</p>\n<p>Finally, the display view shows the current questions with the amount of votes the given question received. This view is updated in real time so everyone can see the votes as people cast them.</p>\n<p>All of this makes for an intuitive experience that saves presenter\u2019s time and allows the audience to communicate quickly and accurately.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jsambuo/hivepoll.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/jsambuo/hivepoll.me</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yeoman\">yeoman</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bower\">bower</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/grunt-js\">grunt.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">atom</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hivepoll.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hivepoll.me/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hivepoll.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jsambuo/hivepoll.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jsambuo/hivepoll.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend", "Front-end development"]], ["Heat Sick", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Heat Sick \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/024/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Heat Sick \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/206/890/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Heat Sick \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/207/025/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>This app allows the user to use infrared cameras to track their personal average body temperature.
