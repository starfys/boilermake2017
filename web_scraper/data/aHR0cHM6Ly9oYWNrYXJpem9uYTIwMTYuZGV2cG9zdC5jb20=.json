They are one of the world's fastest growing industries, with enterprises around the world exploring their widespread deployment. The difficulty, however, lies in efficiently managing them without unnecessary loitering and wasted time.</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>Drone Flight Area Control, or DFAC for short, maintains a list of drones and tasks, and sends drones out to those tasks in the most efficient order. The drones and tasks can be monitored and managed through the DFAC web interface, which allows the user to visualize the layout of the tasks, keep track of the drones and their current tasks, and add, modify, and remove tasks. The interactions with the DFAC backend, however, are limitless. Data is exchanged via HTTP GET and JSON, so there are many innovative possibilities for managing the drones and tasks. This also means DFAC can be used as a scheduling and control backend to existing applications.</p>\n<h2>Who Did What</h2>\n<p>The DFAC backend and interface was developed by Mark Omo, and the DFAC web interface was developed by James Rowley.</p>\n<h2>How I Built It</h2>\n<p>Mark:\nThe DFAC backend is a multi-tiered, multi-threaded, socket driven system, which allows it to be infinitely extensible and scalable to hundreds of task regions and hundreds of thousands of drones. The backend is entirely python based, leveraging existing resources, and enabling quick additions and modifications. Adding new types or classes of UAVs is very easy, and seamless integration into the current tasking system allows them to execute tasks tailored to their strengths.</p>\n<p>James:\nThe DFAC web interface is a fully client-side webapp which can be either served as a static webpage or run from disk. It utilizes the basics web technologies, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as jQuery and the Google Maps API. jQuery is used for interaction with the DFAC backend as well as various simplifications, and the Google Maps API is used for displaying the map, the tasks and the drones, as well as for selecting a location for a new task. The interface is also scalable, and usable on mobile devices.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I Ran Into</h2>\n<p>Mark:\nEnsuring the application was thread safe and did not require cross thread variables was a challenge, along with ensuring the whole system meshed together and could meet the load demands of many vehicles at the same time.</p>\n<p>James:\nI have never written a real-time webapp before, so getting the data to update and synchronize with the server in a timely manner was a challenge. Additionally, getting the CSS to cooperate and not send entire sections off the page while still being scalable and extensible was tough at times.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of</h2>\n<p>Mark:\nGetting the system working in the short time we were allotted was the biggest achievement in my eyes, along with keeping the server thread safe, and eliminating the possibility of the threads tripping on one another.</p>\n<p>James:\nI'm definitely proud of getting the whole thing to run smoothly and interact with the DFAC backend, while being able to handle hundreds of tasks and drones scalably. Also I'm pretty happy with the overall look and feel, as well as the drone and marker graphics.</p>\n<h2>What I Learned</h2>\n<p>Mark:\nI learned the importance of writing agreeable system interface documents. James and I went back and forth several times on the structure and terminology used in the application interface, using only text chat to boot, so getting the interface right was a learning experience.</p>\n<p>James:\nThis was my first time working with jQuery, which I was a bit reluctant to pick up, but I've seen the light and learned quite a bit about what seems to be one of the most prominent web frameworks. I also picked up a bit of python from modifying the dummy server, so that's nice.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for Drone Flight Area Control</h2>\n<p>In the future, we want to build in specific applications to assist with task creation, including automatic response to traffic congestion, traffic accidents, and emergencies, automatic industrial and commercial inspection (i.e. inspecting a skyscraper or pipeline), and features targeted for search and rescue applications. In terms of specific features, we want to add result collection and presentation for tasks, a log of previous tasks and drone actions, alerts for completed tasks and drone problems, and task prioritization. For the frontend, we want to add paths/trails for the drone as well as heading of the drone.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mavlink</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">drone</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">uav</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DroneFlightAreaControl\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/DroneFlightAreaControl\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote the frontend", "Wrote the backend"]], ["Oculus Rift Controlled Laser Turret", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Oculus Rift Controlled Laser Turret \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/964/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our laser system, controller units and Oculus Rift.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Oculus Rift Controlled Laser Turret \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/993/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Closeup</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A few months ago a few of us came across a 15 Watt laser that we wanted to mount on a gimbal. Realizing the scale of that was impractical and unsafe for a first build, we decided to scale this down.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The aim of this unit is to allow the end user to control a laser that can rotate about an axis and can change its pitch. An Oculus Rift allows the end user to control the drone with his or her head. A dedicated fire button controls the laser.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a variety of manufacturing methods to build hardware unit. The base of our drone MDF (medium density fiber) board. It provides a very sturdy base for our turret. The lower part of our turret is a 3D printed custom designed base. It contains a racetrack ridge that we will detail in a bit. We used PLA for this part as it was readily available. Additive manufacturing allowed is to incorporate a racetrack on board, on which we have several marbles acting as ball bearings. On top of these marbles rests the upper part of our turret. Containing a another race track, and connected to a motor shaft in the center, this part is free to rotate. The ball bearings allow for reduced friction here. On top of turret sits another motor to which an armature is connected. On which rests our 10 miliWatt laser. The armature is free to move in the vertical axis allowing for our second degree of freedom. Lastly on top of the laser holding mechanism, rests a webcam. This provides a direct feed to our user.</p>\n<p>On the electronics side, we use a raspberry pi as our turret controller. This is also connected to a motor controller shield powering two NEMA 17 motors. Additionally, a relay controls power to a laser while a button allows for a software trigger of the laser. The oculus control computer is a mac. It is connected the webcam and Oculus Rift. The rift provides a head mounted display as well as an inertial measurement unit to provide orientation information. The mac and pi are connected via CAT 5 ethernet.</p>\n<p>The software on the pi is a heavily modified version of Adafruits motor controller example code written in. The oculus controller is a C++ code base, based on Occulus in Action. The systems are connected by a UDP packet linked.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Accidental corruption of raspberry pi file system - Fixed by using a recovery software to rescue code before formatting the drive.</li>\n<li>3D printer misalignment issue - During the print of the upper turret piece the printer was off by 3 millimeters. This eliminated some symmetrical aspects of our design. Solved with liberal use of a mini Dremel. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Controlling a laser</li>\n<li>Working with a interdisciplinary team of an engineering project.

A binder with hand-written logging of package and student related information on sheets of paper sit at the mailing desk. Residents discover that they have packages ready for them at the desk when they see yellow package description slips in their mailboxes (slips of information that are filled out by hand, also by desk assistants).</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Our vision is of a more automated and fully digitized system for distributing packages. Desk assistants use our developed mobile application that includes use of open source text recognition software to scan packages. This information is immediately logged into our postgresql database supported by a django server with an angular-material frontend interface for digital management of the database through a table view with export CSV functionality for keeping track of information and add/remove operations, used when necessary.</p>\n<p>The django server is able to interface with the database as well as other applications. Cross-references to student information as well as error checking is handled in the server. Given scanned package information (address block) and referencing student information, all the information related to the mailing packages is known, and the server interfaces with Amazon EC2 queuing services and is tasked with using Cisco Tropo APIs to send SMS notifications to  the owners of the packages received by the organization.</p>\n<p>Overall, this designed system would allow for enhanced mailing package management, that within seconds, is able to log and determine package information and send SMS/Email notification to receivers, thus bypassing hand-written methods of logging mail and manual notification systems.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spenlee/mlp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spenlee/mlp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spenlee/ocr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spenlee/ocr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spenlee/backend_scripts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spenlee/backend_scripts\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked purely on the backend ", "", ""]], ["Tucson Flux", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tucson Flux \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/178/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Overview of patterns in north Tucson</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tucson Flux \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/209/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Zooming in on evening downtown traffic</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tucson Flux \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/374/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>How effective is our similarity measurement?

We layout the drivers and their routes over the city of Tucson and filter based on time and location. Second, an inter-user <em>similarity</em> view. This view shows the most closely related groups of users via an undirected graph. This view also allows filtering of the spatio-temporal view, helping answer questions about how similar users behave, as well as offering an evaluation of a given similarity measure by verification against the semantic similarity of the users paths. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>A series of scripts take the raw, large GPS data from the Metropia data set and produce a smaller, cleaner version suitable for the web. We drop points that don't add much to the visualization -- We can get away with a few points for a 10-mile straight journey on the highway, but a meandering trip around the neighborhood requires more fidelity.</p>\n<p>Next, we ship the data onto a web client.

If majority of the tweets were found to be depressing, the probability of the individual suffering from a mental condition would be high.

One such population is elderly people who desire an independent lifestyle, but are more vulnerable to medical emergencies. Andrew\u2019s observations of his grandma led him to think of what other uses a cane might have. He recognized that a cane is an instrument for mobility and stability, but when it fails the results can be catastrophic. When someone falls without the ability to help themselves back up, it could be weeks or months before they are discovered, so having a network of communication is vital to their safety. Conventionally, people with such disabilities would have to rely on a caretaker, but this can be a costly undertaking and a botherance to both parties. Our cane will allow the user to have a sense of security while still maintaining independence.## What it does</p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>This cane detects a user\u2019s fall and texts help with increasing urgency based on ensuing movement and input. \n-The accelerometer detects if the cane is within 30 degrees to parallel to the ground and sends a text to a specified caretaker with the message \u201cYour loved one may have fallen. Please check in with them.\u201d\n-If the user gets up or presses the button with the query \u201cAre you ok?\u201d, the alert is turned off.\n-If 15 seconds go by without those indications of well-being, a second text is sent with the message \u201cYour loved one is not getting up.\u201d\n-The walking stick has a power button so the alert function can be turned off and on if desired. A LED indicates when the cane is on.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Arduino Wire Library to facilitate communication between the Arduino Leonardo and the accelerometer module. This involved reading the module\u2019s datasheet, learning about I2C connections, and looking at the source code for the Wire Library\u2019s functions on GitHub.

Ranging from education to major social issues, we use VR to address what we believe needs the most change. Virtual Reality is a technology that can express thoughts, emotions, and experiences, and can therefore convey themes like no other medium truly can. Therefore, when talking about a subject that one must truly experience to understand, depression quickly came to mind.</p>\n<p>Depression is a powerful force that, most often, can only be understood from the inside. It's hard for others to differentiate between real depression and sadness. We wanted to create a VR experience that would allow those who haven't been through depression begin to understand how serious of an illness it really is. </p>\n<h2>Research</h2>\n<p>A huge part of our project was actually researching depression. This was also the most impactful and eye-opening part of the entire hackathon. We all headed to online forums, social media sites, and chat rooms, trying to gather data through a prepared google form we wanted to spread to people who had experienced depression. The result was more than we could have ever asked for. By the time of our submission, nearly thirty individuals had anonymously shared their stories, backgrounds, and views with us. Each entry held a great deal of emotion, and without this research, we could have never understood what depressed people really feel. Each response was rewarding, but at the same time very somber as we read through personal accounts of depression.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Another Day places you, the user, inside a bedroom that is initially filled with light. The first task in the game is simply to close the blinds and stop the blinding sunlight from entering. In the game, this sunlight is symbolically radiant and shining throughout the whole room. This is only the first step in helping our users understand depression.</p>\n<p>The experience, as is, mainly involves looking around your bedroom and investigating items. Although many of these objects are completely ordinary, it's the unique thoughts that accompany each interaction that marks the signs of depression. We sought to focus heavily on feelings of apathy and reflection, noting how you- the protagonist- slowly descended into a state of demotivation and lack of care for the world. These thoughts literally appear on the screen, and each discovery gives even further insight.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of the room experience, we take a more direct approach to the issue by quoting the anonymous survey responders and explaining the hardest parts of depression. We also, however, believe that any project focused on depression needs a glimmer of hope. After carefully reading each interview, we selected quotes that focused on recovery, hope, and advice to others with depression. We put those together into an ending moment for the Virtual Reality experience, that seeks to empower a user to reach out and show compassion toward those with depression. It's everyone's responsibility.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Another Day using the Unity Game Engine and the Samsung Gear VR. All scripts were coded in C#, and the application was tested on a Samsung Galaxy S6. Some of our 3D Models in the experience were created using Maya. We further used Google Forms to send out our surveys.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Depression is a deep, powerful, and complex feeling that is incredibly hard to grasp without direct experience with it. We had to approach this problem cautiously, because if we weren't careful, we could entirely misrepresent the real problem at hand. We had to help others understand depression, but if we didn't understand ourselves, we would become enemies of our own cause. As a result, and because we wanted to be thorough, we chose to spend a majority of our time spreading an online survey to depression forums and other forums of social media. We lost a lot of time, but it was worth it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p><strong>Depression:</strong>\nOur entire team learned much more than we ever thought we would. We discovered the ugly truths about depression, the scary realities, and then attempted to make that into an actual experience. It was a morose situation, and we achieved our work with a heavy heart. However, in the end, we grew as individuals and allied ourselves to a cause that was previously unknown. Regardless of the project quality, we learned a great deal about depression, and therefore achieved our ultimate goal in at least a small sense.</p>\n<p><strong>Gear VR:</strong>\nThough we often develop with Virtual Reality, this was our first time developing with the Gear VR, Samsung's mobile solution to Virtual Reality. In turn, it was our first time building for Android on Unity, and we found that there were quite a few tricks we encountered. However, in the end, we were able to overcome the new hardware and create a worthwhile experience.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Honestly, what we learned from this project was far less about technical skill and far more about the severity of depression. The more we dedicated to our work, the more we became invested in the cause we're trying to support. We read first-hand accounts of depressed individuals, walked through their lives, tried to understand their minds. We had to put ourselves in that place, and then ask how we can show what we learned to others. We grew humbled by our research and our project, and gained a valuable lesson that few other subjects can provide.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Another Day</h2>\n<p>This is a project we want to grow. Depression cannot just be represented in a five minute demo, and certainly not in a project that was thrown together rapidly in 36 hours. It's a massive subject that requires care, and we want to continue to perfect it. We want it to be something that can accurately capture a depressed mind. Through more research, actual tests with our target audience, and refined themes, we believe that Another Day can become a sobering educational and relatable experience for everyone.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/samsung-gear-vr\">samsung-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maya\">maya</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">virtual-reality</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">audacity</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/anikan/Another-Day\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/anikan/Another-Day\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did all the writing for the experience, helped add speech bubbles to different objects, collected survey feedback, and created the entire ending sequence.", "I made a door!!", "I made the thought bubbles!\nOh I guess also making it compatible with Gear VR."]], ["Wolfram Wikipedia-Game Solver", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wolfram Wikipedia-Game Solver \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/768/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Wolfram-Wikipedia-Solver</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wolfram Wikipedia-Game Solver \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/703/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Wolfram-Wikipedia-Solver</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wolfram Wikipedia-Game Solver \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/678/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample Results</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration]</h2>\n<p>We wanted to challenge ourselves and dive into the Wolfram language!

a hack that bridged each of our specialties (optical sciences, biomedical engineering, and computer science) in addition to the recent Ebola outbreak and epidemics in general, the X-Terminator Drone was born. This hack aims to reduce the risk of healthcare workers and volunteers in the face of an epidemic by using drones to UV sterilize the field. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The X-Terminator Drone uses UV light that is reflected off of sputter-coated aluminum propeller blades to inactivate viruses (by irreversibly damaging its genetic material), making them no longer deadly and unable to replicate. The ultimate application of this hack is for healthcare facilities and patient clinics to be sterilized of harmful pathogenic diseases without need for human contact with deadly viruses and pathogens. High-risk areas can be first sanitized by a drone prior to human contact.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>To automate the Parrot AR Drone 2.0 Elite, an Arduino Uno connected to multiple ultrasonic distance sensors was connected to the drone. Each propeller blade was sputter-coated with aluminum metal (~50nm thick) to reflect UV light. A UV light source was mounted under each propeller blade at an ideal distance from the blade to best reflect the UV light below the drone (the physics is explained on our website). Finally, the drone itself was programmed to autonomously roam a room via feedback from its distance sensors mounted in each direction, at an altitude permitting UV inactivation of viruses and pathogens. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was a very technical hack that involved many endless hours of troubleshooting, especially since none of us had done many of the technical hardware and software hacks involved. We were new to the Arduino and drones, as well as how to build the circuits we needed. This hack first involved identifying multiple UV light sources, of which we went through a couple LED light options before our final solution. Along the way, we encountered faulty hardware, and our procedure of soldering and connecting our initial ideal higher-powered UV LED lights resulted in their electrical failure. We then had to improvise and go with another set of different LED lights that were in the UV spectrum. Next, there is little documentation of hacking a Parrot Drone with an Arduino that combines all of the endpoints we included in our hack. </p>\n<p>Beginning with wiring the circuitry on breadboards to connect multiple distance sensors to the Arduino, we encountered issues with the readout and responses that we had to troubleshoot. Part of the issues were related to the voltage, and we eventually figured this out. Next, there were differences in Drone pinouts than what was posted online, we had to identify through voltage drops and differences the functions of the pinouts, and then connect the drone to the Arduino. For many hours, we were only able to connect successfully the computer to the Arduino and receive proper printouts from the sensors, and not from the Arduino to the drone. To solve this issue, we had to seek some advice on matching the voltages between our various types of hardware in order for all of our code, hardware and sensors to communicate. Based off of the advice and feedback we received, and online forums, we put together a level converter to divide voltage that allowed communication between the sensors, drone, and Arduino to finally happen (BUT, not before we faced a malfunctioning Arduino, and after using a fresh one we figured out that this had been the problem for a couple hours). </p>\n<p>Next, we had to weigh all the components and shave off any excess weight-- considering a second voltage divider to draw less energy. After that, we had to figure out the actual hardware and mechanical mounting of the LED lights. The next challenge was consolidating all of our multiple circuits into one small and lightweight board. Then finally, we wanted to command the flight of the drone to be similar to an iRoomba vacuum. We wrote javascript to automate the this type of room sweep via drone flight movements. This was one of the toughest hacks, as it was not clear in any instructional references we could find how to actually control the drone via the Arduino while using the sensors. We spent at least a full 16 hours on trying to get the communications between the devices working. Finally, we succeeded in reflecting UV light off our of drone propellers at the end, which allowed us to consider our hack a proof-of-concept for use during an epidemic. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>The amazing collaborative teamwork and the fact my team worked together non-stop to make this happen! What an incredible effort, especially given that none of us have done much of the things we had to figure out for this hackathon. We each learned how to integrate and utilize new hardware, software components and languages, and had to draw from past science classes as far back as high school for the scientific concepts.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Many many things, already alluded to in the challenges section... mostly along the lines of working with new hardware, circuits, writing Arduino code, working with Arduino libraries, interfacing multiple technologies, hacking a drone, new/unfamiliar coding languages, etc. </p>\n<h2>What's next for X-Terminator Drone</h2>\n<p>Trying to find the support to turn this drone into a reality where it can be utilized out in the field. What would be ideal is to use holograms on the propeller blades, instead of aluminum, and to use a high-powered UV laser. The future drone will also come with a companion rover that is a land-based robot that can manipulate obstacles and objects in the environment to deal with unfamiliar terrain and situations.</p>\n<p>Important video links that should be viewed to show we've done technically!

"]], ["Dronely Kubrick", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Coming into the Hackathon, as shocking as it may seem, 2 of our 3 team members had never written a real line of code in my entire life. I, along with my friend Rob, were persuaded into taking part in the Hackathon by our roommate and good friend Omri, who happens to be a CS major, without much of a real understanding of what we were getting ourselves into. While sitting at the opening ceremonies, feeling like we wer left out of some inside joke that everybody else in the room was a part of, we became determined to quickly come up with an idea that, with Omri's knowledge and help, we could somehow manifest in 36 hours, and that our prior knowledge would serve to help us succesfully build. </p>\n<p>Being a Creative Writing major who's taken several film courses, and knowing that we would have access to drones with cameras on them, I came up with an idea that I thought might be worth trying to pull off. Having learned a bit about cinematography in those classes, and having actually tried to film some shorts myself at one point in time, I was well aware that to make a truly professional looking video, one needs access either to a Director of Photography (which costs a lot of money), or to a ton of extremely nice equipment (which costs even more money, and also requires some serious, serious skill). Enter Dronely (pronounced Drone-lee) Kubrick. Inspired by Stanley Kubrick, arguably the most visionary director of all time, we aimed to create a UI that leverages the programmable capabilities of an HD filming drone, strung together by some lines of code, to deliver nearly any filmmaker, with nearly any budget, access to expert camera angles and shots at the touch of a few buttons.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Built using HTML5 and CSS, the user interface for DK is a clean platform on which filmmakers can select one of four of the most frequently-used shots in film. The filmmaker simply has to connect to the drone's wifi network, and click on the preferred shot, and voila! Being built in 36 hours by a group that had 2 members who had to utilize over half of the time to simply learn the basic building blocks of coding and programming, the interface naturally does not accomplish everything that we one day envision it doing. It is, however, a very promising start to what we feel represents a big step forward in filmmaking. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I personally built the site on HTML5 and CSS using the bootstrap Jumbotron template, while my teammates tackled the problems of getting the drone's live stream to connect to a server that we could host the site on, and programming the drone to be able to shoot the director's selected shots in an automated fashion (and then program that code into buttons on our UI). In the end, we created a user-friendly, aesthetically appealing interface with scaled functionality that we feel is a highly promising proof of concept for DK. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Aside from not really knowing how to do anything necessary to complete the project at the start of the weekend, the idea itself had some pretty major roadblocks, that (per my roommate, and some of the hackathon's mentors) would've been challenging for even the most talented of hackers. Namely, getting the drone to broadcast live on the same server as our website, programming the website's button's to command the drone, and getting the UI to run on the drone's wifi gave our team some big headaches. A lot was overcome through trial by fire, and a lot of stack overflow. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Honestly, I think that we put together a really great first effort at what we all believe could be truly disruptive and revolutionary idea. I am most proud of the way we managed to each truly contribute a piece to the project that itlegitimately would not have been nearly as complete without. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>HOW TO CODE. Kind of. I was reminded more than enough times through the weekend that HTML and CSS aren't 'real coding.' In any case, whatever they are, I learned a lot of it. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Dronely Kubrick</h2>\n<p>We hope to continue to develop the interface until we reach a level that we are 100% satisfied with, so that we can eventually get some filmmakers on the scene to try out the product. From there, our hope is to continue to add functionality, whether that be in the form of more shots, better quality, longer duration, or multiple drones filming at once being controlled on the same interface. Seeing how much we accomplished with the odds stacked against us this weekend has absolutely given us the affirmation that we need to make sure we keep this project going, and see it out until the final cut to black.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/youtube\">youtube</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/omrihq/HackAZ16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/omrihq/HackAZ16\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Joystick Keyboard", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Joystick Keyboard \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/968/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our fancy hardware</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Small screens make it inconvenient to use a keyboard, so we developed a new way to write text using a joystick.

Based on this idea, and the fact that the hackathon committee was borrowing some myo armband devices, we created a Java application utilizing some open source on GitHub to control a Spark fun robot. </p>\n<p>Note: The open source utilized was from NicholasAsuart and it consisted on Java binding of the Myo Armband. <a href=\"https://github.com/NicholasAStuart/myo-java.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/NicholasAStuart/myo-java.git</a></p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>The robot was programmed using a PIC24F microcontroller. The microcontroller controlled the amount of voltage that went through the two little motors of the vehicle aided by an H-bridge. The microcontroller was also connected through a Bluetooth module to the computer. IT is important to emphasize the robot was build by us but prior the competition.</p>\n<p>The main goal of the project was to send commands and/or instructions to a spark-fun robot without any joystick, or phone input. Instead, we design the application taking the advantage that Myo send data from muscle contractions to the computer easily. We then were able to analyze the data utilizing eclipse and Java and send the information bya serial communication to the Small robot. </p>\n<h2>Our learning</h2>\n<p>We discovered that being at a hackathon is nothing like being at a competition. It is the greatest place to learn, share, and build ideas with students around different campuses. We also learned that a team does not have to have all the resources to build something. In fact, what it really required is to have positive attitude and open mind, only then You can make stuff that you previously thought it was impossible to do. </p>\n<h2>What's next for HthonMPortControl</h2>\n<p>There is still much to do with HthonMPortControl. First, make it so you can control the speed of the spark fun robot. Secondly, create a GUI to display the gesture the user is doing utilizing the Myo device and action the vehicles takes after the gesture. Finally, we should add proximity sensors to the robot to prevent young padawans from crashing the vehicle robot.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AJAngel713/HthonMPortContro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AJAngel713/HthonMPortContro\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Data Visualisation", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Data Visualisation \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/782/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Traffic Flow</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Data Visualisation \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/790/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Heatmap</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Data Visualisation \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/943/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pima County SVG</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Data has become extremely important.

As of now, the best AAC 'device' that people who communicate like this have is the idea of folding a piece of paper in half and writing the gesture on one half and the translation on the other side. We, Beginner's Luck, decided that we could do better. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project uses Myo Armband, an integrated sensing device that has EMG, accelerometer, gyroscopic, and orientation data to record a gesture, and then store it with a translation as far as what this gesture means to the individual who performed it. When this gesture is then performed while in the translate mode, the application will translate their gestures for other individuals in their environment to be able to more easily communicate with these individuals.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built an iOS application and used the Myo SDK to use the raw data to record a gesture. Then we sent this data through a database to store it as a gesture that can be translated.

We want to provide a solution to this problem by getting some amount of aid to the scene quickly before emergency respondents can arrive.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>To address this problem we set out to create a system in which a trained operator can be present on the scene of an  incident sooner than an ambulance with the ability to provide assistance in any way they can. A drone can bypass local traffic and arrive at the scene sooner than any other vehicle. A video and audio feed allows the trained operator to interact with civilians in the area providing medical assistance and advice to help ease the severity of the situation while emergency respondents are on their way. As well as providing assistance to any victims, it also gives emergency respondents valuable data that they can use to help prepare themselves before they arrive on the scene.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>the system came in three parts, the operators interface, the drone, and the victim. the operator had a live feed from the drone so that and manual controls of the drones avionics, the drone had some basic autonomous obstacle avoidance and stability assist, and the victim could interact with the operator with drones speaker and microphone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some challenges we ran into was giving the operator and victim real time communications through the drone after the drone arrived at the scene.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the idea behind FRED because we truely believe it can help in improve the effectiveness of emergency respondents and help save lives.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team gained a lot of new experience and knowledge over the 36 hours of Hack AZ.  We learned how to write mobile apps for Android and Pebble, and learned how to interface these with an online web app (also custom built).

In addition, it uses IR sensors to help in autonomously navigating the area.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it by tearing apart the drone to integrate an Arduino on top of installing node.js on the internal software. Using the Arduino, we integrated two IR sensors that were to be used in obstacle avoidance in the drone's autonomous flight routine. Then, after quite a bit of struggling, we managed to get the serial data from the Arduino back to the drone, into node.js, and then, finally, back to the host PC. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Everything. We spent nearly an entire day trying to avoid tearing the drone apart by transferring the Arduino serial data over the drone's USB port near the battery, but after asking numerous mentors, that ended up getting absolutely nowhere. As a result, we gave up on that approach and followed the common path of tearing off the bottom of the drone and interfacing through the female headers that are included in the drone's underbelly. We had to change how our drone flew to compensate for the additional weight added by our Arduino, breadboard, etc. Many of the APIs we worked with didn't necessarily work well together, and a large amount of them were so poorly documented that the only way to really figure out their functionality was to try them out and see what the result was.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Setting up the drone to receive commands from node.js to remote control it from our laptop, streaming data from the IR sensors hooked up to the Arduino back to the host PC, and on top of that, we're proud of our resiliency in the face of adversity.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Many on the team learned that hardware can have some other considerations to take into account than software. In addition, we gained experience in delegating roles to help meet deadlines, etc.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Patrol.AR</h2>\n<p>Possibly improving battery life, improving detection and recognition of people, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parrot\">parrot</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tropo\">tropo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sensors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">haar</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/araymer/DroneHack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/araymer/DroneHack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the hardware portion which included setting up the Arduino to read from the IR sensors, formatting the readings to be in a format that the drone's node.js server was expecting, and physically doing all of the wiring and logic-level conversion to make the Arduino talk with the drone's serial port.", "", ""]], ["HomeChef", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Thank you to Julio Hernandez, Akhila Murella, and Sarah Fallah for being on the project with us.

To promote a diverse and healthy diet, we wanted to create an app that would allow users to input ingredients they currently have and display a list of recipes they can cook without making trips to the grocery store.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app is currently just a demo in it's beginning stages. We want to be able to take a list of ingredients from the user, and given that, return recipes that only use the ingredients they have. One we get their list of ingredients, we will display a list of recipes. By clicking on the recipe, we will take them to a page within our app that displays the ingredients needed, instructions, prep time, and more. We also want a settings page for users to store common ingredients that they almost always have, to avoid repeated-checking everyday. The settings page will allow the user to configure what foods will always be checked. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this app using Swift on Xcode and Spoonacular's food-api (<a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/food-api\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://spoonacular.com/food-api</a>). </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Being beginners in Swift-programming, we found a lot of roadblocks, particularly with integrating the API. None of us have had to import an API before, and one of our team members have never even used Xcode. For our members without a mac, it was particularly difficult to configure an OSX environment on their PCs using Virtualbox. Not only was the end environment laggy, the setup took a lot of time and troubleshooting. It was a huge learning experience, but thanks to the online-coding-community and helpful mentors and fellow hackers, we were able to pull off this demo! </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very happy that we were able to upload a submission given our lack of expertise and limited time! Though our app is far from it's final, ideal form, it's an honor to share our idea with the hacking community. Throughout the hackathon, many mentors and hackers praised our idea and expressed how useful HomeChef would be in their lives. To know that our app, once just an idea, could become a reality that improves the lives of other people, is truly rewarding. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As Aaron Matos said before HackArizona began, \"every failure is just another opportunity.\" Although we did not complete the perfect app (but then again, who does on their first try?), we learned to be okay with failure (for success will surely follow!), step out of our comfort zone, go big with our ideas, and the significance of collaboration. In addition, we gained a lot of technical knowledge in APIs, Swift and Xcode, Objective-C and much more! </p>\n<h2>What's next for HomeChef</h2>\n<p>The team hopes to continue building and improving HomeChef until it is marketable. Our final goal is launching to the Apple App Store! :) </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/programmingprincess/homechef-master\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/programmingprincess/homechef-master\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Virtualix", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Virtualix \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/338/549/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Share your vision.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Think back to where you watched fireworks on the 4th of July.

Due to time restriction, we could only run the script to collect data over 3 hours from 5 am to 7:45am and were able to handle 3000 tweets and store about 200 valid tweets with geolocations on most of them. The time constraint definitely made things a lot harder especially when there was so much to do.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The efficiency of our algorithms and the visualization is definitely the highlight of the application. Apart from that, the application can handle Huge data influx as some of its modules use Amazons s3 and dynamodb (currently, only for the community in IOS app). The IOS application is also able to authenticate and authorize users using Facebook login and Amazon AWS cognito. The identity pool for the app is highly scalable and allows only authenticated users to submit data but is open for all if they want to view the visualization results.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Data mining algorithms like apriori, fpgrowth and some fuzzy logic. IOS App development with objective-C and most importantly, the ability to work under pressure.</p>\n<h2>What's next for DTRAP</h2>\n<p>The next steps for DTRAP include adding the support of other social media platforms like Facebook and Reddit. Apart from that, the iOS application created for the disease would also take into consideration the community of DTRAP users where a user would be able to report his disease/symptoms that could be marked on the Map. Apart from that, push notifications can be sent to the users when they are about to enter an area that is marked red (possibility of an outbreak of a contagious disease).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/amit4111989/dtrap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/amit4111989/dtrap\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the back-end and front end to create twitter scrappers, classifiers and implemented algorithms along with my teammates", "", ""]], ["PlotParrot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/69z34H1EcZI?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Original idea was about marrying the power of social media to entertainment and educational appeal of the drones</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user types simple math function in the input box and the app makes the drone follow the path of the curve.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I both worked on the Nodejs website to make it more aesthetically and professionally acceptable, and on the problems and capabilities of the drone program so it is sophisticated and has some educational and entertainment value</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Working with a team, Not having a clear idea of the goal, thinking the mathematical section would be easy (as if drone would exactly follow points in space!), not taking into account that drone api adjusts speed and direction by accepting speed argument, not position.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>In 36 hours, I began an Android project, complete a Maven project (then ditched it!).

That's pretty much all we know about the origins of this idea.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>After asking for a user's preferences, the app automatically looks at nearby open restaurants that might match the user's tastes and ranks them using our home-grown algorithm. Restaurant information is then shown to the user, with the ones more lined up to the user's tastes coming on top. After the initial setup, everytime the user opens the app they will immediately see a list of restaurants matching their preferences, with the best matches on top.

Users can also beam overviews of the top matching restaurants to their Pebble watch in order for quicker access.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Open Now is an android application with a Pebble watch extension. It is built on top of both the Yelp and Google Places APIs. Open Now would not have been possible without the great folks over at Stack Overflow.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were two recurring themes to the problems that we encountered throughout the development of Open Now: Android Studio issues and API issues. Though there were issues in writing the app code as well, those - for the most part - were resolved quickly. Android Studio had a tendency to break the project every time someone decided to pull in the latest commit, which resulted in spending a lot of hours of fixing the project files.</p>\n<p>There were also issues in properly integrating the Yelp and Google Places API into the app. Since Yelp does not release certain information to API users, it was impossible to get all the data we wanted to show the user from one source. For that reason we had to come up with a way for the Yelp API to talk with the Google Places API, which had the rest of the information we wanted.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>The accomplishment that we are proud of most is that we were able to put together a product that we are satisfied with, especially considering how unfamiliar some of us were with the technologies we decided to use. Developing basic smartwatch features was also very satisfying.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot of new technologies throughout the course of Hack AZ, as well as how we could creatively apply them in order to make what we want. We also learned a lot about time management and effective task delegation as we constantly shifted and added requirements.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Open Now</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"

college students in a new town, we realized just how hard and intimidating it is to make doctors and dentist appointments. You really have no guidelines on where to go, what to look for, and -- most importantly -- who accepts your insurance. We wanted to make a web app that's easy and pleasant to use in order to schedule appointments with health care providers, without being put on hold.</p>\n<p>There are so many people who have trouble accessing health care and because of this, their well-being takes a backseat. We want everyone to have the resources they need to find the health care provider that's perfect for them. Every time. Cheers to good health!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app allows a patient to securely register their location and insurance information to expedite check-in. They can search based on services and specializations of health providers to find the right provider for their needs. Once they find a provider they like, they tell us a little about what schedule works for them and we'll do the rest.</p>\n<p>Since we give provider recommendations dependent on the patient's insurance, there's no need to worry about shocking prices or surprise charges. We know that life can get busy, so we also take care of recurring appointments so you'll never forget your routine check-up. When the time comes, we remind you by text and create a Google Calendar event just so you can easily plan ahead.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this app using a bunch of different technologies. During the opening ceremony, there's was a consistent theme of learning which we set out to do in spades. We have two apps communicating with each other: one that handles the front-end and back-end for the patient and one that simulates the back-end for the physician's office. Our front-end is made using Ruby on Rails with a fully functional back-end written using Postgres, Geocoder API, Google Maps API, and Devise Authentication. We had our team's designer make a workflow and designs for the front-end which we implemented with her help. </p>\n<p>We implemented the physician's side using Sinatra. This part of the app had the purpose of simulating receiving incoming requests from patients and relaying approvals to those patients with a robot caller using the Tropo API provided by Cisco. Our robot caller asks patients to confirm an appointment time and we subsequently send them a text message confirming their appointment using Tropo and set a reminder to their calendar using Google Calendar API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A big challenge to writing two apps that need to communicate with each other is what stands in the middle in order to facilitate communication. We ended up using Amazon's SNS and SQS services in order to create a fault tolerant method of communication between the two apps. The Rails front-end queues up notifications into SNS and the Sinatra back-end polls for messages on SQS which it then handles. This architecture would be scalable to an actual solution with many physician's offices connected to our front-end; this also allows for an app to crash or fail and the messages will not be lost, we handle them when the app is back up again.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>There's many things that we're proud of with this project. We were able to use so much knowledge and expertise from our team to build something (we think) is truly special. Even though we used so many APIs, they all work together quite seamlessly and we have a workflow that clearly demonstrates our idea and where we can head in the future.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Never give up! Engineers need designers!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Salud</h2>\n<p>Some other ideas we thought of implementing in the future are ratings, reviews, and a central data store. Making the code cleaner is also on the agenda. :-)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sinatra\">sinatra</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-sns\">amazon-sns</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tropo\">tropo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-calendar\">google-calendar</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sms</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/robotalker\">robotalker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">devise</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/geocoder\">geocoder</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oauth\">oauth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/x071xdqgzwj4d5q/SaludHackTest-master.zip?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/x071xdqgzwj4d5q/SaludHackTest-master.zip?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7fo3yh1l62hlv2q/doc_backend.zip?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7fo3yh1l62hlv2q/doc_backend.zip?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/danielboros/salud-backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/danielboros/salud-backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/amphithere/salud-front-end\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/amphithere/salud-front-end\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the back-end and communication between the two apps.

After a some rather interesting brain storming, we kind of stumbled across the idea of tinder for dogs and wrote it off. We kept trying to move on, but the conversation always seemed to gravitate back towards this idea. It took some refining before we finally found a good approach that would help people, shelters, and lonely dogs searching for homes. The idea for the website quickly turned into a one stop shop for everything you would need to know about adopting a dog. A breed encyclopedia, doggie cost calculators, a search engine to find your next furry friend, and the capability for shelters to update dog information easily and avoid paperwork and complaints about how hard it is to find dogs on their websites.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This website gathers tons of information about dogs and owning dogs, as well as lets you search for dogs once you've determined you are ready for one and have some specifications in mind. It also allows shelters to easily add information on dogs they are housing.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This website uses html, javascript and css for the most part. We decided to keep it very basic because only two members of our team had any experience with web programming, and only one that is going to school for computer science. Everyone learned a ton of new things while working on this project!</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Having so many inexperienced members on our team became quite the challenge. We had grand ideas for this site but only got to implement a very small portion of them. Some of our features broke when moving form the local machine to the web too and there was not enough time to troubleshoot. We have most of the aesthetic pieces up for the purpose of presenting the idea and have grand plans for the future of this site.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The biggest accomplishment of the weekend was actually the idea development. When we came in on Friday, we had no idea what we wanted to work on and now we have the skeleton of what could be a great asset for the canine community.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK! Web programming is something that a lot of people take for granted because we are constantly on the internet. It's really a lot of work, sometimes for the simplest things. We also learned that it felt great when you finally got that one thing to work that you've been fiddling with for hours. Our team is also awesome and we spent long hours bouncing ideas off of one another, both serious and silly. Laughter is the best way to make a daunting task seem a little more manageable. Next time we attend an event like this, we might try to find a project that is a little more feasible in the allotted time.

Congressmen are so worried about financing their reelection campaigns that they ignore the will of the general public. Since it is legal for corporate lobbyists to donate unlimited amounts of money to political campaigns, we feel that it is necessary for the American public to band together and fight the legal corruption present in our political system.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We provide a platform to crowdfund community lobbyists that will represent the opinions of the general public in government politics. Issues are broken into 3 subsections: local, state and national issues. These issues are then funded by individual donations which will be used to pay for the services of a professional lobbyist. At the beginning, we will work with polling agencies to identify widely supported issues and ultimately raise capital to influence legislation in favor of the American people. For example, universal background checks for firearm purchases are supported by about 90% of the American public, however any legislation in favor of these background checks is shot down by the NRA (pun intended). The NRA is able to block legislation by using large amounts of money to lobby government officials. In this example, our website would allow the American people to crowdfund professional lobbyists to counter the NRA's campaigns.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a LAMP stack environment to create a website that would allow registered users to submit, support, and donate to issues that are widely supported. We used MySQL to store important political issues and data to display on our webpage. We used bootstrap to create an intuitive interface that simple and easy to use. PHP was used to control events between the view and the database. Javascript and jQuery was used to format the data on the pages and in some cases asynchronously load information from the database. Additionally, we used xampp as our test environment and Git as our version control system.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had problems with developing a MySQL database that fit the requirements for our website and could also be scaled up. All members in our group were new to Git. We ran into some issues with getting merge conflicts between the sync cycles. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to get most of our idea done that we wanted to in a timely fashion. We were able to design something that hadn't been done before with it being our own original idea. We did research on other similar websites but really made a point to distinguish our project and make an innovative solution to an important issue. Some of the other websites focused on campaign elections and controversial issues which hindered the effectiveness of the website and they fell short. The lobbying factor of our website is what makes it really stand apart from the others. We are proud that we say that our website fully gives power to people and helps solve real world problems.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about the importance of prototyping and laying out a concrete idea with manageable steps. We also learned the importance of communication between teammates and how much it affected our group when programming with multiple people at the same time. </p>\n<h2>What's next for The Lobbyists</h2>\n<p>The more we worked on this project, the more we wanted to implement it in a real world scenario. We started to see the real value in having a website like this go live and have it help people get real world issues resolved. This project was started because we had an idea of a way to help stop political corruption, and we now think that this idea is extremely realistic. Corruption in politics due to corporate money is clearly an important issue that has no current solution. If we were to implement this idea, a logical next step would be to partner with a professional marketing and lobbying firm, as their professional services and knowledge will allow us to implement our idea more efficiently.  We hope that our website will help the future of our country and will give people the chance to participate in political decision making.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I came up with the idea for the website and I assisted with database design, page layout / styling, and I wrote the php scripts that managed sessions and controlled the the flow between the php model and the views.", "Did most of the design on the front end using html, css, javscript, and jquery.

Raytheon drones are known for many things, including the fact that you can watch things via the attached camera. Video surveillance is important in the world, but as technology progressions, as should we with it. Let's take a step towards such a concept.</h2>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>The framework of programs that will, in the future, be attached to a Raytheon Drone equipped with a powerful Wireless Adapter/Network Security Key Cracker. The drones would fly within Network range of the IP that warrants such surveillance, crack into that network and plant the program \"Raycaster\" into the remote machine. It will then connect to a Server called \"Scion\" and let a plethora of surveillance, and even some control, over that remote machine. It affords the user many things including constant video stream of the remote machine's desktop, allows full navigation of the machine's C:/ Drive with access to uploading, downloading, previewing, deleting, and even opening files on the remote machine. The user is also afforded a direct command line script that runs a stealthed Command Prompt on the remote machine, runs commands into it, and returns the feedback to the user, offering an even greater level of control. While the Scion Server has a clean Graphical User Interface with plenty of UI options, the Raycaster counter program is completely stealthed and isn't detected as an active process on the remote machine. \nIn it's current state, it does not utilize drones nor the wireless breaching that was mentioned, however the program is fully functional and can be ran and treated as if those steps were already complete.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Utilizing Java Sockets as well as something I call \"Command Tags\" which, when dealing with a program like this, are tags used at the beginning of strings sent via Client-Server connections to tell what's about to be sent and how to handle it. It's written in Java, which is detrimental to a program as this as Java operates in a JVM, meaning I could not attach a keylogger directly to the remote machine as the keylisteners only read keys that are typed in the JVM itself. As programming skills in other languages progress, so will this program and it's capabilities. Multiple Sockets going back and forth on two seperates programs are a key function to achieving so many different functions at once. I.E live video stream on one port, while transferring files covertly on another. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Threads were a big deal in the beginning, and was synchronization. Once that was down, it was all about syncing my command line tags from client to server to allow fluent communication. The video stream was rough, because it's nested inside of a nice little \"for\" loop. It takes a screenshot of the remote machine every 75 milliseconds and streams it across server, which is then set as the image in the \"screen window\" of the Scion GUI. I'd imagine this is a very inefficient way of doing things and I'm sure better ways to accomplish this exist, however, streaming a screen didn't seem to be a common function in Java and this was the best workaround I could manage. More time would allow more proficient and effective code with less processing power.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting this program to work honestly. I have a very small amount of schooling in computer science, however I have been self taught for a couple years now. So seeing the GUI work and Java sockets come together, while working with threads and synchronization was something I was proud of when making this. Coding is something that I am truly passionate about, and seeing my work come to live really makes me feel like one day, I'll make a difference in the world. Be the change that I want to be.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Synchronization is a pretty big deal when dealing with concurrent threading. Running multiple threads is a big deal in general. When dealing with sockets, it's important to understand that in order for a file to be transferred, you must close the socket and the input streams otherwise it wont transfer bytes correctly. When making a GUI, JLabels are your best friend. And when things get tough, a couple red bulls will help you pull through.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rayconaissance</h2>\n<p>A lot more payloads and control over the remote machine, including a stream of the webcam, audio stream, and control over the mouse. A keylogger will also be implemented with filters for keylogging, when it streams desktop/webcam/audio, and a rootkit to be implemented so once it's ran once, it will forever run on startup on the remote machine.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["SafeStride", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There are many times in life where we just do not feel safe. We just want to feel as if we have someone next to us. Soon enough we realize that people can't just accompany us all the time. It is however the 21st Century and there are many kinds of applications, but none seem to bring the sense of security. <strong>Until now, introducing, SafeStride</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SafeStride is the app that aims to provide the user with additional security when traveling alone. Embedded integration with the Apple Watch, a user is able to call someone, text someone, or even update your friends with your current coordinates of your location. We want our users to feel safe and be able to quickly call for help or relay their exact location in the case of an emergency situation. SafeStride has a high performance platform that works with upload speeds faster than 2 seconds. SafeStride will notify others if you are in danger in the fastest way possible whether that be through a text message, a call, or GPS coordinates of your current location.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Coded in Swift in Xcode 7.2.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>It was quite a challenge getting the stand alone iOS app out first. After we felt we had perfected the iOS app, we felt the need to have almost all of those functionalities from the iOS app in the Watch OS app as well. In the end, we ran into a brick wall and had to scratch many of the great features we had originally planned, <strong>but</strong> we still feel as if we have created a great product that is able to provide users a little more peace of mind.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>First of all, it was an honor to have had the opportunity to build a project this year at Hack Arizona 2016. We were inspired by StateFarm after attending their workshop on how to write our first Apple Watch app. This led us to build an app which pertained to what they do. Much like an insurance company, our app is for personal satisfaction and a sense of safety. We are very proud to have a finished product that we are all happy with and to have accomplished and learned as much as we have in such a short time frame. </p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>None of us have had coded for Swift or in Xcode until this weekend. We started on Friday and finished on Sunday. We learned a lot of time management and a lot about how iOS apps work and how much in depth some simple tasks may require.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SafeStride</h2>\n<p>As we continue to learn and develop our Swift / Xcode skills, we plan to implement some of the ideas that we did not get a chance to start this weekend such as utilizing the apple HealthKit to access heart rate monitoring data in order to detect sudden heart rate increases that may suggest an emergency situation. This quick response is important to give you the best chance possible in a tough situation by contacting local authorities or emergency personnel. Another idea that we would like to keep developing on is a GPS route and an emergency contact system that would contact authorities if you are tracked as straying from your planned route for whatever reason.

For the Hackathon, we decided to curate our first run of Mobievent towards the Student Union. We decided on three top features out of the countless possibilities. With Mobievent we, in the future can see this being used not only for schools but for hotels, airports, sports arenas, and even the ability to track people down in emergency situations. This is something that can make a huge difference in the way people go about their day. The inspiration comes from the passion of wanting to make a difference and create a new level of personal interaction with environments.</h2>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>We developed a system that uses iBeacon technology (Bluetooth 4.0 + Raspberry Pi's) to allow for an IPS (Indoor Positioning System) to be used throughout school. Sure the technology exists but it stumped us as to why we hadn't seen anyone doing what we aim to do.  Due to time constraints with such a huge vision, we focused on three points in the Student Union for this weekend. The first feature we thought would have a big impact on the student body is automating the textbook system. The vision is, iBeacons are placed at the front of the Bookstore. UAccess is fully integrated   is the main hub for students and textbooks there When a student walks by, they are picked up by the beacon and are sent a notification that asks if they'd like to reserve their textbooks. Their textbook lists are then accessed and pulled from the UAccess database and   The students then select the textbooks he/she wants and that is then sent downstairs via a request on internal computers to begin the process of pulling the books. The user is sent a time as to how long it will take (calculated based on how many reservations) and they can then use the indoor mapping system to locate supplies or apparel they may need which can help cut the time and keep it as consistent as possible. The second space we planned for was the good ol' classroom. The student walks through a beacon outfitted class and is checked in for their attendance. The professor can then check the attendance to double check, just in case someone does not have a smartphone. The app, now being recognized as in a classroom, shifts to 3 options. Attendance, an app wide UAccess tab, and now a clicker integrated into it. No need to spend $100 on a dinky clicker!!!! If a student who is not registered for that class walks in, they will receive a notification they are in the wrong room and have the option of being routed in the case of them getting lost. The teacher is also notified of the student for safety purposes as well as academic integrity purposes. The third is an option for a map that will be on every \"live-page\" What I mean by this is since the beacons have amazing accuracy, when you are near Mckale Center the U of A app will have its app wide features as well as some that are only available by Mckale. This includes taking the classes option, moving it to a non central-focused space and replace it with a news and tickets interface. The map is the main hub for this school and this experience. This is just a sliver of the amazing concepts our group has come up with in just 36 hours. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>getting the server running but was aided by a mentor from Google to get it going.</li>\n<li>Creating a decent looking rapid prototype on an iPad (Self-Challenge) with no experience with the app.</li>\n<li>Learning python, Rest architecture, JSON.</li>\n<li>Realized we can't outfit the entire school. </li>\n<li>Figuring workarounds for interferences. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Our team and every other team</li>\n<li>Learned from scratch and made a pretty sweet UI rapid prototype, fully on the iPad. </li>\n<li>The way all of our collaborative ideas easily molded into one enormous vision.</li>\n<li>Getting the database to work with Python.</li>\n<li>Taking a new technology that 2 out of 4 of us knew nothing about and learning about them. </li>\n<li>Discovering the insane amount of ways this can be used and developing a mutual passion in just days!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Sleep who?</li>\n<li>My brain as well as my teammates are literally so tired writing this, it was near impossible for us to list anything because there was such an endless amount of things to list that we had learned. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Mobievent</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Well! with the bond we developed over the weekend we all realized we make an amazing team.

However, with the controversially high price point of the Oculus Rift and its incredibly demanding suggested computer specs, we're still a ways away from having that kind of virtual reality in most of our homes.</p>\n<p>Because of this, we see the possibility of a rise in a more modest but still incredibly powerful kind of virtual reality in the form of Google Cardboard. We see its limitations as a challenge to make the most out of a highly accessible platform that nearly anybody with a smart phone can get their hands on.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Cardboard Calamity is a multiplayer team-building body-swapping virtual reality game. At least two players have phones with Google Cardboard, which connect with the central server to interact with each other. Each phone records what is in front of them using the front-facing camera. The twist is that players are only be able to see what is in front of their partner, not themselves. One player is tasked with building a simple to moderately complex Lego object with the guidance of their partner.</p>\n<p>The helper will have nothing in front of them in actuality, but will be able to see the instructions sheet and Lego pieces in front of the builder. The builder will not be able to see the pieces or the instructions, and can only be guided by the voice and gestures of the helper, and their own feeling around.</p>\n<p>We are also looking to implement a competitive mode with at least four people as two pairs of builders and helpers. Teams will gain points as they complete challenges that they can spend on power-ups to give their team an advantage (including one that would put the players in their own bodies temporarily) and power-downs to mess up the apposing team (like one that flips the vision of the opposing builder). The first to complete all the challenges wins.</p>\n<p>The game was built from the ground up to encourage teamwork. It would be great for educational and business team building.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The game is an Android app written in Java using the Cardboard API. We based our early development on an open source project called Cardboard Passthrough, which formats camera input in a way that looks natural while wearing Cardboard, among other basic tools. We used Android Studio as our IDE.</p>\n<p>The central server used for app intercommunication is written in Go. It exposes a REST API to the app and streams camera input using sockets. Vim was used in conjunction with the vim-go plugin as the IDE. The server is hosted on a free tier Amazon AWS server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Cardboard API does not itself provide a tool for converting camera input into a Cardboard-friendly form. Luckily, we found Cardboard Passthrough, which helped us significantly with this problem.</p>\n<p>For some reason, Android Studio would not generate Gradle wrappers properly when we imported projects straight from Github. It took a lot of tinkering with Gradle scripts before we found a workaround.</p>\n<p>We spent hours trying to figure out why our app seemed unable to connect to the server's streaming socket to transfer data. The solution was a boring and silly fix, but it took a long time to figure out.</p>\n<p>We had a very tough time getting a usable video stream from the Android camera. The API is built with only app-internal use in mind, so transferring it through a socket involves using a tricky \"hack\" that we could never get working. Camera streaming is integral to implementing this game and this challenge ultimately kept us from finishing the project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, we're very proud of our idea. Google Cardboard is a platform with incredible accessibility and potential, which is matched only by its limitations. Being limited to one button and a mobile platform makes traditional gaming a non-option on Cardboard, but our idea fits nicely into the constraints of this platform and benefits hugely by its simplicity and openness.</p>\n<p>We're also proud of how well we were able to re-purpose existing tools to our needs. We saved a lot of development time by using Cardboard Passthrough's features, we were able to complete some unfinished portions of Cardboard Passthrough and, of course, added many of our own.</p>\n<p>Cardboard Calamity's user interface is minimal, but what we have is stylish, appealing, and simple. Look no further than our logo for a taste of Cardboard Calamity's look and feel.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about the basics of Gradle version control, specifically about the wrapping process it does when a project is newly added to a computer.</p>\n<p>We gained more general Java experience, especially in the mid-to-low-level graphical and networking areas, with OpenGL and sockets.</p>\n<p>We learned more than we bargained for about the Android camera API, specifically on how to interact with it at a low level.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cardboard Calamity</h2>\n<p>The first goal we have is to find a solution to the camera video streaming problem. From there, we want to improve how reliably the app interacts with the server. Then we would add 4+ player support, buffs, debuffs, and a scoring system.</p>\n<p>We as a group would like to experiment further on how Google Cardboard and accessible virtual reality in general can provide new and fun experiences.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vim\">vim</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cardboardcrusaders\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cardboardcrusaders\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I brainstormed and helped with concept development.

For example, when we go to a career fair, we wait for a long time before we get to meet recruiters. So we thought about bringing this queuing system online so people don't have to physically BE STANDING in the queue. In addition, we thought that all queuing systems work in a similar way like banks for example, where people wait in queues to get their queries answered. This was the inspiration of our project and we wanted to take out the annoyance caused by queuing delays in counters.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The system allows recruiters (who talk to students about job opportunities) and students (who visit recruiters and want to learn about opportunities) come together and prepare queuing schedules. For example, a recruiter from Amazon might decide that he wants to talk to 300 students today while a recruiter from another company may decide to talk to 200 students, say. Students can then book slots which allocates \"tokens\" to students that indicate which position in the queue a student is in, as well as provide an estimate of waiting time. Since this is a virtual system, students can stand in more than one queue at the same time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We planned on developing APIs that other applications can use to perform queuing-related tasks. We then planned on using REST API because of the various advantages it offers in terms of simplicity and scalability and we targeted mobile users. Since we had members skilled in a variety of areas, we used Java and C# .NET for development. We finally built a prototype for mobile browsers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>1) Scheduling was a big problem that we ran into and we had to deal with deadlocks. \n2) To make queuing fair for everyone, we direct users to be physically present whenever appropriate. \n3) We needed to identify and collect required data for predicting wait times.\n4) To implement all of these features, we found it incredibly difficult to come up with general APIs, so we built the application for mobile browsers and not for native apps.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>1) Scalable\n2) Can be applied in any scenario where there are people standing in a line.\n3) Allows for people to stand in more than one queue. A student gets to move forward in a queue virtually even though the student is physically present in another queue. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>1) How not to sleep for close to 36 hours at a stretch\n2) Front-end UI frameworks such as bootstrap and back-end application development such as the .NET framework</p>\n<h2>What's next for Virtual Queue</h2>\n<p>1) Prediction of accurate wait

This led us to develop BubblePlot, a Processing sketch that creates new potential for how we visualize data.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>BobblePlot uses the Myo for Processing library to incorporate the Myo's gesture recognition into a interactive visualization of a data. Here's what each of the recognized gestures does:</p>\n<p><strong>Fist</strong>: Collapse Bubbles to the center of the sketch, cycle the value the Bubbles are sized and sorted by, and redraw the Bubbles.</p>\n<p><strong>Fingers Spread</strong>: Cycle the text entry of each Bubble or turn text off.

The sketch then draws each Bubble where the relative sizes represent relative values for the data. The user can then interact with the data using the various gestures in order to create a fluid, intuitive presentation of the data.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote a python script to read in a csv file and create the format string used by Processing sketch by recognizing whether the data was a number or a string.

We set out to prevent this from happening again.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our contraption analyzes a motorized device's amplitude frequency response of the power supply. In a nutshell, it attempts to predict when a motor is about to fail and warn the user via text message.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use the analog input on an Arduino to sample (a scaled down [simulated] version) of the power supply to a motor. We then use software (specifically a very light-weight implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform) to break the signal into its component frequencies. The device should then look at and compare the side lobes for a changing profile as this is one of the earliest indicators of imminent failure. If this is detected, then a message is sent to a Raspberry Pi acting as a central command server, triggering an SOS SMS to all interested parties (included at installation in the notification script). </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We started the project with the intent of using an Intel Edison development board for the brains, but several hours (and over a hundred browser tabs) later, our computers resolutely refused to communicate with the Edison. On day two, we switched to an Arduino Uno.\nOur next challenge was in finding a data source to emulate a failing motor. Every test did, and (as of the time of this writing) continues to inform us that the motor is not only dying but has died, been zombified and is currently out looking for brains.\nThe third major challenge so far has been dealing with the low resolution mandated by extremely tight memory constraints (our entire signal analysis process uses less than two kilobytes).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of our signal processing implementation. The entire analysis process takes place inside the Arduino Uno, with the matlab script being used solely to display the data sent to the computer via a serial line.\nWe are also excited to announce that our entire source code is available for download on github! Check out our repository at imminentthreat.me</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Hardware development is hard. But rewarding when things finally work! One of our younger members learned a host of new things about data processing (FFT...). </p>\n<h2>What's next for Imminent Threat</h2>\n<p>We want to transplant Imminent Threat to a platform with greater processing capabilities and memory assets, so we can run live tests with high resolution data. In particular, it would be beneficial to use a floating-point-based FFT with more bins to reveal the structure of the sidelobes.  We are releasing all of the code as open source, so please take it and do something awesome!

People, including large internet personalities, have even attempted to immerse themselves by painting along with a Bob Ross episode. Carrying around a hunk of materials and having to replace the canvas of an easel after every painting can be cumbersome, though. This is where the motivation for The Joy of Painting With Bob Ross in Virtual Reality comes from. With this project, players can paint endlessly without having to worry about replacing painting supplies.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Joy of Painting in Virtual Reality is a simulator that uses Oculus Rift and Leap Motion. The goal is for the player to paint along with whichever Bob Ross episode they choose.</p>\n<p>The player is placed in a room. In front of the player is a painting canvas and an old television with controls for a few different Bob Ross painting episodes. If the player looks down with the Oculus Rift, then a color palette will appear. The player can select and mix colors. After selecting a color, they can use Leap Motion controls to paint on the canvas.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The Oculus was incompatible with all of our laptops. We tried multiple things, such as downgrading operating systems and trying different versions of the utility, before deciding that it must be an incompatibility with our mobile GPUs. We didn't want to let this stop us from developing in Oculus, however, and Wes offered to drive us to Chris Brown's house to pick up his desktop PC. The drive was over 40 minutes, but it was worth it since all incompatibility issues vanished with the desktop.</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Joy of Painting in Virtual Reality</h2>\n<p>Our goal is to make Joy of Painting compatible with non-VR users. It should work out-of-the-box with either Oculus + Leap Motion, controller, or keyboard + mouse. We also plan on allowing users to store their finished paintings on the wall in the room. Lastly, we wish to use some form of machine learning to calculate an accuracy score between Bob's painting and the player's painting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/glsl\">glsl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Devlix/bobross\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Devlix/bobross\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I implemented the functionality for Bob Ross videos to be played on a television asset.
