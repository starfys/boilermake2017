These components all needed to communicate in a thread-safe concurrent manner, and these channels+websockets were the primary challenge and presented lots of iterations and interesting debugging. We had some bizarre stuff happening in the terrarium!  </p>\n<p>Building a concurrent system meant that we needed to clean up all the concurrent processes our program created. This was challenging because it is hard to design a system that cleans up after itself when moving so quickly to improve features. </p>\n<p>Go is not an ecosystem that our entire team had used prior to this event, but we decided to use it as our server side for it's excellent concurrency story. This meant that half our team was getting mentored on Go best practices as we laid down the framework for Propagate, but by Saturday night we were all able to be productive and confident in the code-base.  </p>\n<p>Finally, tweaking mechanics to achieve a satisfactory ecological balance was an important challenge as Propagate came together. We wanted the ecosystem to be alive and dynamic, meaning that old plants gradually withered away to make room for young. An interesting mechanic that emerged is the way that plant's tendencies to drop spores in close proximity to themselves lead to \"forests\" of one species</p>\n<h2>Going forward</h2>\n<p>We would like to explore algorithmic iteration of Propagate programs, including generational mechanics and fitness values.

This is especially true for violent incidents, which can happen in a matter of moments and result in long lasting consequences. We believe people should have a way of recording incidents of their own, promoting accountability against unlawful acts without the threat of being identified. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Opening the AnonymEyes app allows users to instantly stream low resolution video anonymously from their mobile phone to the AnonymEyes website. <strong>There is no local copy of the video, only a remote one.</strong> The videos are also location tagged and placed on a map. This data can act as a way of rapidly and discreetly alerting emergency responders while recording valuable information to them at the same time, rather than dialing EMS. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The two main interfaces to AnonymEyes are an Android app that allows the user to instantaneously record and upload a video stream, and a web application for the public to view uploaded videos. </p>\n<p>The default Android video recorder only returns a video file after the 'Stop Record' button is pressed. To achieve near-continuous live video stream, we needed to hack a way around the default API. Frames of the camera preview were taken at a fixed rate and sent via UDP packets to our Java processing server. On the Java server, the frames were compiled into a H.264 mp4 file for cross-compatibility across all web browsers. The video file is then uploaded to a shared file system between the Java server and a Ruby on Rails web server, both running on the same VM on Google Cloud Platform.</p>\n<p>Two requests are made from the Java server to the Rails server to indicate a new stream. An initial request indicates the location of the anonymous user and plots a Google maps marker. A final request is made once the video file is encoded to notify the client to load the HTML5 video. </p>\n<p>The front end built using Angular.js is dynamically updated by listening to a Firebase database.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Hacking a live video stream was a whole challenge in and of itself. It was imperative that the video was uploaded as soon as possible to the remote server due to the nature of our problem. We initially thought of transmitting whole frames of the video via UDP to our Java server. We realized that most network routers do not deal well with packets of size 1000+ bytes, therefore we had to create an algorithm to manually splice the frames into smaller vertical strips of data. </p>\n<p>The second major challenge we ran into was trying to get a Rails websockets configuration working on Google's Cloud Platform (GCP). Since Rails does not natively support websockets (yet), the gem we used creates a standalone Thin server to route websocket activity. After much frustration, we came to the conclusion that GCP was routing websocket traffic to the HTTP server (we were getting an \"unexpected response code: 200 OK\" error, which is quite counterintuitive to begin with).

One of these things is clocking in and out from work. It's incredibly important (assuming you want to get paid), but if you forget it can be almost impossible to recover your appropriate hours. We realized that clocking in and out from work should not be something prone to so much human error.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Elapsed is a timesheet solution built around convenience for both the employee and the employer. Instead of having to manually clock in and out Elapsed detects when the employee arrives at his/her desk using iBeacon technology and automatically clocks them in. When this employee leaves work to go to the break room or leave for the day the iBeacon also notices and properly clocks the employee out. The employee can then see all of their clock in and clock out times right from the app and easily graph the number of hours worked each day. Again, all of this is done automatically without the employee or employer needing to do anything.</p>\n<p>All of this data integrated directly with the employers Intuit Quickbooks account so payroll is done automatically for the employer maximizing convenience. However, we understand that something so precious such as money should have a human touch if the computer appears to make a mistake. For that reason we implemented SupportKit. If some of the data appears wrong to the employee when they look at the times listed or the graph with one click they can chat their boss. Their boss is instantly emailed with the complaint so the employee and employer can resolve the issue together.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The main app was written in Objective C for iPhone. All of the data is stored in Realm locally and then sent to the Intuit system for payroll. To manage the intuit data and deal with login, Microsoft Azure is used. The main logic is handled by utilizing iBeacon bluetooth beacons. The app just senses the bluetooth beacon corresponding to an employees desk or the iBeacon corresponding to the break room or some other location and properly clocks employees in and out based off of these locations.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>iBeacons initially were a little unreliable, but we found that using our own methods over Apple's suggested implementation of iBeacon reduced irregularities tremendously.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Elapsed</h2>\n<p>The idea of this would be for corporations to release their own distribution of this app so we would need to add easy ways for the employee to customize the app without us needing to manually edit all of this code.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibeacon\">ibeacon</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">supportkit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intuit\">intuit</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jasonscharff/elapsed\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jasonscharff/elapsed\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Every Drop Counts", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Every Drop Counts \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/177/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>While doing everyday things in the household, one of us noticed the amount of water that accidently gets used due to the high water pressure coming out of faucets.

It also send the information to a database which is built to pull the data to make analytics graphs showing the user their water consumption.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>A Hall sensor circuit on the Arduino detects a magnetic field brought about by a spinning magnet underneath a water pressure guage, which is what is used to drive the dial and increment each time a litre of water is used. This signal is amplified and serially sent to a raspberry pi, which uploads the information onto a database, all this using Node.js. Our website then pulls the data and performs simple analytics such as monthly, weekly, daily, hourly water usage, and extrapolation of usage by the end of the month. The user then has a front end method of setting a value for the amount of water consumption they would like to aim for by the end of the month (or what they wants their water bill to be). The arduino can also tighten or loosen a water faucet, which can be used in controlling the amount of water flow in a household.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Communicating the arduino and rpi through Node was extremely difficult, especially when interfacing it with Node.js, as well as the difficulties extracting information from FIrebase as our online database. It was also very difficult to troubleshoot the amplifier and conditioning circuit. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I gained heightened ability for circuit design, and learned how to interface the rpi, arduino, and web applications together with Node.js.

This was seemed to be a super convenient and secure way to store passwords and access them with just one touch. Another factor was having one secure place where we can store all our passwords without having to bother about remembering too much. We looked to our iPhone to explore what we could do with touch ID and so we began the development process.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hash is an iPhone application that connects to your desktop device and web extensions in order to successfully authenticate several user accounts seamlessly using your fingerprint via touch ID. It is simple to use, secure and convenient when ever you need to access any of your accounts.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We looked towards what would make this work and we realized that we needed to ensure that the communication between devices have to be as accurate and secure as possible. With low powered bluetooth we were able to pair the iPhone and desktop application in order to send information back and forth from the web extensions. The web extensions are anchorage of detecting what site is currently being used and what credentials need to be stored and all the vital pieces of information is synced with dropbox in order to have a secure means to transfer information. The iPhone application was needed to be able to process the information coming in and act accordingly in order to provide precise and accurate results that fulfilled the users needs.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges was with the bluetooth connection. This was due to the out of date documentation that was available for bluetoothle connection process. This took a fair bit of time to figure out along with the learning curve of adjusting to the new programming language (Swift). On the web side we struggled through insufficient documentation and had to learn how extensions worked and built from the limited knowledge we had. This included how to retrieve the right pieces of information needed from the sites and communication with the desktop applications.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The ability for the application to communicate fast with the desktop and web extensions is defiantly something that posed a challenge and it added greatly to the core functionality of hash.

Without lots of money, we couldn't build those really cool battle robots equipped with flame throwers and chain saws. Feeling bummed out, we came up with the idea that, perhaps, we can get that experience in the virtual world. We wanted a game that can deliver both the rock-solid realism from the physical world and the mind-blowing effects from the virtual world. We strongly believe that this project will create some gaming experience that we have yet seen in the market. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user will be driving around the robot and shoot virtual zombies using an Android phone. One wins if one kills all the zombies before they get to him or her. To other people, the user will just look like a maniac who is poking his or her phone rapidly and screaming at a seemingly empty space. Through the user's phone though, he or she can see many zombies roaming around and every second can be the difference between life and death (virtually). </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed the game using Unity and compiled it for Android phone. The augmented reality and marker tracking was done using Qualcomm's Vuforia. The robot was built using simple electronics components and a Teensy 3.1 microcontroller. Communication between the robot and the Android phone conducted via Bluetooth. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>For one, neither of us has used Unity nor Vuforia before. It took us a while to figure out how they work. In addition, neither of us has an Android phone (Tawfiq uses iPhone and Matthew uses Blackberry; we both use PC). So we had to borrow an old Android phone from a friend for testing purposes. In addition, finding good marker was harder than we thought. We tried out a bunch of abstract patterns, then Ghandi, Da Vinci, Issac Newton, and many other famous figures... we figured out that none of them is as good as our trusty Albert Einstein. We now have many of his picture all over the place. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We got a real, fully functional robot built from scratch and we got the core of our project idea done. We learned and developed a game using Unity from absolute beginner within these 36 hours. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about the technologies that we used of course. In addition to that we learned the way of developing products when there is a severe time constraint and lots of uncertainty. we also met a lot of like-minded and smart people. </p>\n<h2>What's next for BattleBot</h2>\n<p>We are considering to take it the next level. We want to make this into a game that is addictive and engaging. We also want this game will introduce robotics to more children and people in general. We hope to develop it into complete product and take it to the market over the next year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vuforia\">vuforia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">android-phone</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">teensy-3.1</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">robot</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tawjaw/hackTheNorth2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tawjaw/hackTheNorth2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the electronics and the software on the Robot.

Coming to Hack the North, I had just uninstalled a sketchy bitcoin mining virus on my computer, and I was contemplating making my own bot-net. Ethan was inspired by Stanford's <a href=\"https://folding.stanford.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Folding@Home</a> project, which sparked ideas in him about crowdsourced computing for a good cause. When we came together as a team, we knew we wanted to apply Bitcoin technology, and this idea for a distributed computing project for charitable causes came about.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Cryptocause uses WebWorkers to mine bitcoins inside of the browser without any miner install. This allows for both a more accessible way for individuals and charities to experiment with Bitcoin, but also for a larger potential pool of users contributing to the mining effort. These funds are funneled and held in Cryptocause's wallet through Coinbase, which we monitor with a Node backend to distribute a threshold of Bitcoin using Coinbase's API's to a charity selected from a database of charities with known Bitcoin addresses. Because Coinbase allows for users to receive Bitcoin without having created an address on the Bitcoin network, charities can also receive the funds by email notification, through which they can get paid directly to their bank account.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The mining script uses HTTP long-polling and RPC on the server to connect to a decentralized, peer-to-peer mining pool that pays out to our Coinbase address. The script itself takes advantage of WebWorkers and multithreading to maximize the computing power we can derive from the browser. We then provided real-time analytics with <a href=\"https://fastly.github.io/epoch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Epoch</a>, <a href=\"http://d3js.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">D3.js</a>, and WebSockets connected to our Node backend to give neat insights into the hash rates of the client, the total clients connected, and the pool itself over time. Our stack is hosted on Linode, which also runs <code>bitcoind</code> and P2Pool to manage payouts and statistics. The Node itself is currently using Coinbase's sandbox development environment, but could easily be changed to production should our project attract enough visitors to generate a significant amount of Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we faced</h2>\n<p>One of our primary challenges was forking <a href=\"https://github.com/derjanb/hamiyoca\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hamiyoca</a>, which provided a starting place for being able to mine Bitcoin from the browser. Being an unmaintained repository, we had to go through the repo and fix bugs in the backend that were related to now-deprecated browser technologies (we plan on submitting a good amount of pull requests in the near future). Another challenge we faced was finding an initial mining pool that supported an older mining protocol called <code>getblocktemplate</code>, as we did not have the time to implement Stratum-based browser mining during the 36 hours.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cryptocause</h2>\n<p>For the future, we're planning on maximizing the efficiency of a browser-based Bitcoin miner with Chrome's <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/native-client\" rel=\"nofollow\">Native Client</a> in order to be able to tap into lower-level technologies like GPU shaders. We also want to find a better way to integrate charity payments so that we can reach both charities with and without bitcoin wallets.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coinbase\">coinbase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eligius\">eligius</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://cryptocause.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cryptocause.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cryptocause.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ryanlieu/CharityMine\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ryanlieu/CharityMine\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Helped with implementation of front end and data visualization using d3.js and epoch.js", "Worked on creating the front-end framework and the design language for Cryptocause.

The frontend consisted of HTML/CSS and JavaScript while the backend primarily consisted of Python. Ajax calls transferred data between the two mediums.

Using the commands /giphy and /youtube, users can search through Giphy and Youtube for content that represents what they are feeling when words can't.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We attached an event listener to every element in the html hierarchy and used the react-id to get message text.

This includes the canvas, the extra button functionalities, as well as anything we pushed directly into the chat.</p>\n<p>For our canvas, we used Socket.IO to create unique rooms using the Facebook IDs of users that we received from the self-referencing profile account: facebook.com/profile.php?=73322363. From here we had access to our own vanity, our user-id, as well as all of our recent chat history which we could scrape for information about other users.

Sending http and websocket data within Facebook also proved difficult, as we were required to use SSL and TLS-enabled sockets, and had to deal with CORS and other cross-origin-related headers. </p>\n<p>Deploying on Azure also proved difficult originally: we experienced problem with a compiler dependency of a concurrency library for Python/Flask.

Early Sunday morning, however, several Heroku data centers experienced significant problems, preventing us from deploying: we ultimately transitioned to a VM on the Google Cloud Platform, which solved our problems.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of how much we finished because of the huge amount of obfuscation that Facebook has on their messenger page.

It shows the water levels (full, half full, empty), how long it's been since food was last dispensed, and the distance the hamster has ran so far that day. It also allows you to dispense food for the hamster with the click of a button and keeps track of hamster activity.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>An Arduino logs the hamster statistics. An auger powered by a microservo runs the feeding system. The water is sensed by probes placed in the water bottle at varying positions.  A range detector calculates the number of spins the wheel has turn and converts it to distance ran. Firebase was used to handle the database and website deployment. A Bootstrap template was used to kickstart the website.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had problems connecting the Raspberry Pi onto the school's network; our system is supposed to log data on the Pi continuously. We also had problems with editing the database on multiple computers at a time simultaneously, not being all that familiar with the Firebase API. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The feeding system responding to the click of a button on the site! We had never done anything that required multiple languages and components working together to do something functional so that was exciting. The range detector calculating running statistics was also pretty exciting.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Be ready to improvise when things don't go according to plan! We had the idea for the hamster cage but didn't get our parts shipped in time so we decided to cross our fingers and check out the hardware parts for rent. Also online databases are pretty cool.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hamster Home</h2>\n<p>Integration to commercial hamster cages and mobile apps, graphing the distance ran over a period of time, and expanding it to be a network of hamster owners sharing their hamster adventures.</p>\n<h2>Video Demo</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/michelle.mabuyo/videos/1078451095506236/?pnref=story\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/michelle.mabuyo/videos/1078451095506236/?pnref=story</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://hamster-home.firebaseapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hamster-home.firebaseapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hamster-home.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mabuyo/HTN-HamsterHome\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mabuyo/HTN-HamsterHome\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked with the hardware and hardware implementation side of the project.

We wanted to create something that would allow users to place orders ahead of time, make payment as seamless as possible, and find out exactly what to order from a menu.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When we started creating this project, we quickly realized the vast potential it could have for businesses. With identifiers to customer transactions, businesses would be able to measure their retention rates and this would open up a whole new aspect to analytics. Jumpp is quick to set up, so small businesses don't need to jump through hoops to get themselves out there to their customers.</p>\n<h3>Customer</h3>\n<p>Customers have a single application that provides them suggestions of places they can go eat, and specific menu items they can order. These orders can be placed ahead of time, so that it will be ready as soon as customers step in the door.</p>\n<h3>Business</h3>\n<p>By going through the Jumpp application, turnaround time is significantly decreased, leading to higher revenues and freeing up efforts towards better customer care. As the customers have accounts associated with their purchases, businesses can use that to better cater to their targeted demographic. Finally, since businesses can connect Intuit and Jumpp, it seamlessly integrates with Quickbooks and creates transactional entries automatically. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>BackEnd: FireBase\nFrontEnd: ReApp (React based mobile wrapper)\nAPIS: BrainTree, Intuit</p>\n<p>We created two applications(customer and business) that maintained real time updates through the use of FireBase and ReApp. On top of this, a listener application using NodeJS/Express was able to respond to changes in FireBase and then push these changes straight into the business owner's Intuit account. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Despite prior experience in web development, Reapp was difficult to work with initially as it had a lot of quirks from having to translate it to the iOS and Android platforms. Due to the nature of the application, we wanted it to be on as many platforms as possible, and Reapp was able to give us the web, iOS and Android.</p>\n<p>Intuit is a very large ecosystem of products, and a fair amount of additional work had to be done to add in a transaction to allow for the report generation and other various tools that Intuit provides.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This was the first time anyone in the team had used BrainTree, FireBase, Intuit or Reapp. While it was certainly a challenge to learn and hack at the same time, we managed to complete two applications that could be run on 3 distribution platforms(web,ios,android)!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>There's always new things to do things that achieve advantages and conveniences otherwise thought to be impossible. Without FireBase as our data store, it would have been a much more difficult project to set up the Flux architecture that would allow for clean/easy data access. Furthermore, FireBase was exceptionally useful in setting up with Intuit as they both supported OAuth and easily allowed for certain parts to be background services. </p>\n<p>There is a ton of cool technologies out there, it is a great challenge to figure out which ones are most in line with what you want to achieve.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Jumpp</h2>\n<p>We want to improve the experience of users for our application. For clients, we originally planned to use NLP techniques in order to improve search result quality. As for businesses, we both want to integrate it further with any existing business software they have, and provide valuable business analyticss that small businesses would not easily have any access to.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">reapp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coinbase\">coinbase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree\">braintree</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intuit\">intuit</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jqyu/c.jumpp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jqyu/c.jumpp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ju-de/jumpp-bus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ju-de/jumpp-bus\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on backend with Firebase and created service that synchronized transactions with Intuit accounts", "", "", ""]], ["HopenSource", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVOdZxcQ8TU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HopenSource \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/951/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HopenSource \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/078/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HopenSource \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/080/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HopenSource \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/119/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There are many non-profits and charities that need technological solutions, but lack the technical ability to solve these problems themselves.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We are building an application to help put programmers in contact with non-profits, charitable organizations, and low budget government programs (such as schools or parks departments) who need applications developed.

And, as undergraduates majoring in engineering and/or computer science, we don't often have time to physically go and find opportunities for community service or mentorship. We thought that it would be so awesome if we could make a <em>difference</em> in somebody else's life, someone less fortunate or less experienced than us, by anonymously (and impartially) providing them with advice.</p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>Our app randomly matches up the \"mentors\" and the \"mentees\" and allows them to chat, in a safe space, anonymously. Mentors would be experienced, busy, yet compassionate people with an interest in helping others. Mentees could be anyone, from a misunderstood teenager to someone who abuses drugs and needs to talk to someone who will not judge. Anonymity would allow to escape the stigma some perceive when they admit that they need help, emotional help and sympathy or understanding and guidance from another human being. \nIn addition, we are using the <strong>Indico</strong> API to analyze the text in the conversation and track the progress of the conversation by analyzing the effect of certain keywords, as well as the sentiment of the person expressing the words.

As college students, we are exposed to a variety of things, including alcohol. Even though we've all had educational classes or seminars in school about drinking safely, sometimes a gentle reminder can make a huge difference. That's where we came up with the idea of <strong>HappyHour</strong>, a pebble app that can keep you safe. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>HappyHour initially asks users for a couple of inputs: height, weight, and gender. These parameters will be used to calculate the blood-alcohol-content (BAC). BAC is a universal measurement of the alcohol in an individual's system. It is a complex equation that our application simplified for each individual personally. </p>\n<p>From then onwards, users can specify a '+' or a '-' button, allowing them to keep track of how many drinks they've had with a click of a button. The BAC accordingly updates and creates a vibration, reminding them about their drinks. When the BAC is above 0.08 (the legal threshold for drunk driving), HappyHour creates a longer vibration, indicating that the user should take an Uber home. A click on the <em>select</em> button will trigger an http request that the pebble sends to our node.js server, where we use Uber and Twilio API to text the user information on the nearest Uber, time required to take them home, and estimated price. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Developing on Pebble Time was a learning curve at some points, especially when we were having trouble uploading color resources and performing GET http requests to send longitude and latitude data. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are definitely proud of parsing through the Uber JSON API data, as well as setting up Pebble Time to perform GET XMLHttp requests and extract information from that to obtain the geographic coordinates of the Pebble. The entire process of getting user-selected data and displaying the BAC in real time was also difficult, but we've learned a lot in the process!</p>\n<h2>What's next for HappyHour</h2>\n<p>We hope to clean up the user interface code a bit (it's difficult to have good coding habits at hackathons!). We also hope to be releasing the app for othesrs to see and use. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/squarespace\">squarespace</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ruthjohnson95/HappyHour\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ruthjohnson95/HappyHour\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Discover", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eRYezIJGbbM?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Discover \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/321/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Discover \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/323/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Discover \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/326/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Discover \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/333/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyone has a moment when they wish to escape their day and browse their phone.

The view is then generated in an Android app, which also uses the World Bank open data to parse the latest statistics about a particular country and topic to display on the screen. Then the app connects to a website that uses the Braintree API to simplify the payment process of region-specific charities.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble with git throughout the project and we somehow couldn't pull each other's code without it affecting the machine specific IDE settings. It took us a long time to get on the same page and find an efficient way to manually merge our projects.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we proud of</h2>\n<p>Even though us four hackers come from different backgrounds, we worked together to accentuate our strengths and support our weaknesses. A neuroscience major, an arts major, a high school student, and a computer science second year- even if it seemed unlikely, we were able to make this project happen as a collaborative team.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to utilize many APIs into our project and work around the restrictions of the implementations by adding our own filters and parsing through files to find the data we need.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Discover</h2>\n<p><strong>Discover</strong> wants to go far. We want to incorporate even more charities into our app and more detailed statistics on each region that can be updated live with local news integration and disaster donation alerts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/urthecast\">urthecast</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree\">braintree</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/world-bank-data\">world-bank-data</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">json-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CongeeCafe/Discover\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CongeeCafe/Discover\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I had the opportunity to help with the ideation of the app and develop the android features and work on the UI.", "", "", ""]], ["Storefront", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZLI0aaYtBQ?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Storefront \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/146/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Storefront \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/147/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Storefront \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/153/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Storefront \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/157/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When I was in New York recently, I noticed how painful retail is.

With satellite imagery and tracking, to name just a few, the possibilities are endless. The ability to see parts of the Earth from the opposite side of planet are made possible with Urthecast.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we wanted to inspire people to explore the world around them more and visit geographical landmarks they wouldn't otherwise think of visiting. We want to encourage people to explore new places, encounter new experiences and friends, and earn prizes for doing so.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Epoch is a mobile game that allows users to track down the position of satellites at various geographic landmarks to earn rewards. Think geocaching, but the geocache is 400 km above you, travelling at 17000 mph, and it circles the Earth about 16 times a day. It is quite literally taking geocaching to new heights.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using the Urthecast API, we built our own API for our android client using mongodb, express, and node. Our android client calls our API which in turn calls Urthecast's API in order to obtain information about the position and time-stamps of satellites. The processing, such as distance calculations and point totals are handled on our server-side node app and sent back to the android client for display. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Well, let us tell you about heroku. We were ready to do our final round of testing this morning only to find that heroku had, simply put, died. Heroku is crucial as it hosts our node app which is the essential middleware between the android client and Urthecast's API. Finding a new deployment platform and then testing has been fun. As I write this, we are still finalizing testing. Hooray for crunch time!</p>\n<p>JavaScript was interesting due to its asynchronous nature. One of our functions runs a for loop and within this for loop we have HTTP requests. It was our understanding that HTTP requests are started on separate threads while the for loop continues to iterate. Our loop ends and invokes a callback function before we have sent all our requests and received necessary data. We needed to play around with waterfalls and the placement of callback functions in order to combat this. </p>\n<p>One of our teammates had a fever for all of Saturday so communicating ideas remotely and collaborating was difficult, but also showed the power of the tech we have as we were able to achieve quite a bit.</p>\n<p>Urthecast's platform came out of private beta 2 days ago. So, there wasn't Stack Overflow (dun dun dunnnn). All kidding aside, it is a brand new platform that was a lot of fun to work with but we had to learn a lot of new information in a short period of time to figure out how to use the API and what we needed to get and send to their endpoints. The Urthecast team was very helpful this weekend. Special thanks to Kyle, Nate, and Alex from Urthecast for their help this weekend. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our API works famously. It connects fantastically to Urthecast API and receives and sends the right data very consistently. </p>\n<p>The algorithm to dynamically generate a list of challenges available to a user was very difficult, but we managed to implement. The points algorithm was easy conceptually but quite a bit of data had to be processed to generate the correct output. </p>\n<p>\"The android app in general because Ian is a g\" -Banky, September 2015</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>Have a back up plan for deployment on the back end, waterfalls in JavaScript.

For example, if you were in a foreign country, you can use our application to look at the signs/text around you for a quick translation.</p>\n<p>The application is also integrated with the Myo for the user to take pictures for translation, and to zoom in/out of pictures for a better view.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built CardboardTranslate as an Android application using Android Studio. For text recognition and translation, our input is gathered from the camera and is processed using Tesseract an open source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library. To prevent a bad read from the image, we've implemented various techniques to pre-process the image, eliminate special characters, and detect when gibberish is read. The output we get from the OCR is then translated using the Google Translate API. We used the Myo SDK to listen for poses and link them with their appropriate tasks.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge we ran into is to ensure the accuracy of our text recognition. For example, Tesseract seeing text when there isn't any, or finding special characters.We were able to overcome this by doing pre-processing the image before using Tesseract, and also post-processing the output we get to detect gibberish.</p>\n<p>Our second challenge was the accuracy of the Myo. It was hard to get specific actions to register so we were getting behaviour that the user did not intend to create. We were able to make this better by making sure the Myo is put on correctly and to allow multiple gestures for a specific task.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tesseract\">tesseract</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/angelgao/HTN2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/angelgao/HTN2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Implemented processing text from images and translating the text.", "Myo interface and UI.", "Google Cloud Platform Translate API", ""]], ["TravelFaces", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TravelFaces \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/008/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted pebble to be more reactive for someone traveling.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Based on your location, it creates a custom watchface showing a selected image from your surroundings.

It also does not have a smooth way to transfer images over bluetooth from the phone to the Pebble watch, unlike transferring text, so we had to build our own transfer methods.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to successfully convert new images to bitmaps and cut them up into bytes and transfer them over bluetooth to the Pebble watch.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to program watchfaces for Pebble in C. How to transfer data in chunks and reconstruct the info later. Image processing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TravelFaces</h2>\n<p>Add weather information to the watchface.

Desperately looking for a Hack-a-thon idea, when we looked outside from our 3rd floor E5 window all we saw was this amazing campus, but in the midst of its beauty we also saw a lack of trees. So we came together as a team and created a plan, a business model to help this cause. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Takes picture of trees which are in need of attention or need caring for and allows user to share this picture on social media (Facebook) and spread social word about the condition of said trees.

Having a location you know you can store some valuables in, get a couple of hours of sleep on more than just a hard chair, and maybe even take a shower, could make a large difference to the hackathon experience. And what's more, hackers can make new friends in the process, as they let others use their space.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>sleephacks</em> connects hackers attending hackathons with people in the area around these hackathons. The web app makes it very easy for hackers with extra space or facilities to make themselves known, as logging in and creating a listing takes under 2 minutes. The application allows hackers to post a message with their listing, discussing what they can provide, who they are comfortable with hosting, and if they require compensation, so matches can quickly be made based on need.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the app using Google Cloud services, with a python &amp; webapp2 base, and a NDB data backend. The backend scrapes the MLH website to list all upcoming hackathons, and automatically creates a new data model for every hackathon as it's start date gets close. We built this application with the simple webapp2 framework as it allows quick development and easy updates and changes. </p>\n<p>For the frontend, we built our design from the ground up, using straight up HTML and CSS, without any frameworks. We designed the frontend and backend simultaneously, making sure they interfaced properly so when it was finally time to put the application together, we had it running very quickly.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning a new framework in 36 hours, and building a full application with it. We had never used python for any web design before this hack, and the decision to use python meant that we had to learn on the job. The end result was worth it as we learned both a new tool, Google App Engine, and a new framework, webapp2. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Having gone from a paper design to a working webapp in less than 30 hours, leaving us with ample time before the end of the hackathon to iron out any errors in the program, remove bugs, and tweak the user interface. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Don't build too deep into one feature before setting up the framework for the entire project. At one point, I had to re-write a portion of the backend because one feature became incompatible with another, simply because they were both developed separately. If a developer builds too much of one feature at a time they lose touch of the overall picture.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sleephacks</h2>\n<p>Extending to hackathons beyond MLH: \n<em>sleephacks</em> just works for MLH hackathons right now, simply because this is the site we decided to scrape. A next step would be to extend this website to include more hackathons, possibly to every hackathon in the world.</p>\n<p>Other methods of sign in:\nThe only way to sign into <em>sleephacks</em> as of now is through Google. While we decided it was the most likely common ground for hackers, it is by no means sufficient to capture every single hacker. Facebook, twitter, github and LinkedIn integration should all be supported down the line.</p>\n<p>Big differences: An important update to <em>sleephacks</em> would be to extend how hackers can connect with one another. As of right now, email is the only way. An in-application method of communication would help to preserve hacker's privacy and personal contact details. </p>\n<p><em>sleephacks</em> can also be extended by a more robust sorting system, with built-in filters to help narrow down the kind of accommodation or resources that are provided. This could be further enhanced by adding more categories to the listing addition system to include paramaters for showers, mattresses and so on</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webapp2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ndb</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://gcp-hackthenorth-3042.appspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gcp-hackthenorth-3042.appspot.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gcp-hackthenorth-3042.appspot.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Vent Over Tea", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vent Over Tea \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/853/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vent Over Tea \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/901/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vent Over Tea \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/937/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are students from McGill University and have noticed that McGill\u2019s mental health resources are highly inaccessible, with wait times up to four months long.

For the bar animations, we used jqmeter, a JavaScript plugin. The frontend uses bootstrap.</p>\n<p>Flow: when a user inputs text for analysis, we execute a python function to cross-reference the words in the text with a list of words that studies show appeal more to men or women. We calculate a \u201cgender bias\u201d score based on the percentage of \u201cgendered words\u201d out of the whole text. Our suggestion tool then uses a replacement algorithm to generate text with a gender bias more geared towards the female or male gender. The suggestions are rescored to ensure that an improvement has been made.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge came at the beginning of Hack the North. Initially, our team planned to build a mobile app to facilitate facebook purchases. However, we struggled to commit to the project. Though it was technically impressive and used several \u201cprize\u201d APIs, we didn\u2019t feel that it advanced social good. After we committed to building Neutralizer, our team dynamic shifted in a positive way, because we all believe in the social importance of gender diversity in the workplace.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Working on a team with 3 other people, finishing a project that has a social impact, and pivoting effectively. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to pivot between ideas very quickly. We also had a crucial \u201cteam epiphany\u201d that the point of a hackathon is to build something important, not to win prizes.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Neutralize</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re excited to release Neutralize to the public, so that people become aware of the potential biases in their everyday language. We hope that Neutralize will be widely adopted as a tool for modifying job descriptions, and become a piece of the solution to the lack of gender diversity in many industries, including tech.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.neutralizerr.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.neutralizerr.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.neutralizerr.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the python backend.", "", "", ""]], ["Cheezy Dibbles", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you ever foun</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Cheezy Dibbles</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-speech-api\">google-web-speech-api</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["pill-me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pill-me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/740/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pill-me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/743/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pill-me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/744/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pill-me \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/747/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pill-me \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/895/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The healthcare industry loses billions every year because of wrongly consumed, or forgotten pills.

After entering the pill details into the Android app, we have the user take a photo for us to perform image analysis. This allows us to figure out how many pills of each type you have and keep track of it without you having to count. We have a custom made 3d-printed box paired with an arduino and LED lights. One light will go off when it is time to consume your pill, while the other 3 LEDs will indicate which compartment to consume from. After taking the pill, you take a photo of the box, and this allows us to determine pills remaining.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For image recognition of the pill circles, we wrote our own algorithms using OpenCV and integrated it as a web API. We have an Android app as the main interface for the user. We used the Arduino to control the LEDs and it interfaces with the computer serially to get internet (we couldn't get a WiFi shield). We have a node client app on the computer that maintains a websocket connection with the server and controls the Arduino. The API server is built express.js on-top of AWS and wraps the python image recognition script. We 3d-printed our box with the design done in solidworks.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Mahimna - It has been almost a year since I touched solidworks and CAD modelling - it was a very nice refresher to be able to create the pill box with 3d printing. I also learned how to rapidly program on multiple platforms. I often switched gears from doing Arduino code and circuitry to writing the Android app.</p>\n<p>Allen - I was able to dive deep into OpenCV with the python bindings, allowing me to detect pill-shaped circles against various colours of backgrounds (red, green, and blue). I also got a good dosage of web client development.</p>\n<p>Kevin - I learned how to integrate many different components from different systems in a short period of time. I worked on the server code, built a client to help serially connect the Arduino to the server, and wrapped Allen's image recognition script into an API. It was interesting to see how the pieces came together.</p>\n<p>One thing we all learned was that working with hardware is tough and unpredictable. Half a day was spent fiddling with a Spark Core that wouldn't flash our code, so we swapped it for an Arduino.</p>\n<h2>What's next for pill-me</h2>\n<p>More robust hardware and software integration.

Users simply login to the app on their smart phones, and then tap or scan items as they take them off of the shelf. This app utilizes both near field communication (NFC) tags, as well as barcodes as a method to select items. This was done not only to benefit the customer, but also to make this application easier to implement into current stores while requiring minimal changes, and therefore additional costs, to the consumer. Once the customer is finished shopping their payment is processed with one simple touch; thus reducing lines and congestion within shopping facilities. We used Firebase as the backend of the application to store user data values as well as inventory items, and Braintree to process credit card payments. So shop with ease and use Atise!</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Time is money, and a substantial amount of time is spent each year waiting in lineups at checkouts. The inspiration for this project came about by questioning better ways to shop. It was determined that the checkout process is one of the main issues with conventional shopping methods, as both the lineups  and congestion that they created not only take a considerable amount of time for the consumer, but also lower the overall quality of one\u2019s shopping experience.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Atise is an android application that increases shopping efficiency by allowing the customer to scan items  and process payment for said items in just the click of a button.  Rather than traditional shopping methods that create a bottle neck at the checkout, this application allows customers to have a seamless shopping experience. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Atise is an android application that increases shopping efficiency by allowing the customer to scan items  and process payment for said items in just the click of a button.  Rather than traditional shopping methods that create a bottle neck at the checkout, this application allows customers to have a seamless shopping experience. We also utilized ZXing for barcode scanning and NFC libraries to read the data in the NFC tags.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into and what we learned</h2>\n<p>Despite the fact that we did face challenges throughout the process, we are very happy with the level of success that we have achieved. This has truly been a learning experience, and many of our difficulties were due to inexperience with the programs and APIs that we chose to use. However we looked upon this as a positive rather than a negative, as we were able to gain new skills and experience through these challenges.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Atise</h2>\n<p>Next steps for Atise include using GPS fencing as a method to automate payment; so once the customer leaves  the store their payment will be processed 100% automatically. Additional functions such as integrating a rewards points system, and  creating a quantity selector for adding varying amounts of items are also steps we are interested in implementing in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree\">braintree</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/davidxvuong/atise\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/davidxvuong/atise\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["C60", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vm-aPC4OVuA?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"C60 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/260/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"C60 \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/261/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"C60 \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/262/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"C60 \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/263/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"C60 \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/293/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"C60 \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/294/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"C60 \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/295/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>When the Pebble smartwatch first launched in 2013, it opened realms of possibilities for social interactions and networking. You were suddenly able to check text messages, initiate a call, and even check the weather - all without taking your phone out of your pocket. That was, and still is, amazing; however the Pebble was still missing one key feature: NFC, or Near Field Communication. Until now. At the moment, there is no other method of quick real time communication between Pebble watches for data sharing. NFC relies on a physical chip, but our solution implements the same real time communication via several devices, just without needing the specific hardware.</p>\n<p>We always enjoyed participating in social and networking events like hackathons, or even concerts. We meet tons of people with similar interests, but can\u2019t possibly talk to all of them for more than a minute or two. We wanted to change that.</p>\n<p>Enter C60. You meet someone cool at an event, but don\u2019t necessarily have time to engage in a lengthy conversation. But you want to keep in touch. Forget about getting your phone, unlocking it, going to the contacts app, and then trading information. Simply open up app on your watch, and within seconds you are connected with each other\u2019s contact information. It\u2019s a simple concept, but truly revolutionary for social interaction.</p>\n<p>C60 is simple and easy to use. You just have to make a profile on our website and download our Pebble app. Individuals within the area can be found using GPS co-ordinates that find other active users. In a matter of seconds, they can send invites and add others onto their contact lists in real time. </p>\n<p>It\u2019s that simple. Meet, greet, connect.

However, you need to get out of your place or forever be stuck in a crazed state! You notice that the light you're holding helps you back into reality for a few moments as you try to find the keys to your door and the actual entrance to leave. Sometimes you'll need both dream-world and reality world to solve the puzzles in the game.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using Unity 3D, C#, Javascript, Blender, and Arduino (+ sensors, wires, all the electronic components!)</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Implementing Arduino with Unity seamlessly. Even when I did, it slowed the game down significantly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting it to work, but more of less, \"hacking\" the controller and making it more immersive and tailored to specific games.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to implement analog sensors with Unity.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Clandestine</h2>\n<p>Adding more details and puzzles and figuring out a way to speed it up and work flawlessly (also more or less give the game a proper end-state)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

We wanted to automate the process to make it easier for small/medium retailers to use this hack to better understand their target market.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This hack allows retail owners to receive a constantly updated number of customers in their store. Using motion-tracking, we can determine the point in the day when traffic reaches it peak, when traffic is low and many other analytics. With this information pushed to an accessible, beautiful IOS app, owners can effectively organize employees' work hours. Clips also double as security footage, being uploaded to Dropbox. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Python for the back-end allows motion-tracking. Clips are uploaded to Dropbox via their API. Sketch for mockups and Swift/auto-layout for production code. Swift was also utilized for the connection with Firebase's back-end. Swift was used for the entire front end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Design from mock-up to X-Code was not exactly consistent due to auto-layout issues. Indico integration would have been amazing, but due to time restrictions, it was not an added feature. Due to our time constraints we weren't able to adapt the motion software to the extent we wanted which led us to eliminate certain features that would have assisted in analysis for retail owners. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully created a back end that allowed us to detect motion and use that information to assist businesses. We're proud of our back end, the effectiveness we achieved in such a short time period, our beautiful design and our swift front end.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Design principles, Firebase &amp; Dropbox API as well as an increased knowledge of  Swift for IOS development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Motion Map</h2>\n<p>Facial recognition with Indico in order to track customers' moods when they enter and leave the store would be a powerful addition that could prove effective in determining the stores success.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/dropbox\">dropbox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["planzz", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"planzz \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/036/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>planzz</h1>\n<p>Planzz is a student course management system designed to help students find friends in the same classes as them.

Wrist doctor wants to lower that number.</strong></h2>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><strong>Our goal was to help people that have a health deficiency/problem.</strong> Despite the fact CTS is not a major problem today, we anticipated it will be a bigger threat in the days of tomorrow as more of our world becomes engrossed in technology that we control with our bare hands. Thus, it was in light of the better of the future and desire to do social good that we decided to tackle this problem.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>Our hack is a web-app that is synced in realtime with the Leap Motion (motion detector) that scans a certain area in the domain of medium ranged hand movement and ultimately detects Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. </p>\n<h2>Wait, what is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome?</h2>\n<p>CTS is a disease in the hand that originates in your wrist; symptoms include: your hand feeling 'useless', a tingling/burning feeling, fingers feeling swollen, decreased grip strength, etc. It is caused by swelling of the median nerve, which is a nerve that runs through the palm of your hand, through your wrist, all the way up to your shoulder. <strong>Depending on the severity, you may even need surgery.</strong> You can get CTS in many ways, common ones are by making repetitive hand motions (i.e. knitting, texting), bad posture, stretching your wrist in ways it is not meant to bend it, etc. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We detect and developed certain repetitive patterns that often lead to cases of CTS and send desktop notifications to the user when motions that meet a threshold are marked as harmful. In addition to recognizing several disease inducing motions, we implemented a test to see if you are likely to have CST called the Phalein's test where you put your hands together in a particular manner - pain/tingling in the wrist over the course of a minute indicates a higher chance of having the disease. We synced the Leap Motion's real time response with the Firebase API to save the user's wrist movements and providing data visualizations of their experience. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Setting up Firebase to properly update a user's information was tricky since, at one point, it would delete all of the user's information except for the information required to update - that was a problem. This issue came back to haunt us again when we were sending back the user's movements and running a matching algorithm to see which harmful motions have the highest correlation.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>We really enjoyed creating a product that helps those that are less unfortunate than us.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Flask : set up a RESTful API and did some routing, core backend</p></li>\n<li><p>Firebase: we used this API to sync the Leap Motion with the database to provide real time updates and store relevant notification information</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Wrist Doctor</h2>\n<p>There are many things we can do to improve our application. A few things we can do is add more gestures that can be recognized as harmful, making the regression algorithm more accurate and predictive, and supporting multiple platforms such as mobile so the application can be extended to those in the workforce.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/david-hong/htn2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/david-hong/htn2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote the Flask backend, designed and implemented notification based data visualizations, and created custom motion gestures considered harmful and/or cause CTS.", ""]], ["HackTheNorth2015", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>HackTheNorth2015 - It Shakes One to Know One</h1>\n<p>We've built an pebble/iPhone application that allows two people who have shaken hands while wearing the Pebble watch to get quick access to each other's Facebook profiles, allowing people to connect on social networks faster and easier. The application uses Pebble APIs to access accelerometer data which is used to analyze handshake gestures. We also use the Pebble API to communicate with the iPhone via App Message. After the accelerometer data is sent to the iPhone, it is analyzed with time stamps to confirm that two people have actually shaken hands. After the confirmation, we send the FBID, a universal identifier for the Facebook user to a Firebase server, where the IDs can be fetched by both people who has shaken hands.

This is a sad fact as tremendous amount of money is being wasted for ineffective advertising. For this reason, we decided to create Spegill - an interactive web application capable to remembering aspects of user's life by having simple verbal conversation and advanced facial recognition algorithms. Using Indico, Wit.ai and Face++'s API along with Flask and node.js, we aspired and have created an intuitive AI with machine learning. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Spegill is capable to determining a user's characteristics and preferences using machine-learning. As well, it is capable of remembering each user based on facial recognition without the need to register or authenticate. The web app is able to determine and record all sorts of data about the user's preference without the need of typing anything at all. This enables Spegill to show relevant advertisement on the fly as user walks by a Spegill enabled banner. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used node.js and Flask as our major frameworks. We also reversed-engineer Wit.ai's Javascript SDK to receive raw information we later incorporated into our app. We used APIs from Indico, Face++ and Wit.ai.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>We attempted to work with Azure Machine Learning's Face API at first but we failed to get it to work in the end. We also ran into many issues trying to get the facial recognition to work the second time when users come back.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>We created an AI that is very similar to those of many large companies in a effective manner. We were also thrilled about having the AI being capable to recognizing people multiple times and having input directly through voice.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We learned more about the various API we used as well as Azure Machine Learning's Face API. Personally, I finally had the chance to work with Flask and Python with the help of my team members. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Spegill</h2>\n<p>We plan to integrate a full advertisement system that will effectively choose interesting ads for each user. We hope to make the interface completely hands free in the future as well with more fluid interactions. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Cydrobolt/spegill\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Cydrobolt/spegill\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Python, Linux", "", ""]], ["Ordr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/playlist?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We don't like waiting in line and recognize the gains that could be realized through less time interacting with the user.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows people to order for themselves through their smartphone and pay.

Looking to make easy money by helping others with tech problems? Well now, you have WhizBridge. </p>\n<p>WhizBridge is an integrated <strong>buyer centric marketplace</strong> for the safe purchase and distribution of IT services from local \"Whizzes\". This app connects people with technical problems with certified local tech support Whizzes. The service operates on a transaction-by-transaction basis, with no requirement for customer registration. Services can be requested through a web service, an iOS app, or via SMS. All payment is handled through the Braintree API.</p>\n<p>The client can submit a request for a Whiz through our webpage, SMS or through the iOS app. After submitting the request, we will extract the cost of the job from the client's account - acting as the middleman of the transaction. Each Whiz will receive a list of jobs, including a price and the technical problem, and can choose to accept a job. After accepting the job, the Whiz will travel to the location of the client, and assist the client in solving the the problem. When both parties are agreed that the service has been provided, payment will be transferred to the Whiz.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>WhizBridge was built using a PHP and MySQL backend connected to an HTML/Javascript based front-end. Twilio was integrated to provide support for text messaging, and Braintree was used to process payments. Google Maps API was used to locate the clients through their addresses, and to provide a map UI for the Whizzes when they choose to take on a job.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>iOS is difficult to design in. Swift is difficult to use. Apache servers are spawns of satan. Many members of the team were new to PHP. </p>\n<p>Braintree API was the primary method of transferring funds for WhizBridge, but it proved too difficult to use.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The website's backend is functional, including its capability in locating a client through the address provided. Furthermore, the team was able to effectively use Twilio to give users more flexibility in how they post jobs, accept jobs, and complete jobs.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it is possible to learn PHP in the span of 36 hours, and to create a functional website from no experience that works decently. We also learned that not all webservers are made equal.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WhizBridge</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow different types of payment, using APIs other than Braintree</li>\n<li>Implement an algorithm that matches Whizzes to problems that are best suited for them</li>\n<li>Display jobs that are close to Whizzes, not all jobs at once.</li>\n<li>Add a system of verification for Whiz certification</li>\n<li>Use an algorithm that determines the difficulty of a problem, to determine the suggested price that a client should pay for each job.</li>\n<li>Implement a rating system that allows clients to rate Whizzes on how effective they were at solving the problem.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/georgeutsin/WhizBridge\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/georgeutsin/WhizBridge\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the wireframe of the backend (custom PHP MVC framework), created the iOS app, helped out a lot with the front end and back end, and did a bit of design.", "I worked on the front-end, and implemented APIs.

We also used Express.JS(via Node.JS) for our backend infrastructure to serve our iOS app's Indico needs, and also handle other calls. We also used HTML,CSS, and more JS(jquery, etc.) to develop our front-end web application.  We hosted our backend on Google Cloud and consumed the Facebook and Indico APIs. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into challenges in everything from buggy iOS UI threads that needed to be discovered, learning how local mongodb servers work, and especially when we continued to deploy express.js code(after multiple attempts) to serve our iOS app's needs correctly. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of everything from quick iterations on the iOS side of things to collaborations, changes, and knowledge attained through the entire development process. Most particularly, the Indico API did not have a modern, correctly working iOS SDK, so we developed a node.js application to take care of our Indico API needs.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how accessible very complex areas of computer science can be as a result of APIs that make anything possible. I also learned how confusing it can be when large companies roll out buggy SDKs, which end up leading to old posts dominating forums, which ends up not helping me solve problems quickly. Also, our knowledge of web development via full stack JS, cloud deployment(Google Cloud), and iOS grew a lot!  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Post Politics</h2>\n<p>If well received, up next is twitter integration since people tend to post more rapidly on Twitter(thus the data is more valuable with regards to showing political preferences).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hackthenorth2015.appspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hackthenorth2015.appspot.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackthenorth2015.appspot.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/snaheth/FBIndico\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/snaheth/FBIndico\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Developed the entire iOS application and worked with the Indico API on the backend.", ""]], ["carecam", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/139843255?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"carecam \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/676/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"carecam \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/685/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"carecam \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/686/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"carecam \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/687/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"carecam \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/688/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Carecam</h1>\n<p>The daycare industry is notorious for being unreliable and underfunded. Horror stories of children being neglected or left in unsafe environments are common. In response, parents have been pressuring daycares to install monitoring cameras so that they can check in on their child - and their caregiver - throughout the day.</p>\n<p>The problem, however, is that monitoring systems are expensive and often require expertise to set up. So, I created Carecam.</p>\n<p>Carecam is a simple, affordable, subscription-based software service that turns the webcam(s) of your home computer into a secure monitoring system for your home daycare. All you need to do is sign up, turn on your webcam, and give parents access - that's it.</p>\n<p>Carecam is a business idea I've had for some time now, and I am happy to have started it at Hack the North.

Coordinating this can sometimes be challenging. For example, in the past year, \"here Lorenzo\" turned into \"Goals Lore Zo\" and \"coming for you Kieran\" turned into \"coming for us Kerry\". We wanted a solution that was automatic and would alert us of where we were, and what was going on, without having to lift a finger.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Diamond Lane is a hands off communication platform for existing, recurring carpools. It allows you to register with a carpool (or create one and invite others) and receive notifications when carpool-related events occur. For example, on a carpool day, a driver will be notified through a push notification. This driver will be chosen based on the past history of who has driven. Once the driver leaves their house, a notification will be sent to everyone involved in the carpool. At this time, if they open the app, they can see everyone's location in real time. Finally, as the driver begins to pick people up, notifications are dispatched so everyone is in the loop until ultimately everyone has been accounted for.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We initially started with setting up a database and server component on Amazon's EC2 cloud platform. From there, we integrated the API into our application and created the interface. Our application was written using native Objective-C.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We did not anticipate how many edge cases were involved through coordinating carpools. Although our app worked with the major use cases, we encountered difficulty when trying to figure out how to account for changes in pickup locations among other events. We also struggled to find a system to notify the driver and maintain that state throughout multiple applications.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're really stoked to have been able to build and provision a server entirely from scratch, build a full scale API and database layer, and ultimately a reasonably well featured front end application in just 36 hours. With more polish, it's reasonable that the application could be </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Working as a team and iterating quickly is difficult.

Ideal for use on college campuses and tight-knit local communities. </p>\n<p><strong>What it does</strong></p>\n<p>Evently allows users to quickly and intuitively discover and create public events in their area, which are displayed as markers on a map. Upon opening the app, the map is set to the user\u2019s location and immediately populated with local events that are happening today.

In addition, users will be able to create groups and invite certain groups to their events so not all their friends are able to see every event they create. With the authentication, we can have an attendees list as well so users can accept or decline event invitations and see who else is going to an event.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lucyyu24/Evently\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lucyyu24/Evently\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Floppy Cups", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We found way too many floppy drives and upon remembering how useless they are, we decided to make an orchestra out of them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It plays midi files out of floppy drives.

This application is protected by an NFC card (for example: expired or active credit card), which makes it an inexpensive but effective password vault.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It safely keeps different passwords at one place and provides a single click launch from the mobile app. First, the user need to register on the application by providing a username, pin and a tap of any NFC card.

Exhausted, you desperately try to find a way to stay awake for this midterm review session. coffee? Red bull? Have the person sitting beside you wake you up when you fall asleep?\nBut what if you are one of those people who find energy drink too unhealthy to have and coffee too bitter to swallow and the people sitting beside you just don\u2019t care enough to help?\nFor that, our team developed a simple solution to help students. We created an app that will change your lecture experience and allow you to spend your time more effectively \u2013 staying awake in class instead of spending extra time studying at home.</p>\n<p>The app works like this:\nWhen you launch the app, the interface, coded in java, asks you for your carrier information then starts the Matlab remote control session. The webcam starts and the image processing algorithm will identify and track if your eye balls are visible.\nIf the pupils are not seen for a period of time, the app will send a text message via wifi and attempt to wake you up with phone vibration or notification. If your eyes don\u2019t open within the next few seconds, your phone will continue to shake you from your dreams.\nCurrently in the market, there are products for waking drivers up like ear pieces that vibrates when the algorithm detects the driver is risk of accident. However, the scenario is not quite transferable in the classroom. Therefore, WuzzUP is the best solution because it utilizes what students already have. Wuzzup is simple and reliable.

We used its matchbox recommender system (that is a hybrid recommender system which uses both collaborative-based filtering and content-based filtering) and trained it using our dataset scraped from allrecipes.com, and then deployed it as a web service.</p>\n<p><strong>Glossary</strong>:</p>\n<p><em>Collaborative-based filtering</em> - Based on other user's data on the list of recipes, Azure creates a sparse matrix and uses matrix operations in order to determine a rough recommendation set for the current user</p>\n<p><em>Content-based Filtering</em> - Based on the user's metadata (e.g. if she was a university student or really liked Chinese food), this user's \"content\" will affect the recommendation. This is really good if the user has never rated any other recipe in the dataset beforehand, so we can prevent the \"cold-start\" problem.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>On the backend, there is a documented bug on the Azure machine learning platform where any experiment with the matchbox recommender system module cannot be deployed as a web service (and this bug was LITERALLY documented two days ago...). We then switched to Django to store all of our data and calculated the cosine distances between each vector (vector in this case, is each recipe) to implement the machine learning aspect of it. In the end, the two backend developers did not have any experience with making an API however, so ultimately, as time ran out, we finally decided that our iOS client app needed to host the data locally on the iOS just for the purposes of demonstration. Because our complete dataset is over 50,000 recipes, we gave the iOS a subset of our dataset as 50,000 recipes takes a long time to load especially on a mobile device.</p>\n<p>On the frontend, in the beginning, workflow was blocked because only one person could work on a storyboard at a time, even though there were two people. Afterwards, using the core data (iOS's local database) was a bit of a challenge as the iOS developers did not have any experience with it. They also never made a RESTAPI client, but fortunately we finally solved all of these issues. However, time was running out, so not all of the features were able to be finished. The UI isn't up to par as we wanted it to be, and some unfinished features include: the master/detail view of the recipes and each of their details, the shopping list that collected all of the user's recipes' ingredients they wanted to cook for the week and listed them in a checkbox format, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>LINKS</strong>:</p>\n<p>Link to the documented bug in the matchbox recommender module:\n<a href=\"https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/288e6914-084b-479a-9c95-f2ccae58ca14/score-model-error-0082-on-predictive-experiment?forum=MachineLearning\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/288e6914-084b-479a-9c95-f2ccae58ca14/score-model-error-0082-on-predictive-experiment?forum=MachineLearning</a></p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're Proud of, and What We've Learned</h2>\n<p>The frontend developers had extremely clean and modular code for a hackathon. They spent a lot of time not getting messy, and doing many mockups and design before actually coding the project. They also learnt a lot (which was listed in the \"challenges we've faced\" section).</p>\n<p>The backend developers learned a lot about machine learning and recommender systems as well. We learned some algorithms on how to implement recommender systems (e.g. hybrid collaborative-based and content-based filtering, but also cosine distance functions). We also learned a very important thing that all good data scientists do: which was to CORRECTLY format the dataset and its subsequent features/columns so that it can be inputted into the machine learning experiment correctly. This included categorizing many features (5000+ potentially) down to 10 features, which makes the machine learning part go faster. This also included cleaning the dataset, and knowing how to clean the dataset in this particular context.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SmartChef</h2>\n<p>We want to improve the UI, finish the backend API, and finish more of the features for the iOS client app. We mostly wanted to make this app to learn more about machine learning and how to implement the client-server system, and we are really proud of how much we learned even though no one knew how to do all of this beforehand! :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pliu037/HtN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pliu037/HtN\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pliu037/HtN-Analytics\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pliu037/HtN-Analytics\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/uteschiehlen/foodhero.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/uteschiehlen/foodhero.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the iOS App, as a front-end to display the recommended recipes and to provide the back-end with user information.

The seeker, Mark Suan,  would send out a text to Theo Stone, Teo Voinea and Tim Odd occasionally asking if he was \"hotter\" or \"cooler\". This added dimension of utilizing smart phones to enhance the Hide and Seek experience inspired the four individuals to step up their idea to a full fledged app thus giving rise to \"Hide &amp; Hunt\".</p>\n<p>\"Hide and Hunt\" is app based game which combines childhood classics, Hide and Seek and Man Hunt, into one while tweaking a few rules here and there. \"Seeker\" can place various checkpoints on the app map, which \"Hiders\" must reach before they are considered home free.</p>\n<p>Using smart phone capabilities and GPS tracking, new dynamics and dimension  has been added to user game play. GPS location services provide general proximity locations of all players, and exact locations of the checkpoints. GPS location services via a Google Maps API is taken advantage of to track relative velocities of players. If players remain stagnant too long, Seekers receive a signal/notification of the users location. This is to ensure that \"Hide and Hunt\" remains dynamic and the game is able to progress.</p>\n<p>Utilizing firebase's database, an Android SDK was used to develop the front end app design layout, node JS to handle the server back-end, development of each segment was fairly straightforward.</p>\n<p>Challenges we unfortunately ran into implementation problems with Google Maps API breaking down altogether and http requests were not getting through to our server. Despite the lack of a finished developed product, I was extremely proud of my teams individual in their respective segments of the app. More so, the ingenuity and creativity of the idea is something I am truly proud of. Despite everything which has happened I realized implementation and uniform documentation is crucial. Hide and Hunt will most definitely be developed further with more user capabilities and game  customization to meet users unique needs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Theo-Stone/HideAndSeek\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Theo-Stone/HideAndSeek\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Astro", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Astro \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/479/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Astro \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/480/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Astro \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/481/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The idea behind this started after reading <em>The Martian</em>, and thinking that a survival game based around a similar premise would be pretty cool.

The firebase API was also used as the main server and database. </p>\n<p>For the hardware component, we used an accelerometer in order to determine the user\u2019s sleep patterns and when they move during their sleep.

Instead, the bulk of our application is written in node, with a smaller contingent in Pebble.js. We use WebSockets to communicate between the Pebble and the server, in a manner reminiscent of publish-subscribe services. The bulk of the processing is done on the server, with the client being rather thin.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The number one challenge we ran into involved expecting the Pebble to be able to render an invalid PNG. Fail. That particular issue sucked multiple hours, although we eventually fixed it by running the PNGs through an image editor and multiple formats.

draw our inspiration from 3 different sources:\n1) Even though electric transport vehicles exist, the low amount of them in this world means we need to increase the ways we travel green. Carpooling or ridesharing has been one such alternative, however ridesharing for the most part is still done on gas-guzzling cars. \n2) Motorbikes aren't the only light transportation vehicle out there, motorboats and motorgliders are also out there. We're not just about getting you from Point A to B, we're more about the thrill of the ride, providing you with an unforgettable journey, and helping you travel in unconventionally idiosyncratic methods.\n3) The Three Comma Club from Silicon Valley</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Ridesharing, taken to the next level - to the 3 Comma Club, the realm where the unicorns and narwhals thrive...

Just in 2015 some notable ones were in Nepal in April and Chile in September, while in some places such as Japan major earthquakes are pretty frequent. We were personally inspired to create this app as our families were affected by the Nepal Quake and one of the major problem of the aftermath was communication and information on earthquake magnitude and location in close to real-time. \nWe based this app on pebble watches, to allow people to quickly receive news on their watch and respond with a single shake triggered response menu.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This app pushes data from a reliable earthquake data website: <a href=\"http://earthquake.usgs.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://earthquake.usgs.gov</a>. Then it displays the latest information for a certain selected location to the user on the pebble watch. With a single shake motion after receiving this message, the user can update his loved ones with his quick status. As well as receive updates from loved ones through built-in supporting app platforms such as email, sms, google hangouts and facebook.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This was our first experience developing an app for pebble and also learning and using JavaScript. We referred guides at <a href=\"http://developer.getpebble.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://developer.getpebble.com</a> to get started. We used cloudpebble to build the watchface and watchapp. We pushed data from websites and displayed selected ones on the screen. We then allow use the  watch's Accelerometer information that detect a shake/jerk by the user. This shake/jerk triggers a quick response menu to show up allowing the user to respond to loved ones with a quick status update message sent via the supporting apps linked with pebble.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was an extremely new platform as well as language we had to learn from scratch.\nDebugging was difficult using cloudpebble and we hope this can be improved in the future.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning basic javascript and being able to start with a super cool project using pebble watches. Getting a chance to create an app for Pebble that has is highly useful for earthquakes and natural disasters based relief support and safety updates. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Javascript, Pebble Development, etc</p>\n<h2>What's next for Quake Alert Pebble App</h2>\n<p>Integrating with direct status update to facebook. \nAdding and a regular background ping whenever movement is detected in the user. The background ping  showing location and cumulative movement information can be allowed to be requested by loved ( preselected) on an hourly update basis and it can run in the background without requiring user input. If an emergency situation such as being trapped in rubble in earthquake arises, less movement will be detected and loved ones will receive a ping showing that and will be able to respond quickly to rescue. Even though our prototype is based on earthquake, this can be customized for other natural disasters that require information dissemination, status response and safety pings.</p>\n</div>\n<div

The client-side fully utilizes various features of HTML5 and provides a bridge to the game play implemented using an emerging WebGL technology.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Working on the project, we had to optimize the fetching of the data from remote APIs as well as the use of 3D animations inside the browser. To improve the user experience and prevent unnecessary delays in the application's workflow, we had to reduce the number of requests and utilize some of the classic computer algorithms.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team is proud of the project we completed and the challenges we had to overcome.

You can increase the track speed up to 3.0x, fast forward/backward your playlist, add a new set of beats of your own, crossfade two distinct tracks, imitate record scratching and even 'drop the bass'!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Used openFrameworks for graphics and audio, Leap SDK for raw data and c++ for general coding.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had to understand how DJing works to create the closest thing to real DJ equipments, but also remove the technology barrier users may face. Therefore we generated various hand gestures using raw data from LeapMotion for more friendly user interface. Getting the precision of hand motions right was the biggest issue because the slightest mis-movement would result in a whole different action and mess your track up.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of everything that my team has completed up to the final moment and the fact that we were able to produce a fairly high-quality program.</p>\n<h2>What's next for DJ Leap</h2>\n<p>We are hoping to have a sync feature where we can sync two songs with different bpms so they will sound even more natural and amazing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/calvinjhchan/DJLeap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/calvinjhchan/DJLeap\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["LoSocco", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3-RnvmDsZ8?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>E-Commerce Doesn't Work for Small Businesses</h2>\n<p>Small businesses keep being told they need to be online to be successful. But when they try, they end up spending thousands of dollars on expensive e-commerce websites. No potential customers ever find the site because topping Google Search rankings is nearly impossible.</p>\n<h2>Local Shopping, Online</h2>\n<p>On Losocco, small business owners post their products without having to pay thousands to web developers. Customers find all the products they'd find on Amazon, but without expensive shipping costs and with the added value of growing the local economy.</p>\n<h2>Power in Numbers</h2>\n<p>Aggregate product listings filtered by location make it easier for small businesses to find new customers online. Uber style mutual ratings upon transactions holds sellers accountable so buyers can be confident and not scared of becoming the next Kijiji or Craigslist horror story. Losocco is where you can confidently shop for local products online.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our team has done web development for small business owners in different industries and realized many of them have the same problem. Even if we do all we can, their new websites rarely change their bottom line revenue. </p>\n<h2>Losocco</h2>\n<p>Losocco solves discovery problems for e-commerce websites. Losocco is a more inviting buying experience than Kijiji and Craigslist. Losocco gives small businesses the opportunity to take back their destiny from Amazon and Walmart.</p>\n<h2>Video Demo</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/a3-RnvmDsZ8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/a3-RnvmDsZ8</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coinbase\">coinbase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/paypal\">paypal</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://losoc.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://losoc.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>losoc.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["The Realest", "swag", "", ""]], ["Hardware Launchpad", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hardware Launchpad \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/192/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hardware Launchpad \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/406/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hardware Launchpad \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/433/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The two hacking organizations on the University of Michigan's campus - MHacks and Michigan Hackers - have a large amount of hardware that's accumulated over the years. The problem is that the hardware comes out for major events, and then just <em>stays</em> in storage for the majority of the year. We think some sort of system to manage renting out this hardware during the year to hackers at Michigan would be invaluable for our hacker community.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The list of available and taken inventory is publicly viewable for anyone to see at anytime. After registering, users can add a credit card (to ensure that users can be charged in the case where they do not return their hardware) and then check out hardware with administrator approval. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We all had a little bit of Rails experience with different levels of the stack, so we started working on various parts in line with our strengths and weaknesses. First came a backend to handle user accounts (while design was worked on concurrently), then hardware, then routing and general page design before adding Braintree API integration to handle our customers' credit card information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We struggled using the Braintree API (having started it with only a little amount of time left in the hackathon), as well as general source control with three people working on the project (we stopped using branches in our GitHub repository early on, which was a poor choice).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The design is kickass, the basics of the Braintree API implementation are there, and we think this hack has a lot of potential to help a lot of cool hacks be created at Michigan between our local hackathons and events.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We further learned and practiced our limited Rails experience and API implementation skills, while thinking broadly about the issues and possibilities facing our hardware hackers at Michigan.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hackathon Launchpad</h2>\n<p>There's a bit more spit and polish required - especially around supporting administrator actions like viewing loans and where hardware is at any one time, which was originally scoped but we ran out of time for. After bringing our Braintree API account to production, we'd like to investigate integrating the NFC cards from MHacks 6 as a way to identify and login users with a simple card swipe. Then, we think we can go live with this to the hacker community at Michigan.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree\">braintree</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/preetsmohan/hardware-launchpad\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/preetsmohan/hardware-launchpad\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I really enjoyed using this opportunity to work with Ruby on Rails!

Does this for the whole mix and logs the tuples of the found track's name and start time within the mix.  Then it displays this information for the user on a webpage so they can get jamming!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>First we looked into how to compare .mp3 files.  Using an obscure API, we were able to find out that our iterating and comparing algorithm would be feasible by comparing 10 second slices of the stream to existing signatures in our database.  Then we built a back end in Flask that would process requests.  These requests would be in the form of the URL of the Soundcloud track.  After getting the request and algorithm settled we started on displaying this  information for the user.  We then built a simple webpage that would display the titles and start times.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>At first the team was set on a different hack that we spent hours trying to wrap our heads around, that is, compress a file within slices of PI using the BBP hex algorithm for calculating the Nth digit of PI.  However, no matter what implementation we used, it would just get bigger instead of smaller.  So we pivoted to a different idea.</p>\n<p>The second challenge we ran into was that our plan to inject buttons to skip within the Soundcloud page's Html was not doable by anybody on our team with our remaining time.  So instead we focused on communicating the information through a separate webpage for the user to discern on their own accord.</p>\n<p>Our last challenge came during testing.  We would throw songs at the database that are very popular, expecting accurate results, but in a lot of cases we end up with obscure field recordings of Chinese farmers.  We could not pivot by switching databases as that would change our whole central algorithmic processing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning thorough hex code and its decimal conversion.\nLearning BBP algorithms for calculating irrational numbers\nLearning some CSS, Html, and Javascript\nDoing successful file operations\nMade an API (1st time!)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Understanding .mp3 files and their fingerprints\nHow Soundcloud processes API requests\nCollatz theorem\nHow hexadecimal is interpreted and converted</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pure Fire</h2>\n<p>Building Chrome + Firefox extensions to inject Html into the Soundcloud page to allow users to skip forward and back between songs within the large mix\nPerfecting that #fire mixtape</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">acrcloud</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ColdSauce/Pure-Fire\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ColdSauce/Pure-Fire\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Hype Social", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hype Social \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/530/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hype Social \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/570/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We're upper year uWaterloo students that love being involved with campus. We know first hand that there's usually too much going on or too little at any given moment--Hype Social helps you find the experiences and communities of people you're passionate about.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for Hype Social came from a simple premise: we're all apart of communities in one way or another, but it's hard to know what's happening! There are so many opportunities to meet people, grow and have fun all around us, but a lot of it gets lost in the noise. Amazing people are putting hard work in to make wonderful events, and amazing people are missing out. We set out to make a platform for communities to feel more connected, and make it easy to find events that are perfect for what you want to do.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hype Social is a platform that helps you connect with your community. In the app, it's easy to find and create communities and events that are trending and relevant to you! </p>\n<p>It's simple: you join or make some communities (ex. Hack the North, Waterloo Foodies, your close friend group), vote what you like, and we'll take notes for next time so you always find things you like! Add events, participate and become an influence in your communities. Connect with people and enjoy yourself!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>With sweat, giggles, and soylent! As far as technology goes, we used Ionic and Cordova to build the app, and Parse as the backend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Facebook's API integration with Parse and Ionic had a frustratingly show-stopping bug, so we couldn't leverage existing friends and interests to jumpstart event discovery--we were quick to hack up something else to keep going!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of the laughs and good work we've gotten to enjoy together. It's heartwarming that a project to help people find worthwhile experiences was an extremely fun and rewarding experience itself.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a bunch of new technical skills, but even more awesome was the experience of taking an idea all the way through with a newly formed team. We realized that even polished dev tools (even one's in the same ecosystem), aren't always reliable, and that was a fun challenge.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hype Social</h2>\n<p>Besides sleep, we're looking forward to having the opportunity to make a polished, complete version of our vision. Hype Social was always going to be an open platform, so we're excited to expand it to the open web too! Hype Social is something that came from a need in our everyday lives, and we're excited to get it ready, shipped and use it to hype up communities everywhere!</p>\n<h2>Team Members</h2>\n<p>Sanchit Gera,\nGuile Domingo,\nAmeesha Isaac,\nAlexander Mistakidis,\nCarter Minshull</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I designed the layout for the app. As the UX/UI Designer, I prepared by doing research on possible designs and how our users were to navigate through whatever we chose to create.

We also wanted to give pebble and android users an edge when it comes to finding attractive people.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hottie Alert is a pebble and android app. On a regular basis users receive a non-intrusive notification simply asking for them to look around and report if they see anybody attractive in the area. Their answer, yes or no, is then sent along with their location to our servers to create a map of the regions where attractive people are spotted the most. Users can then check out this map any time they're interested in spotting some hotties.\nThe most interesting aspect of this application is the crowd-sourcing affect, which will promote a healthy balance among users of a range of \"interests\" and create the definition of a \"hot spot\" as a zone where people whom the average user will find attractive tend to be.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We created the pebble and android apps using the native C and Android SDKs. Each of these apps are very simplistic in nature, only requiring the user to specify their sexual interest, and then occasionally report whether they are in a hot spot or a not spot.\nThe back end is managed as a firebase module. This allows us to easily use their RESTful API from the Pebble and Android app to record simple JSON objects containing a user's preferences, their location, and whether they spotted a hottie. This allows us to record the data, but we did not get to actually processing any of it.\nWe also created a web front end to allow the users to access the data anywhere, and see where the hot spots are. We intended to show the hot spots on a Google Map, but due to time and knowledge restrictions, the website currently depicts a hard-coded set of hot spots, to demonstrate the end result</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into problems trying to implement FireBase as our backend. For a while it prevented us from continuing with development, as the web front end was waiting for data from the back end and our mobile applications needed to post their data to the back end. In the end, we were able to implement data storage with FireBase, but did not manage to complete any processing of the data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of helping my team get this app mostly done, and having the front end fully completed.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot in developing an android and pebble application, as well as various methods of accessing a back end and the resources available to us.\nWe also developed team skills and experience with a larger project in which the different components begin to interact with each other and how everything quickly becomes dependent on other pieces.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hottie Alert</h2>\n<p>Continued development <a href=\"https://github.com/joseph-roque/htn-hottie\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>\nFixing the backend is our top priority. \n<a href=\"https://github.com/joseph-roque/htn-hottie\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/joseph-roque/htn-hottie</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hottiealert.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hottiealert.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hottiealert.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the web front end.", "I created the pebble app and did general tasks throughout the development of the project", "I worked on the android app, designing and creating it from scratch.", ""]], ["\u00dc>Clicker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"\u00dc&gt;Clicker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/109/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"\u00dc&gt;Clicker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/162/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"\u00dc&gt;Clicker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/163/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"\u00dc&gt;Clicker \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/164/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"\u00dc&gt;Clicker \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/165/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"\u00dc&gt;Clicker \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/166/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It's common knowledge that university students are short on cash. So why do they continue to charge us exorbitant amounts for things like i&gt;Clickers required for our grades? $40 for a remote control you can only use in the classroom is absurd. It's time to fight back, \u00dc deserve more.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The \u00dc&gt;Clicker does exactly what an i&gt;Clicker can do, but more. At a fraction of the cost, you can ace your class; without breaking the bank. Not only does it allow you to answer the in-class questions, it also gives you the power read minds; or other people's answers that is! It allows you to see a live feed of everyone else's answers, so you can choose the answer that most people are choosing. You can also choose for the entire class, and randomize everyone else's answers! </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>On the hardware end, we used two Arduino Unos and radio frequency receivers and transmitters. One as the receiver, and another as the transmitter, which is connected to an Android phone. The two Arduinos are coded using the Arduino IDE and NetBeans and the Android app which communicates with the Arduino through USB connection is developed using Android Studio.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We didn't have direct access to an i&gt;Clicker and base, so we found incomplete third party research and extrapolated the data in order to create a superior device. Additionally, there were hardware and power limitations with the Arduino and the RF transmitters and receivers that hindered our progress. Additionally, we had a lot of difficulty getting the firmware and program to work, especially on the topic of communications.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Simply being able to get everything working is one of the greatest feelings in the world. Especially after 36 hours of coding, having that code compile is an amazing thing. I'm also very proud of my team, because we are mostly hardware based, but we managed to pull through a lot of the software hurdles that we faced and learned a lot on the way.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Aside from sharpening my technical skills, and writing my first Android app (YAY!), I think being able to push through 36 hours with a mere 3 hours of sleep taught me that you can do anything if you set your mind to it. Although it may not be the healthiest thing, this Hackathon has showed me the potential everyone has if they set their mind to it. Not to mention, I also learned that Hack the North is one of the best hackathons ever! Thank you for an incredible experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for \u00dc&gt;Clicker</h2>\n<p>The next step is figuring out how to take over the baseband of the phone so you can transmit without any additional hardware. There is also limitless functionally that can be unleashed with \u00dc&gt;Clicker that the student can tap into.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/netbeans\">netbeans</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rf</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">java-rxtx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bkcheung/-Clicker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bkcheung/-Clicker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://millingab.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://millingab.github.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>millingab.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["SmartMeds", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/240/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/241/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/242/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/243/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/244/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/245/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/248/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SmartMeds \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/394/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The elderly often fall sick or obtain worsen syndromes from forgetting to take their medicine on time.

Smart watches work nicely with the elderly since they are familiar with the idea of wearing watches. These watches will effectively remind them to take their medicine on time. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SmartMeds allow doctors to enter in the prescription for each patient online. Thanks to Firebase, the doctor has the freedom to adjust the prescription at any time and it would be updated on the patient's end of the UI. The smart watch of our choice, pebble, is connected to our android app, which syncs with the website. The doctor enters data such as the prescription dosage, medicine name, medicine production company name, dosage start time, period interval length and the total number of times the patient needs to take the medicine.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This was built with Android Studio for the Android app; JavaScript for the Pebble app; JavaScript (AngularJS), HTML, CSS for the website;  PHP, MVC and Laravel for the backend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge we ran into was getting all the apps and website to interact with each other.

The idea was to find a way to sustain, control, and manipulate organic light created by bio-luminescent organisms and apply the principles to off-grid chemical lighting.</p>\n<p>The more research we did, the more the scope of this project was revealed. We discovered many real-world applications for our initial idea, but as the hackathon progressed we realized that we would have to pivot our project to stay within the given timeline. Our final product is a simple showcase of very complex bio-luminescence at work outside of its normal environment. </p>\n<p>The team spent a ridiculous amount of hours before the event working to gain access to a laboratory on campus for the weekend. We tested, manipulated, and explored a protein called GFP, researching its properties and creating new applications for the chemical. The team also jumped head-first into using a Raspberry Pi, Leap Motion Controller, and some other hardware without any prior experience-- it was tough to get started, but was an awesome learning opportunity for each of us.</p>\n<p>Being completely new to the tools we were working with caused quite a few issues, where we were learning to use hardware from scratch, or completely clueless as to how to program something. In the lab, restrictions placed on what we could test because of how much protein we had led us to keep downsizing ideas for the scope of this event. To create our more promising applications, we'd need much more time in the lab with more resources to learn from.</p>\n<p>As a team, we are all proud to have been part of a hack that is completely different from the rest, showing that hackathons don't only apply to programming and software.</p>\n<p>We each learned valuable skills, but more importantly were taught from experience not to be over-optimistic about the easiness of a task.</p>\n<p>Next, we're planning on either exploring our research with more detail since we've had a huge amount of support and inquiry from professors and others on the topic; we may also try something completely new, just to see what comes of it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on developing the python script to interface the raspberry pi with the lighting system.

Merced is in the central valley of California and is near many large state and federal prisons with many exiting convicts relocating to the area around it. Crimes are disproportionately high in this sparsely populated area as well as high unemployment especially to former felons. \nWe believe that education is the best way to reduce poverty and crime and wanted to build a tool that would assist in lowering recidivism rates in the United States. We decided that  providing parolees with a direct connection to employers as well as providing employers with the best information about parolees would hasten the hiring process and thus lowering crime in the United States.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The product is split into three parts, one a very rudimentary platform for prisons to enter parolee inmates participating in the platform. The second part is a education and job search tool for parolees. This part of our project is the most complete and includes prebuilt interactive courses for our parolees to take. These courses will be used to generate a profile that can be searched for by companies (the third portion of our platform).</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Node, lots of node.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The project was perhaps too large for our group to handle during a hackathon. We instead decided to focus on the learning aspect and the experience/job placement algorithm on the parolee side and restrict ourselves from focusing too much on the employer side vs end user.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Completing the project to the best of our abilities in a fulfilling manner. Creating an idea in code that can legitimately create large social impact. Staying up to code vs sleeping to better humanity.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>As a group we learned how to work more effectively as a team, how to divide tasks to finish software development faster, and we improved our skills in Node.js, HTML5, and CSS.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Prefect</h2>\n<p>Hopefully Prefect will develop in a large way to an extent where we successfully implement ourselves into a prison system. We intend on attempting to start near Shubham's university and continue from there. We are also looking for support from anyone who has the ability to create an impact in the development, progression, or funding of this project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.prefectsystems.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.prefectsystems.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.prefectsystems.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end and the content of the pages.", "", ""]], ["Shopping List", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shopping List \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/065/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The app was inspired by deals hunters.

All the user has to do it enter what products they are willing to purchase in the easy to use interface. The will look at all the locations that offer the product and responds with the best place to purchase all the necessary items. Navigating through the interface you can find further detail about how much money you are saving and how much you need to spend. </p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We designed the back end of the app by using a apache2 server with php to text rake the embedded html/json/js code in each of the online stores flyers. We took this data and ran it though a special nested array parser and output this sorted organized data into a .csv file that was sent to a google cloud sql database where the csv was stored into a mysql database. The front end of this app was developed in Android Studio (java), we focused on a clean simple design to display our data. We also developed an auto suggest feature to help the user select the products in a more convenient fashion. This java development front end utilized an extensive use of get and push requests to a remote google server where php scripts were set up to pipe information from the sql database to the users device in a way to minimize computation time on the users device.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>For the back end a very big wall i ran into was companies storing their product information in a very wide range of ways, often specifically designed to prevent data collections of this nature.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>Setting up a multi-input php script that uses smart thinking to parse the incoming data arrays with very minimal if any modification from the programmer when adding a new store.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>A wide variety of things including the correct way to format json requests</p>\n<h2>What's next for Shopping List</h2>\n<p>We are both surprised and extremely pleased by the success we had with our app!

It is meant to be a simple, clean, secure way of event planning. The user experience is supposed to be dead simple\u2014you open the app, it asks you where and when you want to meet up (using the Yelp API to retrieve restaurants or parks near you), and who you want to invite. The invitees would then receive an email with a giant \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d button that they can click on to RSVP to the event. Right before the event, all parties that said yes to the event will get a reminder email, and then it will disappear forever. The application is meant to be the Snapchat of event planning, where nothing is logged, making it useful for all kinds of small impromptu events.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mailgun\">mailgun</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://impromptify.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://impromptify.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>impromptify.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on backend design and website creation", "I worked on the backend webservices using node, express, mongo.", "I worked on the mobile application using React Native and the Redux framework.", "I worked on the Mobile iOS app using react native"]], ["TripFlow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TripFlow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/965/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TripFlow \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/002/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When you visit a city, you often ask your friends there what are events to check out, places to eat and things to see.\nThey would list it to you, but we thought this experience could be more seamless and engaging.\nTripFlow allows locals to go on it and it will query their Facebook events, social media to list points of interest on a  map.

Whether it is a difficult to configure install process or a slow internet connection, it can kill productivity. You want to iterate as quickly as possible, and this tool allows you to do just that.</p>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h2>Execution</h2>\n<p>We use <code>foxy</code> as the listener for all of your commands. This was built with a complex bash parsing algorithm. After your local machine quits, Foxy saves the day by escalating your command to our Google Compute Engine Server. At this point, the resolution occurs with yet another bash script.

We wanted to allow developers and designers to focus on what really matters. The product. We wanted a faster development cycle; no more coding and long iteration cycles. We were tired of porting apps from Android to iOS and vice-versa. We wanted to save time and put the fun back into \"iterative functional prototypes\", so we created Prototypr.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Prototypr instantly transforms wireframe sketches of mobile application UI into a functional mobile app. This allows for rapid prototyping of various UI designs so you can spend more time experimenting and iterating without coding any more boilerplates.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The project consists of an Android app that takes pictures and uploads them to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. An application that resides on our computers is able to fetch these images and send them to a python image processing module powered by OpenCV. This module first detects rectangles in the image (these translate to containers in the final generated app). It then detects other more complex UI elements such as buttons, image views, and text views through detection of specific symbols in the image, and attempts to use tesseract for OCR on labels. The final output is a tree of UI elements described by a JSON object which is passed to another module that translates it into React JSX template language and a React stylesheet. We chose React, the Facebook-backed modern frontend framework, for its ability to build to all 3 major client platforms: web, Android, and iOS using a singular paradigm. The final, generated React file is then compiled and built into an Android application APK and installed to an Android phone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the hardest tasks in developing this project was figuring out how to effectively process user photos into structured trees of objects. Even after deciding on OpenCV as our main driver, no one had any experience with it and we had to learn while doing. As well, we found our ambitions of true OCR for notes and the like were hampered by easy to integrate solutions, and little time to train a neural network that would fufill our needs.</p>\n<p>As well, none of the team members had experience developing React native applications and we spent a significant amount of time understanding the fundamental principles of React and figuring out how to build and deploy a React project into an Android application.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The team was able to utilize OpenCV to create an image processing module that accurately detects UI elements in wireframe sketches, regardless of users' drawing abilities or the lighting conditions of the photo. We were also very happy with the seamlessness with which we translated the JSON to React to an Android app. For a SDK that came out a week ago, we were very happy with how well we tied things together.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The team learned both advanced image processing and the React development process and SDK. Since OpenCV is one of the largest open source computer vision libraries in the world, and React is one of the leading multi-platform frontend frameworks, we were very happy to dive deep into both of these technologies. From a soft skill perspective, we learned how to work quickly and iteratively in a small team while effectively splitting tasks as well as how sleep deprivation is one of those problems that doesn't go away.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Prototypr</h2>\n<p>Refining the image processing logic to detect more UI elements, more accurately, as well as implementing CAFFE (LeNet) for better OCR and handwriting recogntion. Generating more sophisticated and aesthetically pleasing UI, and giving users more flexibility with design options. We will also focus on multiple screens and the ability to create control flows and linking between screens.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tesseract\">tesseract</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/htn-prototypr/prototypr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/htn-prototypr/prototypr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["image processing with OpenCV and tesseract (python)", "", ""]], ["MyKoala", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MyKoala \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/475/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Interested in social hacking</li>\n<li>Wanting to make it easy to find volunteer opportunities</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>it pulls the pages that you liked from Facebook and searches for categories that align with charities in your area.

No one likes scrolling through pages and pages of products to find what you want to buy. We set out to create an online store that is smart and adaptive to economic insights around a consumer's region, supplying the buyer with the best options of products to purchase. Greatly simplying the cumbersome online shopping experience; making it easier, quicker, and seamless.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We use Bloomberg's economic insights (e.g. buyer confidence, unemployment, mean income, dairy production) to recommend products that appeal to the average consumers in a specific region. By doing so, the user experience is simplified and enhanced. Instead of showing multiple brands of the same product, the store can promote the brand that has the highest retention. Smartmart will also promote certain deals and loyalty programs to maximize sales.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>First, we pull 10 years worth of economic data from Bloomberg's API such as consumer confidence and unemployment rates. We then analyze the data and discover trends to assess current and future economic standings the user's region. With these assessments we're able to specifically recommend certain brands of products based on price, deals, and quality (e.g. low buyer confidence = cheaper savings upfront, low risk items promoted). The backend was built in Node &amp; Express, the frontend was built in Angular &amp; a couple other libraries.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble finding the best use case of the plethora of data supplied by Bloomberg's API. When we finally decided on a use case, we had challenges analyzing trends and making conclusions from our data. During the last few hours we were rate limited due to querying 10 years of data at a time. Luckily we cached a local version of the Bloomberg db beforehand, so we were able to access that directly from memory.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud that we were able to take on Bloomberg's challenge and make something so cool using of data they provide. We feel that our project has the ability to simplify the online shopping experience for buyers.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned alot about large data anayltics and the power that data holds. We are excited to work with more big datasets in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SmartMart</h2>\n<p>SmartMart is a proof of concept of online stores that adapt to macro economic insights. In the future, there will be rich and percise microeconomic data and from there we want to be able to suggest resturaunts, products, entertainment, etc based on your location and small-scale, fast-changing data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uikit\">uikit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chartjs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pacejs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">famous</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bloomberg\">bloomberg</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree\">braintree</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://smartmart.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://smartmart.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>smartmart.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Ciao", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2AXhqckgw8?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ciao \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/963/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ciao \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/964/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ciao \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/965/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ciao \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/966/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The idea for this app came when me and my partner were talking to a friend. We all needed help with a question and it occurred to us that it would be great to know that any of these strangers around us were proficient in mathematics. A great mathematician could be sitting 10 feet away from us and we wouldn't even know it. And that's how Ciao was born!\nWe designed it to be a tool that would allow us to broadcast our interests and needs, and let us see those of the people around us.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Ciao is an app that uses your geo-location data to allow you to interact with people around you (up to 200 ft). It allows users to log in using Facebook and get their profile. Then Ciao smartly suggests some of the things the user is interested in based on the data collected from their Facebook profile. The user is then able to add more interests as they see fit. Once its setup, you are taken to a screen that shows the <strong>interests</strong> and <strong>needs</strong> of the people around you. Using these, you are able to see who that person is and thus, you are able to communicate with them. Ciao was built with a concern in mind. Ciao doesn't want to be the app that you spend your entire day staring it. It wants to enhance the quality of your life, rather than make your life around it. Therefore Ciao lets you locate these people and aims to serve as a medium to meet new people outside of that little phone window.  </p>\n<p>Our app hopes to bring people together in real life, bringing a real social impact on society. </p>\n<p>Our app has three sections: a profile, a broadcast toggle and a nearby list. In the profile you can keep topics that you are knowledgeable about or have a passion for. In the broadcasting section you can choose when you are visible. Finally, in the search section you can see those broadcasting around you. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Ciao was built using Ionic framework, which allows you to port your code to iOS, Android, Windows, and Blackberry etc. Therefore, Ciao is ready to work on all those operating systems. It was written primarily in Angular.js, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. We obtain user profile from Facebook and are using Firebase as our back end database. When, the user broadcasts their location using the app, their location data is compared against other active users using Firebase. If two users are in closeby proximity, there interests become visible to each other and that's how they can learn about each other and say 'Ciao'.</p>\n<p>Me and Arjun, both tackled different aspects of it, helping each other when they were stuck. My contribution to Ciao consists of the majority of design and the UI of the application. I also tackled some aspects of the back-end like incorporating Facebook's API into our app design. We ran into several issues porting the app to an android device. I worked on the majority of that as well. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge we ran into was running the Ionic app on an android device or emulator. We were unaware of permissions that were needed to run it smoothly. So that took some time trying to figure out.</p>\n<p>The second issue was neither of us were familiar Angular.js. To solve this, we read up documentation and tutorials that were available online. </p>\n<p>The implementation of Facebook withing the app was another issue. Due to our usage of Angular.js, there wasn't much documentation available online on how we could achieve this.</p>\n<p>The final issue was using Firebase as our backend and having it be able to communicate with the app. Thankfully, Firebase representatives were at the event and they were a big help to us. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm very proud of Ciao. Integration with Facebook and Firebase took up a lot of our time, with us tackling bugs and errors, one after the other. We were also able to design it with Material design, which I believe is a big accomplishment.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I became proficient in Angular.js for the purpose of using Ionic for our app. I also learnt a lot about Facebook and Firebase's API. This is the first Android app I have designed and therefore, I learnt how to implement Google's Material Design in an Android app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ciao!</h2>\n<p>Ciao will continue to grow beyond Hack the North. Multiple new features will be incorporated in the coming weeks. We plan on introducing a distance limiter to locate users within a certain radius. We also plan on modifying some of the design elements of the app and publishing it on the Google Playstore and the Appstore.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HarryPahwa/CiaotheApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HarryPahwa/CiaotheApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Harry and I both came up with the idea together with our friend from school. We both attacked the application together, splitting our time and resources wherever best to keep us motivated and engaged. With that being said, it turns out that most of my work happened in the backend. I installed the Facebook API and brought in the Facebook \"likes\" and user info - integral for loading the application at large with data. I also installed the Firebase backend and wrote the code to sync all the data with Firebase. I did some front end as well, though that was mainly where the backend came into play.

That's because this project came in when the original project I worked on with a team became too much for me to take at one point. *</em></p>\n<p>This is a project I tried working on alone.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I wanted to recreate the feel of someone playing an 80s computer game back then because as much as we are totally bombarded by the computer games we have today, the feeling of playing 80s games and the talent needed is most likely gone. By rebuilding the game from scratch with modern tools and incorporate different elements, such as procedural generation and pixel-based art, I\u2019m able to recreate the feeling and let the people of today get exposed to it to really see what the games in the 80s were about.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>What the program was supposed to do was to run a Bomberman-based game on a Java GUI application with colors from one of the palettes of the Color Graphics Adapter to give that 80s feeling; yellow, green, and red. </p>\n<p>The procedural generation part was to place bricks in place of some floor tiles but not all of them, because the original game had blocks where you need to blow up a bomb to clear them. The same goes for the enemies that I have yet to conceive. There would be three difficulty settings on the game, and as a start, probably three different levels.</p>\n<p>8-bit music would be downloaded from Kevin MacLeod, and 8-bit sound would be downloaded from a Creative Commons website</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The entire program itself was to be written in Java in such a way where I would only use the simplest graphics tool I know, and that would be the paintComponent function of a JPanel. All the sprites I would need were to be done using the free version of GraphicsGale, which is a pixel art application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This project only came to realization when sometime on Saturday afternoon, I found out that I felt way too pressured to keep up with the involvement with my team, primarily because I came into Hack the North rather unprepared. It was my first time attending such a hackathon, yet since it took place between my first and second week of school, I was too bombarded with homework for me to realize a few things. There was also me needing a break before I start Software Engineering 2A at UWaterloo.</p>\n<p>I think the biggest challenge was that I ran way too short on time, especially with how I wanted to keep my standard routine of going to bed and sleeping before midnight. That\u2019s because I have a hard time standing up to having my head burning and feeling heavy if I was to stay up until 2 or 3 AM.</p>\n<p>There was also the fact that I didn\u2019t practice using the resources I got before I started working on the project. Everything was sort of last minute.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any accomplishments I feel proud of.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Since this was my first hackathon, what I learned from it was that the next time I attend a hackathon, I should prepare my knowledge in advance so that I don\u2019t have to call up on StackOverflow to help me out with some functionality too much. This is also to practice programs and ask the volunteers and organizers for support on coming up with ideas for what to work on.</p>\n<p>I feel that there\u2019s way too much for me to work on, especially when I feel jealous of not having the same kind of approaches as other people would make, and that is having an intelligent approach. It\u2019s complicated to tell, so I would rather explain it after the hackathon is over.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Freaky Bomb Freak</h2>\n<p>Keep on working. Come up with the enemies, do the artwork, then try to put them together by coming up with the game board explicitly and doing all the programming to have the game work autonomously. I may decide at one point to change the technology I would use for the sake of learning, because I don\u2019t want to find out later that I\u2019m on a blank or outdated slate.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["sentinel-app", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K56j69PMjVE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sentinel-app \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/608/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sentinel-app \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/609/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sentinel-app \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/610/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sentinel-app \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/611/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sentinel-app \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/612/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"sentinel-app \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/613/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>sentinel-app</h1>\n<h1>firebase-api</h1>\n<h1>best-social-impact</h1>\n<p>Project for Hack the North</p>\n<p>It all began with a break in. \nThen a second. </p>\n<p>By the time the sixth occurred, I was completely fed up - the police didn't care, and my car looked like it was shambles. It's not like I kept anything important in there - I'm a student for goodness sake! But the fact that they somehow hit up my car in the middle of the night when the alarm was set and no one had noticed anything was beyond me.</p>\n<p>The annoyance I felt only vanished when a car alarm down the street went off.</p>\n<p>I groaned and threw a pillow over my face. \"Will it never end, can't they just shut it off?\" I thought. </p>\n<p>Wait a minute. My own reaction told me all I need to know: we, living in an urban center, are completely desensitized to car alarms. We assume that they go off for no other reason than to annoy your neighbors, or when accidentally popping the trunk to our own cars without turning off the alarm first. Yes, the car alarm started as a beneficial thing - highly prized, but how many hail storms leave us feeling miffed from the cacophony of noise?</p>\n<p>Enter Sentinel.</p>\n<p>Sentinel is the solution for the modern car alarm. It's silent.</p>\n<p>\"Silent,\" you say, \"Ha! How on Earth would that help? May as well hand over the keys right now!\"</p>\n<p>Well, why not hand me your phone instead? You see, Sentinel is always with you. Your car's protection rests in your own hands. One click, and you can sleep in ease knowing you will be informed of a problem <strong>only</strong> when we sense your car door is being opened - without you nearby.</p>\n<p>Give us a try - we're positive you'll trust your car's security to Sentinel. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/curl\">curl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">best-social-impact</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">social-impact</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sound</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">alarm</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/katiea/sentinel-app\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/katiea/sentinel-app\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Design, Back-end dev, API guru, & PM", "I worked on the web development and design-- did all the design work from start to finish, built the web app using HTML/CSS/JS, and integrated firebase.", ""]], ["photonet", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>It's really easy to upload a photo from your camera when you're on your phone, but not so easy to do from a laptop.

By creating a new event, they are able to add a name of the event, location, a range of dates within which they believe the event should be held, invite their friends and upload an event picture. After their friends have been invited, from the range of dates set by the creator, they choose whichever days work for them. In addition, Google Calendar allows for their schedule to be checked to automatically check when they are available on the selected days.

It has a proprietary plug that needs to be cut off and have the wires soldered to a USB3 connector to be able to connect to a PC. However even after doing this we were not able to get it to properly work for almost 24 hours. So we had to abandon our idea.</p>\n<p>During the troubleshooting there were many instances where we needed to copy/paste text quickly between our PCs and since we didn't know each other's social media or want to create new accounts we quickly became involved in an annoying mess of transferring files over USB. When our hardware hack didn't pan out, I decided to do something to tackle this issue.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Effectively; the clipboards on two PCs become the same clipboard. Anything copied on one PC is paste-able from the other and vice versa. There isn't much of a UI right now, the program just runs in the background.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>A dirty, atrocious, horrendously written and convoluted set of shell scripts manipulating a shared Dropbox folder (which could have been substituted with any kind of network drive) between two users to transfer data between the machines. These scripts are also responsible for reading and writing to the operating system clipboard.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Tried to use various libraries (C and C++) to manipulate the clipboard and wasted many hours. Don't deal with these cross-platform libraries when working with the clipboard unless you are a masochist. Even if you were to copy examples in the documentation (when there was documentation) the code won't even compile; or if it does compile it will immediately segfault when run.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Although this hack isn't very technically impressive or innovative, I'm glad to have finished in such limited time.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>How to write shell scripts.</p></li>\n<li><p>Not to write shell scripts.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for clip-sync</h2>\n<p>To develop it further; I'd improve the latency, add a proper user interface, make toggling it on/off easier, fix bugs and allow it to work with more then text.</p>\n<p>Oh and I'd rewrite it in a saner manner.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/dropbox\">dropbox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cygwin</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I made this."]], ["Airchat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7PjyIKRbP0M?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Airchat \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/476/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Airchat \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/477/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Airchat \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/475/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Airchat \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/480/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Watching the Hack the North livestream, we couldn't help but notice a lack of interaction and understanding with the chat on YouTube.

From this, we thought of displaying the weight on the bathroom mirror. Finally, we realized that we could share much more information through the internet of things. </p>\n<p>Also, mornings suck.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Reflect superimposes information on a reflection of the user, allowing users to multitask. The user has access to the time, date, weather, their calendar, estimated time of arrival to work (Google Maps driven), estimated Uber cost, stocks, news headlines, measured weight, calculated body-mass index, calories burned throughout the day (Google Fit API driven, to be implemented), and an estimated energy level. The user can access all this information at a glance hands-free. The mirror uses a LEAP motion sensor to let the user switch between two panes with a simple swipe.</p>\n<p>While you're brushing your teeth, fixing your tie, or doing your hair, you can focus on what's important - the day ahead.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Scale - We reverse engineered the scale to push weight readings through a Spark Core to our server. This way, Reflect could receive live data directly. Our team conducted circuit analysis with probes, soldering, and experimentation to build the new circuit and math relationship.</p>\n<p>Energy Levels - We researched Myo, its scientific accuracy, and the correlation between EMG data and muscle fatigue in academic research on Pubmed. Through this, we confirmed the feasibility to correlate frequency with muscle fatigue. So, we obtained the data from Myo's eight sensors, ran them through a Fast Fourier Transform, and took the mean of the frequency distribution. Since the frequency reflects the activity of strong and weak motor units in muscles, we can compare the user's means over time to predict how energized they are relative to their past. The % reading is interpreted as '100 - percentile ranking'.</p>\n<p>The main interface was done through HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. A number of APIs (Uber, Google Maps, etc.) were used to support the retrieval of information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Myo - The Myo documentation was confusing. While we tested the device to verify its functionality and found the necessary libraries but we could not get it to work reliably.</p>\n<p>Scale - While reverse engineering the scale, there was no supporting documentation for the internal circuitry. There was a lot of trial and error finding the right pins to interact with to receive the voltage readings from the pressure sensor and correlating the change in voltage with the person's weight.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We are proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team, we have put together a full-stack project with a clean UI and smooth UX. We were able to accomplish most of our ambitions and visions for the project idea coming in. We shared cool ideas with other hackers and built on our respective creativity.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>Many of us were not experts in design, front-end and back-end development so this experience was great for learning new languages and techniques and exploring new areas. We also learned many new APIs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Reflect</h2>\n<p>We hope to get the Myo portion working and build the accuracy of the scale. Also, we would like to get the Google Fit data to be expanded upon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">internet-of-things</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">reverse-engineering</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ProjectReflect\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ProjectReflect\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on building the circuit that allowed the scale to pass analog input, and programmed the spark code to convert the output to digital and transfer the value to the server.

Why not take it a step further and remove the human component entirely?</p>\n<p>## What it does\nConGen automatically generates content using a recurrent neural network.</p>\n<p>## How I built it\nThe back end consists of <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn\" rel=\"nofollow\">an open source recurrent neural network script by Andrej Karpathy</a> built with Torch/Lua, which has been trained on a year of the top Medium content from each month. The training and sampling is run on Google Cloud, which granted us 16 cores of computing power. To scrape the Medium content, we used the BeautifulSoup library in Python. In order to complete the front end portion of the app, we created an instance on Linode to support an AngularJS app. The app will communicate to the back end in order to get the relevant data, then display it to the user. In addition, we also made use of Firebase to keep track of the number of times each link is clicked on.</p>\n<p>## Challenges I ran into\nThis project was our first foray into machine learning as well as web scraping. Michael and I spent a lot of time pair coding to get all this working. We are very thankful for all the mentorship available at Hack the North, and were helped by engineers from Facebook, Google, Firebase, Indico, Yelp, and Linode. Another challenge that we had is that about 4% of the top Medium content is in Spanish, and this had to be manually filtered out from our training set. Lastly, due to the large computational power necessary to train the recurrent neural network, and the limited time we had, we could not input a very large training set. For the front end portion, the main challenge was getting the jsonp to accept the file format being passed to it.</p>\n<p>## Accomplishments that I'm proud of\nWe're proud to have successfully incorporated recurrent neural networks. We all worked with new technologies that many of us are unfamiliar with, and we still managed to create an MVI.</p>\n<p>## What I learned\nWe've now had our first exposure to different technologies - machine learning, web scraping, Aashni learnt a lot about deploying apps onto both Google Cloud and Linode servers.

One distinct trend is people's desire for larger and better (and sometimes curved) TVs. However, these large TVs are difficult in terms of space-taking, weight, and cost. Home theatre projectors have therefore been on the rise as a method of resolving this problem. Unfortunately, projectors are limited greatly by the rooms they are in. They rely on specific levels of light, and require a clean white flat surface to project on. This provides an obstacle to usage by the general public, such as students, families, and small business owners.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Adaptor resolves the last two issues: Colour can be corrected by a filter from the base projection surface colour, and skew can be calibrate by a perspective inverse algorithm. A 3D printed mount combines the hardware (camera, boards, and projector).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>A raspberry pi with a camera was used to take a snapshot of the wall where we wanted to project our screen. We then used the Dropbox Api to send the images to the laptop for processing. APIs such as OpenCV and SDL were used to do the backend, which heavily involves image processing. Lastly, a new and calibrated image is projected to the wall, so it appears straight.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The largest issue was the integration of the hardware - specifically, the Raspberry Pi component. Physical limitations of the hardware had negative on how the software performed, both in the quality of the data to be captured and the ability to perform as the intensity of the algorithms increased.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>High-end software. Skew calibration fully functional. Colour calibration had good progress. Integrated several different technologies - essentially across 4 APIs and multiple platforms.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>New languages (such as C++), new APIs (such as OpenCV and Dropbox).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Adaptor</h2>\n<p>Continued product develop, research analytics, and market launch strategy.

However most organizations have specific needs in regards to the items that would add the most value to their services. One example is the food bank where certain supplies are more in demand than others. It is common for food banks to have an item priority list for their donors but they are not easily accessible and many donors are unaware of them. This creates a disconnect between what organizations need and what donors provide. Our solution aims to bridge this gap. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Kado is a word in Dutch that translates to \"gift\" and our app is about helping ordinary people give gifts to local charities. The app has two types of customers. One is the organization which can create a profile and post lists of needed items. This can include items for it's services such as food or office supplies to help with the organization's administration work. The other are donors interested in contributing to their community through tangible items. They are able to sign in through their Google account and get a list of local charities in their area that need items. They can browse a charity's profile and lists of needed items. A special feature is that the donor can commit to fulfilling a charity's need by selecting an item and detailing how much they can give. The charity is then notified about the person's commitment and can follow up with them to ensure it gets delivered. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Lots of love, and with an awesome software stack. Our application is backed by a Google App Engine back-end, and runs on the ever ubiquitous Android OS. We gathered data from charity websites from all over Brampton as a starting user base, and used the data to build our server back-end. The Android client accesses this through the Google Cloud Endpoint APIs, providing our users the means to better impact their communities.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Kado</h2>\n<p>Kado hopes to build a platform that actively encourages registered donors to give back to their communities. Through gamification of the application, users would be able to gain points and rewards for their contributions. There would also be a system in place for organizations to track donor deliveries. When a donor drops off the items at the location, the organization would check them in and the commitment to give they made on the app would move to delivered items. This ensures that donors are fulfilling the commitments they make on the app. Additionally, another feature we hope to add is social goal setting for the user. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">appengine</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MapleWorld/Donate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/MapleWorld/Donate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aerovulpe/kado\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/aerovulpe/kado\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Electioneering - The Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Electioneering - The Game \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/495/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Electioneering - The Game \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/496/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Electioneering - The Game \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/497/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Electioneering - The Game \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/498/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Electioneering - The Game \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/499/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p><em>Electioneering</em> is a game set in a fairly detailed simulation of Canadian electoral politics where you play the leader of the NDP, Liberals or Conservatives and you must adapt and market your positions on important issues to garner support.

The twitter feed is based on the satisfaction/dissatisfaction of these individual citizens and is pulled from real tweets about the Canadian election run through Indico's sentiment analysis API to determine when they should be shown.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>A series of map generation scripts written in Ruby take in real polling data, issues of importance, geographic maps, locations of major cities and populations of the different provinces to produce a detailed map of Canada with regional demographics and political leanings.</p>\n<p>The tweets are also scraped in with a Go microservice using the Twitter and Indico APIs.</p>\n<p>All of this data is fed in as JSON files, plus a generated SVG file for the map.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is all done in client side javascript using ES6. The design is all done with flexbox, SVG styling and CSS3 animations. Most of the processing of the dataset of generated citizens is done in the client's browser. This includes algorithms for taking a set of political views and updating a citizen's affinities for each party based on how well their views match up with the party's.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the polling data on the set of Canadian issues we used was done through internet polls and was heavily left-wing biased, and especially towards the NDP. I had to manually add a bias towards the Conservatives in the generator (correlated linearly with the age of the citizen). I also added a bias towards the Liberals in large cities so that the race would be nice and even, just like it is in real life right now. You can win no matter which party you choose, at the cost of some true-to-life accuracy.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The UI ended up really nice and quite slick. I'm also proud of the map generation code, which is a centerpiece of the game.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Electioneering - The Game</h2>\n<p>Mostly game balance, there's lots of power factors that were chosen somewhat arbitrarily that need to be tuned to have a gameplay experience that is challenging, but not impossible. Also we might time limit the election period and not allow you to call the election day at any time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sinatra\">sinatra</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">svg</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">es6</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pahgawk/Electioneering\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pahgawk/Electioneering\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote all the map and citizen generation code as well as some of the front end.", "I wrote the part that handles opportunities, and the part that uses politicians' responses to those opportunities to sway voter opinion.

By playing a high pitched sound and listening to its echos, we can use the changes in frequency (caused by the Doppler effect) to detect movement.</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>By implementing the ideas mentioned above, DopplMotion allows the user to perform basic gestures such as \"spike\" and \"drop.\" For example, if the user does a \"spike\" gesture by lifting their hand off the keyboard quickly, DopplMotion will switch to the next application. If the user performs the \"drop\" gesture and quickly drops their hand onto the keyboard, DopplMotion will open the Launchpad. Because DopplMotion can perform arbitrary commands for any detectable gesture, the possibilities are <em>endless</em>.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>DopplMotion was written in Swift 2 using Cocoa and EZAudio, along with a <strong>lot</strong> of research (believe it or not, physics is pretty hard!).</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>There were challenges for us on every step of the way. Perhaps the biggest one was implementing the actual gesture recognition technology\u2014how do you differentiate between a \"tap\" and a \"drop\", when both gestures go in the same direction with the same initial velocities? Not easily, we can tell you. We also had to wander through the badly-documented lands of Swif  because of interfacing issues between Swift, C, and Objective-C++.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We're really excited that we can track basic movements through just audio input and output\u2014it still baffles us that it's even possible in the first place. We're also really proud that we managed to finish so much in such a short amount of time. We're pretty sure it took the creators of Leap Motion more than 36 hours to create their inital MVP ;).</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We definitely learned more than we expected. When we began working on DopplMotion, we thought it would be trivial to follow the paper and implement it step-by-step. However, like most projects, we ran into many unforseen bugs and challenges. Even with reference implementations, it was difficult to calibrate the program and make it respond correctly to the chaotic real world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">swift2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ezaudio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">doppler-effect</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoa\">cocoa</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Danappelxx/DopplMotion\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Danappelxx/DopplMotion\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the internal class structure and the application itself.", "I worked on understanding the physics and helped improve the accuracy of the gestures.", "Worked on conceptual physics of project.

The Myo is designed to recognize five different hand gestures and rudimentary arm motion.  We wanted more than that.  </p>\n<h2>What We Did</h2>\n<p>Though the Myo SDK only supports five gestures, one can access the raw EMG data from the device as well.  Using this raw data we computed the root mean square (rms) for each of the eight individual sensors on the Myo.  This allowed us to turn the constantly variable electrical potentials on your skin into eight integers. <br/><br/> Our eight-dimensional vector is \"plotted\" allowing us to compare it to the calibrated values for each workout.  The comparison is done using a k-nearest neighbor system.  But this didn't allow us to get the fidelity we wanted from the system.  So we added in accelerometer data from the IMU to allow us reliably tell the difference between up and down in push ups, sit ups, and pull ups. <br/><br/> On top of all of this we overlaid a rudimentary AI/trainer.  The trainer can tell you how many reps you have done, offer encouragement, and give you metrics about your exercise.</p>\n<h2>How We Did It</h2>\n<p>The whole project is written in Python.  We used TK for our GUI.  <a href=\"https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/myo-python\" rel=\"nofollow\">myo-python</a> was used to interface with the Myo.</p>\n<h2>FAQ</h2>\n<h4>Can you preload exercises?</h4>\n<p>Yes, but no.  It would be possible to save the data you generate in a given session, however it is unlikely to be particularly useful.  It is rare that two people can use the same calibrated settings, and even slight displacements of the Myo can throw off the data.  It is best to dedicate a minute at the beginning of each session to proper calibration.</p>\n<p>Made by <a href=\"https://github.com/pwstegman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pierce Stegman</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/peterjrohrer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Rohrer</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/2016rshah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rushi Shah</a> at Hack The North 2015.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">health</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pwstegman/myofit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pwstegman/myofit\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Preliminary EMG gesture classification research, Myo interfacing, training data collection, frontend", "", ""]], ["Speakon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Speakon \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/391/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Speakon \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/392/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Speakon \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/404/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Speakon \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/405/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I've been really curious to see what people standing at the bus stop or eating in a food court would say to the people around them, people they could see and hear, if they would remain anonymous.

The \"difficulty level\" is an indication of how far a user is willing to travel from their center of adventure. </p>\n<p>Some of the fields, such as the tour guide and difficulty level, are left to be slightly facetious and ambiguous to add a level of anticipation and mystery to their food adventure.  </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The backend of the web app is in PHP and Javascript, which first processes the Yelp API call to retrieve venues and then displayed on Google Maps via their API. The front-end of the site is built with Bootstrap.js and designed responsively for mobile and web.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>_ Front-end_\nOne of the main issues that we encountered was compatibility between devices and browser, where buttons would show up for Android and Windows, while unable to be viewed on iOS. Learning the HTML5 documentation, especially with localStorage, was new to us, and took longer than we expected. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We focused on user-centered design, being conscious of flow in input fields, toggling of buttons, language and tone, and responsive design. We also believe that the overall idea is scalable, usable, and an application that we would definitely use ourselves. We also like the tone that the app conveyed, with its playfulness and fun interactions. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML5 </li>\n<li>front-end development</li>\n<li>Yelp/Google Map APIs</li>\n<li>backend/front-end connectivity</li>\n<li>user experience</li>\n<li>responsive design</li>\n<li>Bootstrap.js</li>\n<li>work with strangers WOW </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Dishcovery</h2>\n<p>We would love to see more detail in branding and graphic design so it feels even more like planning your own adventure. There is also a lot of room to add options in designing such an adventure (such as multiple points of interest, preferred times of travel). We'd also like to add more control on the map page so that users can update their preferences live to display on the map. Other cool features would include exporting a schedule to Google Calendars and displaying highly rated photos of certain venues from Instagram on the map. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://dishcovery.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://dishcovery.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>dishcovery.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://taimur.me/dishcovery/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://taimur.me/dishcovery/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>taimur.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Moodify", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZjgPSSx_WFE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Moodify \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/318/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Moodify \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/317/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Choosing the right music to play can be difficult.

Our desire to elevate the current quality of gaming inspired us to provide a thrilling experience for all ages. The challenge and opportunity to use hardware and software from Oculus Rifts and Myo armbands was one experience we couldn't pass away.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our easy to use interface allows users to create their own adventure with the freedom of virtual reality and gesture control systems.  Our spooky theme augments the user's experience by invoking surreal interactions such as the intense combats against ghouls. </p>\n<p>First, the user enters a dark world with only the aid of a flashlight, delivering a rush of adrenaline. The user can explore different aspects of the world such as the crates, puddles, and oil tanker. Then, the user battles randomly spawned ghosts with the flashlight which scare the user. The health decreases gradually when the ghosts hits the users. The goal of the game is to survive and accumulate points by defeating ghosts. It leaves the user exhilarated and eager for more action.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built it on the Unity Framework with APIs and SDKs from Thalmic Labs and Oculus. We rendered 3D objects with Blender for high quality transformations between scripts and objects. In addition, we customized Myo gestures with our C# scripts to authenticate user control over their environment. Specifically, we applied mathematics to create emulate real life gestures like the act of turning charging a flashlight. In addition, with the help of Unity's GameObjects and Components, we were able to include various aspects of physics in our game.  Finally, we optimized the Oculus Rift for the best overall experience. We made this experience as realistic as we could with the help of various cameras and input sensors. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>While writing the Myo scripts, we ran into obfuscating problems that required scrupulous debugging and analysis. \nThe time crunch challenged us to delegate tasks and organize our software development in an efficient manner. Our inexperience with Unity led us to have challenges imposed by the strict rules and hierarchy of Game Objects. Also, the endurance of learning 3D rendering for the first time led to many hours spent learning on online resources for Blender, leading us to a compromise for our projected features. Furthermore, interacting with the Myo armband exposed the absence of certain contrary to our pre-conceived notions.</p>\n<p>Overall, the great learning curve of designing  3D objects and programming in Unity for the first time required diligent effort and collaboration on all parts. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We are proud of</h2>\n<p>Fully grasping the foundations of Unity, Myo, and Oculus as well as developing a tangible product, gave us a great sense of accomplishment. Also, the various leadership roles that each member took upon catalyzed productivity and innovation.  Furthermore, the creation of a tangible product from programmers who met on social networks was a great achievement. </p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to apply and combine our different skill sets to the best of our abilities. In general, we learned to combat the inevitable circumstance of running into coding issues by seeking aid from peers, mentors, and online resources. We granted ourselves many opportunities to program efficiently by staying positive and remembering to have fun.</p>\n<h2>What's next for <em>Presence</em></h2>\n<p>We hope to improve graphics and program more complex functions which will advance the overall quality of our product. Specifically, this will constitute of multiplayer and network functionality.   </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Kyrri/Presence\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Kyrri/Presence\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on gesture recognition and analysis using the Myo Armband and the Unity Game Engine to enhance user experience.", "", "", ""]], ["Grind", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Grind \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/786/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Internet is this huge, huge source of data which offers the users the ability to do so much. One of the most staggering aspects of the internet is its ability to host so many opinions and information, and to democratize human thought (Col. Chris Hadfield). But with so much information floating around, it sometimes becomes tricky to follow the topics of interest. The sentimental opinions that the authors originally had are usually lost in this vast ocean of data. Even with all the different news sources and news curation services out there, there is not a good solution that tries to preserve, let alone promote, the biggest human element in these news and blog posts--the human emotions and sentiments. This is where Grind comes in. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Grind</strong> is a web application for reading news, articles, and blog posts that adds a new dimension to the act of reading. Grind gathers articles from multiple online sources, and uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the sentiment the author tried to put into the piece of writing. It also discovers keywords associated with the text, so as to give a quick summary to the reader. All this information is provided to the user in a very modern and delightful way that allows them to either skim through the articles, or open them to read further. Visit grindonline.co to check it out!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Grind is a two-tiered app system: there is the web front-end, powered by React and facilitated by Node.js, and is hosted in Heroku; and there is the cloud back-end, developed in C#/.NET, fed by WebHose and granted the brains by Indico. It is hosted in Azure.</p>\n<p>The web front-end queries the cloud back-end for the various search queries, and then presents it in a meaningful and delightful way. The back-end cloud service facilitates these requests by curating articles of importance from WebHose. It then leverages Indico to get meaningful NLP information about these news articles, and presents all this information to the client app. The back-end is a front-end agnostic RESTful API that can potentially serve other clients in the future as well.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge that we originally faced was just finding a good multi-sourced news source, and how to integrate this with an NLP API. We finally decided to use WebHose for data because it looked simple, but powerful enough for our purposes, and gave all the data and metadata that we needed. We chose Indico for NLP, because of all the different things we could potentially do with it.</p>\n<p>The biggest technical challenge that we faced was coming up with a solution to provide a continued browsing experience to the users. Ideally, we wanted to not store any data about the user and their reading levels on the cloud or on the clients via cookies. How then shall we provide an experience that feels like a natural progression into a topic, especially given the request-serve based relation of the Grind front and back-ends? We considered using session IDs, but they would get nasty in terms of lifetime management. Moreover, they would still require storing stuff on the cloud based on the IDs. We considered providing batch information to the client, but what happens when an avid reader asks for more? Why should light users get the overhead of the processing required for a big batch of articles?</p>\n<p>What we ended up doing is, at least according to us, pretty cool! We are using WebHose's performance score and next URL combination to figure out what content the client needs. Through this, we can accurately calculate if the user just made the query, or is asking for more articles on the same topic. We would be able to calculate which batch of articles to then supply next. All of this, without storing anything to persistent storage anywhere! This approach is working pretty well, and we are so proud of it!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Besides addressing the above mentioned challenges in a hackathon environment, we are really proud of what we have made as a whole. We believe that there is definitely an audience for this app, and we think that it can definitely improve their reading experience.</p>\n<p>We are also proud of the engineering that we were able to put into this product, and which will potentially allow us to iterate and even expand to other platforms with relative ease in the future.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We grew ourselves both technically and personally. We built a really cool product in 36 hours--one that required us to think and hack the sh*t out of it! We learnt about new technologies, working with people, about new people, and even a bit about new cultures! </p>\n<h2>What's next for Grind</h2>\n<p>We would want to iterate on our design based on the feedback that we get. We really believe in this product, and we want to ensure that it does what we believe it can. Expanding to mobile platforms would also be a possibility.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/net\">.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/asp-net\">asp.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indico</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webhose</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.grindonline.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.grindonline.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.grindonline.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/udeyrishi/grind-back\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/udeyrishi/grind-back\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ahoskins/grind\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ahoskins/grind\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the back-end service for Grind, and got to learn tons about news and NLP APIs!", "I worked on the front end (React/Node/Browserify), pondered possible designs, and interfaced with Udey on efficient back-end architecture.

We've decided to focus on an issue in bioinformatics \u2013 handling the data from next generation sequencing. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We were interested in separation of sequences from biological noise and in data clustering. Traditionally, the methods that are used to solve these problems are heavily parameterized \u2013 for example, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering \u2013 making the clustering less robust and requiring precise parameter setup. Our hack consists of a data analysis and visualization package in Python. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Data\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/y3E4T4O.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--zHOgYJxz--/http://i.imgur.com/y3E4T4O.png\"/></p>\n<p>The analyzed data were taken from real experiments that look at the mutations occurring during the cycles of evolution of RNA molecules. These are common types of experiments in such fields like virology and origins of life.  </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We've developed a method that is based on the graph theory approaches. We represent the sequences as nodes of a graph, where edges and their weight capture how similar these sequences are. </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Initial graph\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/bwT7lT9.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--eFC_MsVD--/http://i.imgur.com/bwT7lT9.png\"/></p>\n<p>Such representation allows us to use the powerful network science toolbox for further analysis.

We've removed the edge with insufficient edge weight.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Simplified graph\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/H3FC1fb.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--xw-hFVT9--/http://i.imgur.com/H3FC1fb.png\"/></p>\n<p>We have used the Louvain Method to discover the underlying community structure of the graph. The method divides the nodes into clusters, maximizing their internal connectivity and minimizing the external connections between them. Such approach is a good fit to our problem, as the related sequences have a high similarity index, translating into high edge weight and, thus, high internal connectivity. The resulting community structure divides the sequences according to their similarities. The method does not require any precise parameter setup and is parallel, making it appropriate for large-scale experiments (we were able to process a graph with 2 million edges on a regular laptop). </p>\n<p><img alt=\"Community structure\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/cWijoa8.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--gp-5Y-Fi--/http://i.imgur.com/cWijoa8.png\"/></p>\n<p>We used Python for implementing the method. A number of libraries was used: NumPy, NetworkX, NetworKit, Matplotlib, IPython, and others.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The time required to process large datasets was outside the scope of the event (sequence alignment is very time consuming), thus we had to use medium-sized datasets.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we proud of</h2>\n<p>Using experimental RNA data, we were able to demonstrate that such method does achieve its goal \u2013 it robustly separates the sequences with the similar mutation profiles.  We've tried the method on 7 sets of data. In every case, it yielded satisfactory results.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We've gained additional knowledge about bioinformatics and scientific computing. </p>\n<h2>What's next for BClust</h2>\n<p>Other network science techniques could be applied to the sequence graphs. We have already considered link prediction and dynamic graph partitioning.

We want to make university a friendlier place for students. Classes are large, and sometimes we don\u2019t feel comfortable speaking to our classmates. Thus, we often study by ourselves, and formulate questions that we alone can\u2019t answer.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Study with Company was created to bring students with common courses together. Through a live campus map and checking in through web as well as Pebble, one can broadcast their location and course they're studying for. </p>\n<p>Once broadcasted, anyone on campus studying for the same course can join them to create a study group.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Taking advantage of the Google maps API, jQuery and Firebase, we divided the project into three parts:</p>\n<p><strong>- Web map</strong></p>\n<p>The web app, hosting a map of University of Waterloo using Google maps, was integrated with Firebase to keep a real time record of all students looking to study. When location and course are pushed (by checking in), they appear as a marker on the map until removed.</p>\n<p><strong>- Firebase</strong></p>\n<p>Firebase was used as a replacement for the backend and as a hosting service. Location data, whether captured through Pebble or web, is pushed to Firebase. From Firebase, the web app pulls all the information about students looking to study.</p>\n<p>As a hosting service, Firebase is hosting our web map and related files.</p>\n<p><strong>- Pebble app</strong></p>\n<p>As a way of pushing location data, we decided to take advantage of the Pebble API. A user wearing the smart watch can open our app, select the course they want to study and have their location data pushed to Firebase. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Before Saturday, our experience in jQuery, Javascript, Pebble and Firebase was next to nothing. Starting Saturday afternoon, we started to familiar ourselves with Pebble hardware, Firebase and CloudPebbleIDE. All these things started to cause major problems with each other. Our Firebase was not syncing properly with the Pebble, the IDE was buggy and kept crashing, Javascript was connecting through the wrong sockets, it was a mess.</p>\n<p>We decided to use the free pop.co domain offered to us, what we didn't expect to happen was have their name servers not work. It took 6 hours and a lot of frustration to realize our DNS settings were never going to propagate, leading us to use 3rd party Dreamhost name servers.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Even though this was our first hackathon and the first time touching Pebble and Firebase, we managed to learn enough in one afternoon to create our project. This was a major feat for us because of how intimidating everything was at first, but led to be manageable.</p>\n<p>I'm also proud of being able to stay awake 48 hours without more than a few hours of sleep.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Since it was all of our first hackathons, to say we learned a lot is an understatement. Technical skills aside, we learned a lot about how we function late at night, how hungry everyone is at 4am and how much sleep is important.</p>\n<p>Our biggest lesson would probably be that it is okay to change your idea. We definitely had an idea going into the hackathon, but we changed it with about 18 hours left to code. It ended up working out since we\u2019re submitting this!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Study with Company</h2>\n<p>Integration with other API's to allow more features for users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/web\">web</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://studywith.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://studywith.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>studywith.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/allawi/benchwith.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/allawi/benchwith.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Schedy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedy \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/221/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedy \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/224/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedy \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/226/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedy \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/227/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Hack The North 2015</h2>\n<p>Web application built using Firebase with the intention of helping instructors and students to arrange office hours appointments.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coffeescript\">coffeescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ademidun/Schedy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ademidun/Schedy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I am the Firebase girl.

Worst of all, some of these costs are recurring meaning they just wont stop! My inspiration comes from the big companies that love advertising and my hobby of nice cars which sadly I can't afford yet as a second year Electrical Engineering Student.</p>\n<p>Kervr is an iOS application that allows users to get paid to have ads on the outside of their car. Depending on where they drive, when they drive (time of day), and the distance they drive -  the money they make will vary depending on these variables. </p>\n<p>I built it using xCode and a local server for now. For my MVP I had a web based application to show the calculations happening in real time as well as an app to show the front end user interface.</p>\n<p>This was my first hackathon that I have done alone, the previous three I attended I had won a prize with my team. For this hackathon, I believed that if I did it alone I could grow as an individual and become a better hacker - although it was a challenge I truly believe I not only became a better hacker but a better sales man and am able to pitch my ideas much more concisely. </p>\n<p>Kervr will not be stopping here, I will be working on this project until the backend framework is complete. The databases are currently in a document and not on the cloud so I will be transferring that when the hackathon is complete.</p>\n<p><strong>bold</strong> // During the hackathon, I went to almost all the sponsor booths pitching my idea and telling them that I would like them to get involved in my Hack. If I am selected to be in the top 10, I told the sponsors that with a 25$ sponsorship towards Kervr I will provide them ad space on my slideshow while I pitch my idea to the 1000 attendees and judges. I received close to 250$. I couldn't care about the money - its the message that it sends. These companies spent 25$ for ad space on a wall, which just proves companies would definitely spend money to get on your cars. \\\\ <strong>bold</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/paypal\">paypal</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gps\">gps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["EDMDIS.CO", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EDMDIS.CO \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/938/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EDMDIS.CO \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/939/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EDMDIS.CO \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/940/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EDMDIS.CO \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/941/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to be a DJ, but were too lazy to learn about music theory, mixing boards and/or complicated programs?

We then normalized and autotuned the treble sounds, and adjust the speed of the treble to match the BPM of the bass.

That's why we decided to build Swing, a performance optimization app that records and analyzes data each time you throw your axe. It takes a rolling average of your throws, to come up with a throw signature that's unique to you. Each throw is compared to this average, as well as giving you per throw info. </p>\n<p>Our app wants to help you improve your axe throwing accuracy and consistency. But that comes as part of a much larger vision; when people learn quicker, they feel better about themselves, and enjoy themselves more.  Axe throwing ties back to our heritage; it makes us proud to be who we are. It's also used for team building, with increasing popularity amongst tech companies and adventurous souls.</p>\n<h2>Quick &amp; Dirty</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p>So what did we really build here? Let's start with our hardware.</p>\n<p>Texas Instrument SensorTag with the CC2650 wireless MCU and Bluetooth (in red, of course).</p>\n<p>All of the data was sent directly from the SensorTag to Swing. The first measurement we were able to take was peak G force reached during the throw. This is indicative of power of the throw. While this doesn't always guarantee accuracy, it does guarantee that your axe will have the force to make that satisfying sink into the target.</p>\n<p>We had intended to measure air time, but upon investigation we found that the throws were so quick that the acceleration data along the X axis was much more valuable.</p>\n<p>We measure the degrees of rotation of the axe because we know that landing blade first is paramount. Anything under 70\u00b0/sec is an under rotation, 70\u00b0/sec-140\u00b0/sec is a good throw, over 140\u00b0/sec is an over rotation.</p>\n<table class=\"responsive\"><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Characteristic</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Axis</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Peak G Force</td>\n<td>Acceleration</td>\n<td>X</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Rotation</td>\n<td>Sticking</td>\n<td>X &amp; Y</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Straightness</td>\n<td>Accuracy</td>\n<td>Y</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arc</td>\n<td>Loftiness</td>\n<td>Z</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wobble</td>\n<td>Flight Path</td>\n<td>Z</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2>Onwards &amp; Upwards</h2>\n<hr/>\n<p>Performance optimization software like ours can benefit people who have difficulty with fine motor control. Our vision is to excite the passion for social target sports in everyone - especially, those who have a deep desire to improve their throws, from experts to beginners.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_medtbvdFdL1ro2d43.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thank You!</a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><em>\"Remember primal man / who only had his hands / who forged in fire and steel / the tools to kill his meal / we honour him this day / and pray our axe to stay.\"</em></p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to <a href=\"http://batlgrounds.com/axe-throwing-kitchener/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BATL</a> for the support &amp; enthusiasm</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/texas-instruments\">texas-instruments</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/accelerometer\">accelerometer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/genymotion\">genymotion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dxuprog/htnaxe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dxuprog/htnaxe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on design, specifically I created the logo and app icon design, branding and UI design.

Searched online for a similar product, and found none. Since it could not be found on google either, it was assumed that it was not developed yet. Creating a new product no one else in the mainstream media has made yet was enticing </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It generates smoke rings with the beat of the music</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Ripped apart a set of speakers, designed and built a chamber to generate air vortexes. Chamber design took multiple iterations to do. Experimented with different sized and shaped nozzles attached to the fog machine to cool down and slow down the smoke. Connected a raspberry pi 2 to the speaker system, along with an Ethernet cable which played music after filtering out/adding bass and treble. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The air vortex was lot harder to be generated than previously thought. The majority of the time here was spent doing research and development into getting that part of the system to work. The smoke was also very hard to cool and slow down at the same time, given the materials we brought. Many, many iterations and general research had to be done in order for the system to function. This loss in time made it hard to implement the back-end we had originally intended to include, which included a website that allowed for users to choose the next song to be played. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to get the smoke rings to work. In the end, after all our failures, the core proof of concept of our project pulled through.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>About smoke rings:\nSmoke rings are generated best with a 1-5Hz audio signal, and must be a sawtooth wave. Sine and square do not work to generate any smoke rings. The size of the chamber opening, in proportion to the volume displacement factor of the speakers and the size of the chamber matters greatly when it comes to smoke right production. High frequency waves generate a wind-like stream of air, which cannot sustain smoke rings. Hence, the splitting up of song signals had to be done in order to ensure the music AND the rings could be experienced. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Vapour Beat</h2>\n<p>Developing a signal processing program on the raspberry pi, which will be able to automatically split up the audio input into different channels, for better sync and formation of smoke rings. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">raspberry-pi-2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mpc</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend raspberry pi and windows applications that played the music and generate the beats.", "", ""]], ["Project Window", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/139833405?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Window \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/300/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Window \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/737/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As libraries and API's become increasingly powerful we wanted to contribute to those with visual impairments to understand their surroundings</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By pressing anywhere on the screen, the app takes a picture and dictates single words to let the user know what is near them.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to design a product for a market that does not include either of us.

The training and sampling is run on Google Cloud, which granted us 16 cores of computing power. To scrape the Medium content, we used the BeautifulSoup library in Python. \n In order to complete the frontend portion of the app, we created an instance on Linode to support an AngularJS app. The app will communicate to the backend in order to get the relevant data, then display it to the user. In addition, we also made use of Firebase to keep track of the number of times each link is clicked on.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This project was our first foray into machine learning as well as web scraping. Michael and I spent a lot of time pair coding to get all this working. We are very thankful for all the mentorship available at Hack the North, and were helped by engineers from Facebook, Google, Firebase, Indico, Yelp, and Linode. Another challenge that we had is that about 4% of the top Medium content is in Spanish, and this had to be manually filtered out from our training set. Lastly, due to the large computational power necessary to train the recurrent neural network, and the limited time we had, we could not input a very large training set. For the frontend portion, the main challenge was getting the jsonp to accept the file format being passed to it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud to have successfully incorporated recurrent neural networks. We all worked with new technologies that many of us are unfamiliar with, and we still managed to create an MVI.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We've now had our first exposure to different technologies, such as machine learning and web scraping. Aashni learnt a lot about deploying apps onto both Google Cloud and Linode servers.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, Runescape; What do these games have in common? They all take incredible amounts of time to build a successful character with little effect on their real-world counter part, our bodies. To get that legendary sword we need to spend hours upon hours sitting in our computer chairs letting our health suffer, but what if there was another way?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>BITNESS aims to blur the lines between gaming and fitness by motivating users to workout by rewarding them with in game experience to level their 8-bit character. Pairing a Pebble with Focus Motion's movement analysing SDK our app is able to identify the type and repetitions of over 50 different exercises. By exercising the user is able to earn experience points which levels up their character and gives access to new and more interesting wearable items. Designed to be unobtrusive, tracking is triggered and stopped with a flick of the wrist, ideal for gym use in between sets. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team developed a unique app for both the Android platform and Pebble Time. The Android application was developed in Java using Android Studio and Pebble Time app was built using Pebble C SDK. All 8-bit art and graphics were designed using photoshop.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Focus Motion SDK is fairly new to the market and as a consequence there are very few examples and limited documentation on how to use the libraries correctly. Much of our hacking time was spent developing apps to test and learn the SDK before moving forward with BITNESS. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Getting the Focus Motion SDK fully operational despite no existing examples online</li>\n<li>The 8-bit graphic design of both the Pebble and Android UI</li>\n<li>Creating a working app as a team of first time hackers!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned Pebble development, 8-bit graphic design, Android PebbleKit, and how to consume the Focus Motion SDK.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BITNESS</h2>\n<p>The next steps for BITNESS are to build out our core functionalities by adding motion learning algorithms, social media integration, and additional device support. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I developed the pebble application and helped integrate the Focus Motion SDK", "I worked on consuming the FocusMotion SDK using the Pebble and on Android", "I designed the application, including all of the animations!", ""]], ["Furnish It!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Furnish It! \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/122/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Furnish It! \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/123/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Furnish It! \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/124/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Furnish It! \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/125/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Furnish It! \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/126/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Furnish It! \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/127/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Furnish It! \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/128/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As co-op students, we would have to transition from one location to another every four months.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Mobile dating apps have gained massive popularity in the recent years, but not everyone is looking for a blind hookup. Some people people want a more wholesome relationship, and some people want to set up those people. This is where Pear comes in. Pear allows users to suggest whether they think two of their Facebook friends would make a good couple. If this couple gets a minimum number of approvals, the two people involved get notified and can suggest a date! Since your friends suggested the date you'll feel more comfortable meeting up with them since your friends are going to look out for you. This helps you avoid all the creeps! Or look for more than just a hookup.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Pear is an app that allows users to match their friends together in a safe and fun environment. Once paired, users have the option of suggesting a date, time, and location to meet. If accepted, a chatbox opens between the users, which allows them to chat until their date. This system accelerates the decision process and encourages users to take it a step beyond _ just a match _. We hope this will help people who may not normally be forward with others in fear of rejection. But by creating a supportive environment, we hope to help bring those people _ out of their shells _ and try something new.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Flask and Python to run a backend-heavy app in order to minimize the amount of load on the client's side. By using Jinja and Javascript to format the client's interface we easily interfaced with our database to provide a seamless user experience. We used APIs such as Facebook, Firebase, and Google Maps in order to better serve our users in convenience as well as features.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As you may be able to tell from looking at our app, we aren't very good at front-end design, but we are very experienced with back-end development. After spending 6 hours developing the UI/UX we wanted for the app we immediately began working to provide something as similar as possible to our goals. Although it might not have blown away our expectation, we think it definitely meets our minimum standards.</p>\n<p>Our other main challenge was being able to test. Since apps like ours are built on the _ network effect _, running with a small number of users can be tricky. Especially when you have to work through Facebook's approval system in order to get full functionality of the app. However, by persevering and working along side mentors we were able to get everything running despite these setbacks.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of our ability to meet our goals in the front-end design space. Since we didn't have much experience here we were worried heading into something as ambitious as this. However, by spending our first 6 hours figuring out how we wanted people to interact and the feeling they get from the environment, we were able to use our limited knowledge to it's full potential.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our main goal was to learn some front-end design as well as getting comfortable with the APIs we chose. Front-end design is something that we all want to learn how to do in the near future, but never had a good place to start until now. Similarly, we chose powerful APIs that work across a very wide variety of app ideas and by getting comfortable with then now will certainly put us ahead in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pear</h2>\n<p>The next step for Pear is to launch native iOS and Android apps in order to maximize our user base. We chose to launch as a mobile-web app in order to save development time and prove our concept. However, we see a place for Pear in the world and we don't want to stop here. We already have an exit strategy coming out of Hack the North in order to further design and development as quickly as possible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jinja\">jinja</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pearapp.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.pearapp.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.pearapp.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kForth/Pear\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kForth/Pear\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Charm", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Charm \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/519/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Charm \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/520/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Charm \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/521/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Charm \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/522/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We just wanted to enable the suave that exists in everyone.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Provides you with a quick pick-up line to really impress that one special person.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Python + Flask in the backend, Pebble to consume as the frontend</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Hosting on Heroku</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Tbh nothing much, it was pretty run of the mill.

You're stuck with viewing 360 degree videos (which, while amazing, leave you rooted at the center of the action unable to take a single step), or games which auto-walk/run/swim/fly you along. You have no actual control over where you want to go, and games tend to repeat due to the limitations of the cardboard.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Immersion is a multi-staged product. First, is the cardboard, which provides the 3D view we crave. Then, a glove on the right hand to emulate the key features of the mouse - left/right click, up/down scroll. Finally, a tetra-directional floor piece that maintains the illusion of walking.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit, the floor piece is built entirely of cardboard, save for aluminum strips and wires. As you can see from the pictures, the floor piece is made of four ramp-like structures, each with two aluminum strips in the shape of an equals sign, and wires protruding from either the left or right side. The player stands in the center with a special kind of shoes - they need to have a sheet of aluminum foil on it. By utilizing the properties of aluminum, a circuit is completed every step and the low coefficient of friction means it's easy to slide back to where you started.</p>\n<p>The five fingers of the glove is also coated with aluminum. Wires come out the back and down the arm to an Arduino, which is powered using a 9v power cell and communicates with a Bluetooth adapter. The thumb acts as the 'main' finger, that which other fingers must contact to activate their abilities.</p>\n<p>Finally, for PC-based streaming, someone wrote a program called \"Trinus VR\" which works really well, so that's what I ended up using.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It was difficult to find a fitting combination of ramp material, shoe material, and conductive material. Combinations that were scrapped included waxed baking sheets/trash bags and cardboard/cardboard.\nHaving hacked this solo, it was also difficult to stay awake because of all the effort I put into it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm very proud of how the final floor piece turned out. There was a point when I was about to scrap the whole idea of a floor piece but after little bit of calming I decided to take a stab at it again.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was my first hardware hack, and I did a lot of hand-on things. Having only two hands and one occupied in a glove means I needed some creative methods of interacting with everyday objects.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Immersion</h2>\n<p>One thing that I really wanted to do is to have the left hand be able to interact with a mini-keyboard. I envisioned this keyboard to be located on the upper-right arm, like a tube to fit the arm in.\nThe floor piece is also not very precisely done. Most of the materials for that piece was scavenged from recycling bins and so condition wasn't a guarantee.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Finger Lights Web Interface", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Finger Lights Web Interface \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/888/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanted a Minority Report like interface for browsing the web on a computer</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Finger Lights Web Interface</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://kamd.xyz/prof/HTN15/ext/src/browser_action/color_camera.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://kamd.xyz/prof/HTN15/ext/src/browser_action/color_camera.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>kamd.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Stock Overflow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stock Overflow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/496/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stock Overflow \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/339/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stock Overflow \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/140/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stock Overflow \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/141/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stock Overflow \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/142/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stock Overflow \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/143/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Typically spending money results in small amounts of change left over; change that is inconsequential. No one notices if a few cents are missing or not, but by slowly putting that change to use in something like investing in stocks, Bitcoin, or giving to charity, a few cents can very quickly build up to something that makes a difference.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Stock Overflow provides an Android app for users to log into with their PayPal account, and then our server monitors any transactions they make. The \"spare change\" from each transaction is made available to invest in stocks and Bitcoin. The stocks are ranked based on our custom stock prediction algorithm to give the user an idea of where to invest. The app then provides a nice interface for monitoring their investments and what their space change has turned into.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Android app communicates with the server using Firebase. The back-end is developed with node.js and handles all of the PayPal authentication and transaction tracking using the PayPal API and also applies the stock prediction algorithm. The algorithm uses the Google News API to search up recent news articles about each company listed then applies sentiment analysis to the headlines using Indico's natural language processing API to see which companies are getting \"good\" and \"bad\" attention/public sentiment. The sentiment average is then displayed to the user on the app to help them make an investment choice. We pull down real time stock data from Google Finance using a community node scraper that we re-purposed. The Bitcoin exchange rate is obtained on the server using the Coinbase API and is passed to the app which then lists Bitcoin as a special investment option. The Android app then handles purchasing and tracking of stock and Bitcoin.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firebase, PayPal API, Coinbase API, Indico API, Google APIs, Android, node.js, express.js</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We wanted to include Azure machine learning in the stock prediction algorithm but couldn't get very far with it due to time constraints. Another challenge was that some node.js community packages didn't work as advertised, forcing us to make adjustments and find workarounds. Also, many of the APIs that we planned on using (Bloomberg API for stocks, Facebook Graph API for searching for articles, etc) were not providing the functionality we needed, so we had to investigate other options, while some of the others that we did use limited the extent to which we could put the API to use, which again caused us to reconsider our design and how to approach creating our proof of concept.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Successfully designing the entire application and dividing it up into modules between team members, and having them merge together (surprisingly) nicely at the end</li>\n<li>Quickly finding alternatives every time we seemed to hit a dead end with an API (which happened a lot... Bloomberg, Facebook Graph, Coinbase...) instead of getting caught up on these road bumps</li>\n<li>Mashing together more APIs that we can count and making it work!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all gained experience in some previously unexplored fields. All of us came in with different experience and by hacking together we not only learned a lot from our research and experimentation, but also from each other. Specific topics that some of us learned about are Node.js, server communication, Android UI design, and how to figure out a lot of APIs and very little time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Stock Overflow</h2>\n<p>Sleep. And expanding on existing features! Right now the application is really just a proof of concept; it has the fundamental setup but leaves a lot of room for expansion. From customizing how your budget is calculated (Round to nearest cent? Round to nearest 10? 1% of transaction?), to where the money can be spent (Charity, stocks, etc), to analyzing and improving our stock prediction algorithm. There was slight influence on the stock prediction algorithm using Azure machine learning but due to time constraints we couldn't get very far with it so we pulled it out for now. Working with Azure is definitely part of the plan for the future. Overall, there's a lot more we could do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/paypal\">paypal</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coinbase\">coinbase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/irfansharif/stock-overflow-server\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/irfansharif/stock-overflow-server\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/irfansharif/stock-overflow-android\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/irfansharif/stock-overflow-android\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I contributed mainly to the android application.

As well as commenting on individual websites along the path, users can 'fork' of at any point and share their own branching explorations.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Rabbit Hole can be divided into 3 components.</p>\n<p>1) A single page web application programmed using Angular.js that allows users to explore and comment on the rabbit holes shared by users.</p>\n<p>2) A chrome extension that utilizes the Chrome History API to allow users to create rabbit holes.</p>\n<p>3) A Python/Flask server connected to a PostgreSQL database which handles both the storage of rabbit holes and a similarity ranking algorithm using indicoio NLP to automatically determine the optimal length for each rabbit hole.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indicoio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://rabbitapp.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://rabbitapp.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rabbitapp.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["gon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gon \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/687/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gon \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/529/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"gon \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/553/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>gon - Hack the North 2015</h1>\n<p>gon, a play on words for \"go on\" and \"gone\", is a useful Android application for event--planning! gon utilizes the Facebook API for easy login and importing of upcoming Facebook and personal events.

The app on your phone also integrates with a website, allowing you to create your own waypoints for others to interact with.

While Peter worked with Android Studio and a diverse collection of libraries to develop the GeoConnect mobile application, Kevin and Curtis took on the website, utilizing the LAMP stack to communicate with their share of third party APIs and databases. Both teams coordinated their efforts in order to satisfy the end requirements.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>While developing GeoConnect, the team faced 36 sleepless hours of bug-filled development and an endless supply of energy drinks.

Kevin seemed to constantly find spelling errors in variables and functions throughout the site's back-end.

A kid in grade 8 built a prosthetic hand that you could control with your other hand. This didn't make any sense to me - you just get one prosthetic hand instead of one real hand and a prosthetic one. This idea got me started thinking about other ways you can control prosthetic hands.</p>\n<p>Implanted prosthetic hands are obviously the best way to go. They work by connecting electrodes to nerves via surgery, very similar to a real hand. However, it's incredibly expensive. Surface electrodes work for below elbow prosthetic hands, but if you also have a prosthetic forearm this can obviously not work.</p>\n<p>So, I asked the question: how can we control prosthetic hands in an affordable way that doesn't require the loss of other bodily functions (using another hand).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Muse grip is a system that listens to jaw clench patterns and translates them into the clenching and releasing of a prosthetic hand.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built muse grip using a muse for detection of jaw clenches, a python backend for analysis of muse data and communication between muse and arduino, and an arduino with 3 servos as the prosthetic hand.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h3>Software</h3>\n<p>Immediately, there were issues with communicating with the muse to get any data at all. There is no supported python library for muse, so I had to write my own workaround. Further, cleansing the data to get rid of false positives was quite difficult - often muse throws a 0 in the middle of a bunch of 1s and tries to mess everything up. Finally, communicating between python and arduino is generally undocumented, so I had to realize that serial communication requires bytes of an iterable (took some time to realize this).</p>\n<h3>Hardware</h3>\n<p>I had never used servos prior to this, so using a servo was a completely new experience to me. Building a claw that could actually pick things up is quite difficult, I had issues with knex not being stable enough. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of my reverse engineering of the muse - I looked at the data that the muse outputs to supported libraries and created my own in an unsupported environment, just throwing data at the muse until I was able to figure out some kind of understanding. I'm also proud of the pattern recognition algorithm, I think it's pretty awesome with user input.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that hardware hacks have a lot more issues than software hacks. Sometimes it feels like entire projects are falling apart, and that's incredibly unsettling. I learned to persevere and I got a product I'm happy with at the end!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Muse Grip</h2>\n<p>Next for muse grip is taking the code and porting it to a 3D printed prosthetic hand, such that we could have more realistic gripping for human interaction.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">knex</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">osc</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.musegrip.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.musegrip.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.musegrip.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/johnafish/Muse-Grip\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/johnafish/Muse-Grip\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I soloed this project!

Unfortuantely, this means a lot of back and forth for our users. We wanted to make a seamless and enjoyable experience for using apps and automating homes, so we created Auxiliator.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Auxiliator is your own personal assistant. With just a single voice command, you have complete access to many apps and services. For example, want to pay your friend $10 for dinner? Simply tell Auxiliator to pay your friend and you're done. Want to book an Uber? Just tell Auxiliator to call you an Uber. Want to turn your bedroom lights on and off? How about open and close your blinds? Want to know the weather outside? All you have to do is ask.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This project was built using many different technologies. We implemented a LAMP stack for our backend server and web client. We also built an Android app that allows users to talk to Auxiliator on the go. The backend server is the most important component as all the voice commands go through it. Whether on Pebble, or Android or desktop web - all voice commands get processed by the server. In addition to the software side of things, we also built hardware to turn lights on and off as well as open and close blinds.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many challenges connecting all the clients in this ecosystem. We had to connect smartwatches to smartphones to the server and finally to the microprocessor that runs the hardware components. Getting this flow to be fast, efficient and reliable was a big challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud that we got a MVP version built. Our minimum viable product is fully functional and features both an android app and a website that are able to listen to your commands and process your requests.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about building a system of clients and servers and how intersystem communication works. We also learned how to work together as a team, parallelizing tasks to accomplish as much as possible in a low amount of time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project Auxiliator - the most personal personal helper</h2>\n<p>We plan to continue implementing integrations for Auxiliator.

What if we could incorporate pronunciation information in realtime to eliminate these errors?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Keytar is a proof-of-concept touch keyboard that integrates speech recognition with swiping in realtime.</p>\n<p>The user swipes to enter words, similar to Swype or Google Keyboard. However, as they are swiping, the user also says the word out loud. Voice recognition is performed on the speech, and the swipe and voice information is put together to get very high quality results.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>About a year ago, I wrote a library called speech_recognition, which now has many tens of thousands of active users. This provides the speech side of things.</p>\n<p>The swipe keyboard demo is written using Python and PyGame. Polling the touch position, we get the trail left behind by the finger. This information is used by a ranking function and an English word list to get the most likely words intended by the user.</p>\n<p>Speech recognition is constantly running while the keyboard is active. The results are merged with recently swiped words. That means that speaking can be used to correct the most recently typed word.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This keyboard is intended for use with mobile phones. For simplicity and ease of development/testing, I chose to make a desktop app.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the API-based speech recognition is a bit too slow to match real-world typing speeds, especially on the WiFi in E5. To solve this, I would swap it out for something like PocketSphinx, which has no dependency on network speeds.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The language model is really simple, but it works surprisingly well. Words are scored by their log combined rank and length, and voice and typing are resolved in a really elegant way.</p>\n<p>As a proof of concept, I feel that the idea is demonstrated quite well.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I've never used PyGame for this sort of thing before - it's quite nice to work with! Figuring out how swipe-style keyboards work was also very interesting, and my algorithm is likely very different from what currently available swipe keyboards use.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Keytar</h2>\n<p>First, I'd like to try using something like PocketSphinx to make the speech recognition faster.</p>\n<p>Then, an improved swipe model is in order. For example, the length of the path that goes through the key, and sudden changes in the swipe direction, should be taken into account.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pygame\">pygame</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">speech-recognition</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-speech-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Uberi/keytar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Uberi/keytar\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["BlueBalls", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We lost a lot of golf balls when we were young.

With universities such as McMaster, there are entire groups dedicated to finding a suitable roommate, and even then, ads are often lost in the sea of people looking for someone to live with.</h2>\n<h2>What it does: With 'Roomies', simply type in what you are looking for, and using our searching algorithm, we will sort it and pull up the best matches for the criteria you have searched for.</h2>\n<h2>How I built it: There were two directions we started with this application: the front end and back end code, and we eventually met in the middle. What I was responsible for was the front end, involving the CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML. This started off by first creating a skeleton site, and later filling it in with Facebook authorization. Once this was done, the next part was setting up the site to accommodate the information that would later be pulled from the Facebook API.</h2>\n<p>The back end was done on Microsoft Azure, where the database was created to store all the information that was pulled from Facebook, as well as to host the site. Darryl first learned about the back end that was necessary to implement these features, and once he had completed this, he proceeded to figure out the exact path he would need to follow to get all the information necessary from Facebook for our application and how to pass this information from the front and back.</p>\n<p>The 'middle' process involved the mathematical calculation of finding the best match based on user defined preferences. David started off with a class file for the people object with constructor of information that he would pull off of Facebook, and then proceeded to make functions for information the user would themselves. His process for finding the best match involved assigning values to find the profile of the best matches with a linear scale towards accounts with similar ratings toward the user, and an exponential scale towards ratings that the user acquired from previous clients.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into: Some of the challenges we ran into was the constant flow of information to the server as simple errors would cause the entire program to crash. There were also issues with communicating between the front and back end as these two programs were done simultaneously, and certain things were not taken into account into much later, such as passing the information the user has entered to the back end, and the matches back to the front end. In addition to this, while we got a sorting algorithm that mainly worked, there were a few glitches which we were not able to solve, and in doing so, we hard coded in matches to solve this problem.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of: One of the things I am personally proud of is the front end design, as it is the first time I've designed a fully functional front end website which has access to back end codes.</h2>\n<p>Darryl is proud of learning a new language and producing a product within a tight time frame as it provided a variety of problems along.</p>\n<p>David is proud of contributing a significant part of the program which involved a complex mathematical algorithm and models to provide accurate data to help find the closest match. </p>\n<h2>What I learned: I learned that I enjoy front end programming and possibly would like to continue this in the future.</h2>\n<p>Darryl learned that php and skills required in project management, and working in a team. David learned that he enjoys the math and logic behind programming.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Roomies: The first thing we definitely would like to implement is a proper sorting algorithm for the program. In the future we would like to implement a 'swipe right for accept, and left for decline', rating by mutual friends for reassurance, not letting the user view more possible roommates until they pay or rate prior roommates. There should also be a more refined location services to provide more accurate data, as well as more fields for the users to users to specify such as budget, fields of interest, and areas of study, ect. We would also like to build in an in-app messaging system to allow for them to chat, and possibly use that to accept/decline roommates.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://roomiesonline.azurewebsites.net/roomies/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://roomiesonline.azurewebsites.net/roomies/index.php\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>roomiesonline.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/drock371/roomie\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/drock371/roomie\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["What I was responsible for was the front end, involving the CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML.

For years I have dreamed of owning my own drone to control and capture these amazing shots. The current cost of a commercial product that is capable of either carrying a recording device or has one built in is out of most people's budget and thus my inspiration was found. This copter is built completely from scratch using original ideas</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Currently it can stay in the air for a bit but the messy auto-stabilization still can need work. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The frame is 3D printed using PLA motors and speed controllers were all purchased and the flight control system is done by the arduino and a wireless chip</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Many many challenges. First and foremost is the difficult nature of brushless motors. They require ESCs to drive and these are programmable chips without much input options. The ESCs didn't have much documentation and lots of trial and error was required.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>That the drone can sustain its own weight. Even though it is not stabilized, it is fully capable of supporting its weight and with a bit more of work, it can definitely compare with commercial grade drone.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Everything can go wrong and usually will go wrong. Just about every part I've used experienced trouble sooner or later and time must be allotted for unforeseen troubles. I spent 2 hours debugging my entire system just because of a defective alligator cable. When does that ever happen? </p>\n<h2>What's next for Fly Away</h2>\n<p>I will develop a full stabilization and flight control system with perhaps enough lift to carry a recording device to capture aerial shots that I have always been a fan of.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this will open doors to more projects and adventures since there is always so much fun and energy in actually making something.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printer</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">brushless-motors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electronic-speed-controllers</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">propellers</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Just about everything"]], ["PetPebble", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make an app that lets you know who is around you, especially in the office.
