[["Matthews Crossing Data Manager", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When we heard what Matthew's Crossing was doing in the community, and what they needed to help achieve that goal, not only did we find it a worthy cause, but we knew that their problems were ones we could solve effectively and quickly. Matthew's Crossing not only wanted a solution, but they had a well-defined idea of what their problem was. The limited scope and high impact of bringing their donation tracking system into the 21st century piqued our interest, as we saw that we could use our efforts most effectively to provide Matthew's Crossing, and the community it serves, with a complete solution that everyone can benefit from.</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>Our solution, Matthew's Crossing Data Manager (MCDM), works in conjunction with their main system, Food Bank Manager. It drastically reduces the number of steps needed for volunteers to track incoming donations and act on that data. MCDM eliminates much of the antiquated paperwork still involved in getting donation information from pickup points to a computer. By bringing what was previously paper-based reporting to a flexible and easy-to-use web platform, less volunteer hours are spent on tracking donations. In addition to the logistical side, MCDM has the capability to automate the process of e-mailing thank-yous and news to donors, which currently requires manual intervention. We were unable to access Matthew's Crossing's email system, but we created a sample system that can be implemented at their choice. Finally, we are able to offer Matthew's Crossing direct financial savings, by integrating with PayPal to offer them all the functionality of their current donation system with significantly lower fees.</p>\n<p>(Red shows monetary donation information flow, black otherwise)</p>\n<h3>Old data flow</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Old Path\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/q7TTxlR.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--SbhHzZci--/http://i.imgur.com/q7TTxlR.png\"/></p>\n<p>(Red shows monetary donation information flow, black otherwise)</p>\n<h3>Data Flow with Matthews Crossing Data Manager</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"New Path\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/X796rEo.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--zM0p4Tqu--/http://i.imgur.com/X796rEo.png\"/></p>\n<p>Looking at these two flowcharts, you can see the difference MCDM makes in streamlining the process of getting information where it needs to be. We eliminate almost all of the human interaction points in the data's path, reducing errors and allowing the limited staff to dedicate more of their valuable time to what matters most: helping the 623,300 people in Maricopa County who don't always know where their next meal is going to come from.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>The backend of Matthew's Crossing Data Manager is built from mostly in PHP, with components built in Python; the frontend is built from fairly standard web technologies: HTML, CSS3, and JavaScript. We were also able to leverage an existing open-source web framework to cut down on development time while providing better functionality. The work was distributed into 4 major components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Interface with Food Bank Manager</li>\n<li>The Monetary Donation Chain</li>\n<li>The Bulk Donation Chain (Including food donations)</li>\n<li>The Email and Mail Merge Chain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These components were developed separately and simultaneously, and integrated at multiple points during development.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>The lack of long-term technical skill limited the technical complexity of the solution we could put in place. An additional with finding the right scope and extracting the real core problems not their perceived solutions on the art of our nonprofit.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That I'm Proud Of</h2>\n<p>Mark: The length of this hackathon was much shorter than the ones I am used to, forcing some tough choices in regards to feature sets. I'm proud to have produced the solution that we did on the shortened timescale we had.</p>\n<p>James: I faced a good bit of challenge in transforming our ideas into reality in such a short amount of time, so I'm very happy to have held to my standard of quality in creating MCDM. I feel that's it's really something that people in the community can see a benefit from, especially those volunteering at Matthew's Crossing. I feel my biggest accomplishment was seamlessly integrating two-factor authentication with the authentication framework we used.</p>\n<p>Jisung: This is the first time I attended a hackathon. As a freshman who is new to programming, I thought a hackathon would be difficult and, and that it's not for students who are new to programming. However, thanks to my team, I was able to learn HTML and apply the concepts I taught myself to the software we were making. Although the page that I created looks unappealing, I am proud that I've managed to create a page using HTML without knowing a lot of information about it. I am also proud to have joined this team, because as a person who is new to programming, I wouldn't have learned anything in this event if the team I joined wasn't encouraging me to participate. However, my team was very encouraging, answered all the questions I had, and gave me an opportunity to participate.</p>\n<h2>What I Learned</h2>\n<p>The original AWS Elastic Beanstalk/Lambda powered solution we came up with, while a great solution from a technical standpoint, was not really a sustainable solution for a small nonprofit with low technical skill. So, we changed to a more traditional setup with a basic standalone server, which we believe will be a much easier environment to maintain in the long run for them.\nWe also experienced many challenges in implementing our two-factor authentication system, primarily disagreeing algorithms, but in the end we were able to bring it together in a functional and pleasant solution.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for Matthew's Crossing Data Manager</h2>\n<p>Going forward, we will be working with Matthew's Crossing to more fully integrate with their systems and migrate the software to their servers. We will also be ensuring that they are satisfied with our solution, and that it does in fact solve their problem.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-AZ/Matthews-Crossing-data-managner\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-AZ/Matthews-Crossing-data-managner\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the frontend and upgraded the security of the framework we used; additionally, I wrote portions of the backend.", "", ""]], ["Team#12", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Help the \" Food for hunger\" organization to automate and ease the process of signing , maintaining, analyzing their data. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Automates the otherwise required manual entry of Volunteer Registration, maintain, analyse and visualize the report management.

We wanted to create a solution for an operating system that can be installed on old, recycled and refurbished computers that will be donated to title I schools and 501(3)s.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When you install an operating system such as Ubuntu, you download a ISO file, which contains an image of a minimal working system. Our image contains a couple of modifications, which make setting up computers for schools significantly simpler.</p>\n<p>This image is bundled with Google Chrome (64 bit), or Chromium (32 bit). With Google Apps for Education integrated into the technological backbone of many schools, Google Chrome is the perfect browser for accessing these vital tools for success.</p>\n<p>This image is also bundled with a basic antivirus, designed to patch vulnerabilities in the operating system before software is corrected.</p>\n<p>We also installed bleachbit, a tool to help you clean a system's hard drive and rid it of unnecessary temporary files.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used a software called Cubic to set up the environment to allow us to run commands within the live CD filesystem. After the installation of the software, we generated the ISO file and burned it to a flash drive.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We were unsure of the scope of the project and thus delegation of work between members of the team was very inefficient, sometimes impossible.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We rolled together our own Ubuntu distribution ISO that allows us to create an identical installation on multiple computers without the use of images, which are slow by nature.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to generate a custom image for a Live OS, in this case, Ubuntu. I also learned how to flash the image onto a USB drive, make it bootable and then install Ubuntu from it. I also learned how to package some legacy wireless drivers with the boot disk.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ubuntu for Students</h2>\n<p>Now, we need to deploy this to as many computers as possible.

This app would parallel the already existing website and highlight the most important parts, making it easy for people to find what they need. Second, we wrote a list of instructions on how to use Remind, a service that allows sending text messages to large groups of people all at once. This will allow the Chandler Christian Community Center to use its already existing database of phone numbers to reach out to its volunteers and donors in a more efficient manner than email. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the app using Android Studio. This meant coding both in Java and XML. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were numerous challenges that we ran into during the course of this process. As it was our first Hackathon and our first time making an app in Android, we had very little idea of what to do in the beginning.

Other problems we faced were formatting and optimizing the app at the end. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud of the fact that we overcame many obstacles and gave solving the problem our best shot.

As part of Opportunity Hack '16, our team sought out to ease this process by developing a web app &amp; QR code mobile app, which the employees at Crisis Centre could use to manage their stock.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The web application we developed gives an overview of the current stocks of categories of donations. It alerts the admin and concerned employees when the stock level for a category of items (diapers for example) goes below a threshold value. It also has a tab where employees can add/modify the stock for a particular item.  The categories of items, threshold stock values,etc. are all customizable by the admin.\n We also built an iOS app with an inbuilt QR code scanner, using which employees can simply scan a donation item to add/update it in the main database. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We used MySQL to set up the main database &amp; hosted it on an AWS server, with the backend written in C#. </li>\n<li>The front-end was written using HTML, CSS and Razor. </li>\n<li>The mobile app used the standard native iOS-SDK, along with integration with a third party open-source library (<a href=\"https://github.com/yannickl/QRCodeReaderViewController\" rel=\"nofollow\">QRCodeReaderViewController</a>) to scan QR codes. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We did face some issues with the initial setup of the project, since not everyone was familiar with the technology    stack. </li>\n<li>Time management was also a big challenge, as we had to implement a large number of features in less than 30 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We came up with a working product with a complex set of requirements in less than 30 hours.</li>\n<li>We came together as a team and pooled our skills to come up with a viable solution, despite most of us never having met each other before the hackathon. </li>\n<li>Our product can significantly ease the donation management for Child Crisis Arizona, an NGO who's cause we identified with. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li> Back end and front end web development using HTML, CSS, C#.</li>\n<li> MySQL, iOS Development</li>\n<li> Take a pillow with you to hackathons :)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The application &amp; database needs to be migrated to and hosted on a server accessible to Child Crisis. </li>\n<li>Integration with Child Crisis Arizona's existing user accounts for security would need to be looked into. </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">razor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-AZ/Team11.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-AZ/Team11.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the database schema and implementation in MySQL.
