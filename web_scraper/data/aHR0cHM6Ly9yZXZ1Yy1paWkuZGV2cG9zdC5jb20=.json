From there, we made a C# program that listens for input when you press a button. It listens for whatever language you choose in the program, parses it into text, then sends it off to be translated to whatever language is your native tongue. It is then displayed in a style similar to subtitles in a movie.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was my first time making a Windows 8 Store App. I had never worked with XAML before and there were some quirks with getting the webcam to work.  Additionally, Richard had done very little programming with an Oculus Rift or Windows Store Applications, so this was his first major foray into development using these technologies.  However, we made sure to get help from others and search diligently to find what we needed to do.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about XAML, Richard learned a lot about programming in a hackathon setting, and I learned a fair amount about Speech Recognition and Translation APIs by Bing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Convox</h2>\n<p>The next step for Convox would be to dabble into OCR and translate written foreign words into your native tongue.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xaml\">xaml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/net\">.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing\">bing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-translator\">bing-translator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Moocher", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Moocher \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/263/015/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When looking for an idea, our team realized that there was one thing no one disliked -- Free stuff! Unfortunately, with all the stuff that is given out by companies on college campuses and at hackathons, it's hard to keep track of what's happening when. We decided to make a social tool in order to help our users keep up to date on all the latest promotions in the area.</p>\n<p>As the project grew, we realized it had many other applications. Our project became a bit like a public billboard: you could post things for all to see about what was going on in the area in a very specific place. We hope that the project can help bring people together and make it easier for people to enjoy things happening at any given time in any given area.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We wanted our app to be simple, so after signing in, you are immediately brought to a map of your surroundings. From here you can investigate what other people have found in the area, or even create a new \"shout\" at your current location for everyone else to see. From here, people can gather and take advantage of obscure opportunities, or just spend time getting to know each other better.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenges our team faced were with the technologies we worked with. We decided we were all going to work with something we weren't familiar with. As a result, each one of us was able to pick up a new skill over the weekend. Not only that, we each did a pretty good job polishing our individual parts and tying them all together.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Several of us worked with tools that we had never worked with before, so it was a chance to gain a new skill, programming-wise. For some of us, it was our first successful hackathon, and we were able to walk away with something we had created and could call our own.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>In addition to learning completely new platforms, we learned a lot about actually creating a piece of software that could go into production. About halfway through, we felt like we were well on track to finish on time, but by the time the last couple hours came around, we still had some details to iron out. It just goes to show that you always need to budget your time better than you think you have.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Moocher</h2>\n<p>We think Moocher has some real potential to help create new social environments and encourage more get-togethers, or at the very least interesting interactions, for people of all different ages and backgrounds. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lufinkey/Moocher\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lufinkey/Moocher\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on the iOS app that served as the main front end (along with android) for our service.", "I helped work on the android app that was a front end for our service.", "I worked on the backend of Moocher.

With the Mobile Education Hub, teachers can carry with them not only the training programs they received at the conference, but also extra lessons they can view on their own time as well as potential lesson plans they can use to teach others at home.

I'm sure we all have been to countless numbers of parties or get togethers in which the DJ just doesn't get it. Shouldn't everyone be able to come to a general consensus on what we should listen to?</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>PartyNow utilizes the Spotify Android SDK and Web API. A user has the option to either host a party of join a party. If the user hosts a party then a queue of music is hosted on the phone of the host, and music is played from his device. Other users can then join the party he has started, where they will get access to the queue of music that is being hosted. Here's where the crowd sourced DJing comes in! You can then up vote songs to the top of queue depending on what music you like, meaning good music for all!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Using web sockets was slightly new to this group, which came as a challenge at times. The Spotify SDK and API is only in Beta as well so it is not the best documented, which always bring a challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The fact that we have a working app the connects people through common tastes in music in realtime!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The experience that we got with Android apps that connect to a backend and web sockets is pretty valuable</p>\n<h2>What's next for PartyNow</h2>\n<p>The next step for PartyNow is to make a web app and iOS app, which shouldn't be hard as everything will use the same backend</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spotify\">spotify</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["PyGameProject2015", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PyGameProject2015 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/263/090/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Love retro gaming and love programming!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Usage of PyGame with Python 3.2 using custom sprites etc.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting a good internal code structure, configuring ai, and making animations</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Building it up from scratch and home-brewing 99% of its contents</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to program in python, game dev, and what hackathons are like!</p>\n<h2>What's next for PyGameProject2015</h2>\n<p>Possibly build upon, improving graphics (resolution and sprites), adding maps, enemies, or rebuilding altogether.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pygame\">pygame</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B_Mt6lruxuNmfkc0OVlaRjBfZEFwVTdVdm01SXA2RWI2cVZXSnJiVVo4THpQM0hLYUVXU3c/0B_Mt6lruxuNmfjYzWEhZaUkzY19RSXlGZGtaMWt3cU9XRGZQX01yN2JjTkVDb1NpcDc5RGM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0B_Mt6lruxuNmfkc0OVlaRjBfZEFwVTdVdm01SXA2RWI2cVZXSnJiVVo4THpQM0hLYUVXU3c/0B_Mt6lruxuNmfjYzWEhZaUkzY19RSXlGZGtaMWt3cU9XRGZQX01yN2JjTkVDb1NpcDc5RGM\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]]]
