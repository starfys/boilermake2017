My team and I found this especially troubling when we realized the multitude of simple ways that people could contribute. Of those consisted of local businesses that partner up with charities to create \"charity deals\", or a product or service, that upon purchase, will allow the business to donate a certain portion of proceeds to their partnering charity. Charity deals often allow the individual to support a cause without directly spending extra money or time to do so. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application, \"Charity On Top\", helps connect individuals with local businesses that offer charity deals. \"Charity On Top\" tracks the individual's location and helps locate nearby do-good businesses around them. Individuals can also look up businesses based on the product or service they are looking for, or look up a certain cause that they are particularly passionate about, and the application will provide them with nearby businesses that provide said services or products, or are partnered with said charities. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This app was built with the goal of looking like a mobile application so the html/css styling and layout are fit for the dimensions of a smartphone (around 750 X 1300pixels). However given the limited time and knowledge we built the application using HTML/CSS and Javascript with a few APIs like Google Maps and Google Spreadsheets. The data for each charity deal\u2019s business partner, charity partner, business location and other information is stored in a google spreadsheet. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating a way for the customer to click on a specific business and see more information pop up about the charity deal it is offering.\nImplementing current location because of privacy settings.\nToo much work to do not enough time to do it!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Google APIs like Google Maps and Google Spreadsheets. It was actually less complicated than we thought it would be.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Charity On Top</h2>\n<p>In the future, we hope to expand the reach of \u201cCharity On Top\u201d from our local community to larger cities and eventually nation-wide. Through this application, we hope to make charitable giving a regular part of every individual\u2019s lives by emphasizing that supporting a cause does not need to be time consuming or expensive. \u201cCharity On Top\u201d will most likely also encourage businesses to create partnerships with charities, creating an interconnected network not only within a community, but also across the globe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-spreadsheets\">google-spreadsheets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/KatiaVi/CharityOnTop.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/KatiaVi/CharityOnTop.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the index, search, and welcome pages.

In local communities, lack of conversation is preventing action and growth, meanwhile increasing violence and other problems. Even more, the conversations that are occurring are often filtered, one sided, or fail to provide an accurate representation of the entire community, so we want to fix that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sharon is an automated SMS messaging robot that allows users within the same zipcode to discuss important topics in their community, such as politics and volunteering opportunities, in a safe and anonymous way. Sharon responds to keyword texts like these by providing website links that help the user create chat rooms, petitions, or polls online. Then, the user sends their creation\u2019s link back to Sharon, who then sends it out to everyone in their zip code. Further, Sharon responds to the keyword \u201ccall\u201d by providing the user with information about their senators and representative so that they have the ability to contact their local politician and create changes in their community, inspired by the conversations that take place.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>To make this product, we developed an Outlook add-in that instructs the user on how to begin receiving Sharon\u2019s messages by emailing her their phone number and zip code. These are stored in the user\u2019s contact information. Once she has all the necessary information, Sharon initiates a text conversation with the user and automatically responds to keywords in their texts, like \u201cchat\u201d, \u201cpetition\u201d and \u201cpoll\u201d. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The program was marked as spam to start, and the new line line feed caused errors when Sharon read the texts and emails. Also, we could not figure out how to make the program reply to the message instead of creating a new conversation.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use C#, trim strings to remove the new line line feed, and create Outlook add-ins.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sharon</h2>\n<p>We want to partner with advertisers, make Sharon more efficient and effective, and add more functionality with things like event reminders.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/outlook\">outlook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">addin</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sms</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/katm10/sharon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/katm10/sharon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sharontherobot.squarespace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sharontherobot.squarespace.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sharontherobot.squarespace.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b1ecxPG-xmhGT8I_f3uFRQ5tX1l4KbTbs0MzYYpF47Q/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b1ecxPG-xmhGT8I_f3uFRQ5tX1l4KbTbs0MzYYpF47Q/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the program.\n", "", ""]], ["Animalio", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Animalio</h1>\n<p>This is for the We Hack Too Hackathon.

With schools, colleges, and even grad school, we have attempted to solve this issue; Yet, it stays unresolved. After having seen our own family members suffer from their ability to manage money, we have realized that money management skills must be taught at a young age. We need to teach the young how to manage their money\u2014and giving allowances are clearly not doing the job. With the app, Dough Nut, young adults would be motivated to spend less and save more; and in the process they would learn to manage their money effectively. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>How we do it?</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Dough Nut--an app built using Android Studio and Java--will provide young adults the incentive to spend less money, thus save more. With rewards, avatars, and amazing new accessories, young adults would be drawn to this app, as they are to apps such as Plant Nanny. \n</code></pre>\n<p>With a set budget, Dough Nut will be able to figure out the amount saved each week and use that to give the users donuts. These donuts could then be used to buy and accessorize avatars as well as pets. For the app to find the savings, the users would need to simply take a picture of their receipt through the app camera. The total amount spent will be detected and subtracted from the budget amount to find the savings. Data from the receipt will also be extracted and organized into categories such as Groceries, Entertainment, Clothes, Gas, and Other. This would keep a neat record of money spent and allow the consumers to view the amount they spent under each category. </p>\n<h2>Consumer Benefits</h2>\n<p>Who would have thought saving money could have more rewards than just the money itself? Well, there you have it. For every penny you save, you are now getting donuts! Well, donuts that you can use to not only buy but also accessorize avatars and pets! That\u2019s not the only reward you get, though; now they also have a better chance to get that XBox, or new TV set, or whatever else was on that wishlist. With the evidence all saved on the tips of your finger, you can now show your parents the amount you\u2019ve been saving and the responsible manner by which you\u2019re handling money, to get that which you would love to have.</p>\n<p>With this app, young adults would learn to manage their money in a fun, exciting environment, and thus, be spending less money. With the young spending less money, parents now get to have much more savings than usual. Not only is there more money in your hands, now you can also see where the allowance money goes. The organized charts would show parents \u2026. And allow them to set their kid\u2019s budget accordingly. </p>\n<p>Now, saving money is just one click away.</p>\n<h2>Competition</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>There are a few apps released like Quick Money Recorder and Goodbudget that allow people to keep track of their budgets; However, they are quite hard to navigate, require a lot of input from consumers, and do not educate young adults regarding expense management. Dough Nut is designed to have a user friendly layout that is easy to navigate. There seem to be no apps that encourage responsible money spending. Dough Nut may even have positive effects on the economy as people save more money.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Growth</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>There is so much more that can be done with this project. To gain and keep customers, constant updates would be added with new features such as rewards, badges, as well as social media integration. For further advancements, a parent log in could also be created. This would connect the child\u2019s account to the parent\u2019s so that the parent could set the budget and manage their child\u2019s spendings. To increase the market audience from parents and young adults to other adults as well as to provide more features for the parents, we could add features to help parents track and save their receipts for tax compilations. \n</code></pre>\n<p>To expand on the expense management lesson for young adults, we could add push notifications as well as short lessons on the importance of money savings and other interactive activities on the young adult accounts.\n    We could also partner with Kiva or Robinhood to add investment options onto our app. The user could be suggested to make an investment based on their savings amount. We may even reach out to banks.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Developing this app did not come out to be very easy. We had to overcome quite a few challenges. We used a Microsoft Oxford Computer Vision API for the text recognition feature of our app to allow the data to be extracted. The name pretty much sums up the complexity of this API. Integrating the Computer Vision API into our app and creating an algorithm to interpret its data was one of the hardest tasks involved in developing this app. Saving images into a gallery was, well, another hurdle we are yet to overcome.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Dough Nut Developers &amp; Designers</h2>\n<p>Emily O\u2019Neil, Rose Garcia, Anisha Jain</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li><li></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Anisha%20jain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=Anisha%20jain\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>play.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ai2LGbMoJOPdgZ98ybaQAR7KroSokw\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ai2LGbMoJOPdgZ98ybaQAR7KroSokw\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>1drv.ms</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Microsoft's Computer Vision API's.", "I worked on creating the code to assemble the app based on the design that had been made as well as the logic behind it (all Java).", "I worked on the product management side, looking at features and the target market.

We wanted to increase participation and interaction in urban communities, and foster a sense of belonging. We aim to connect people by helping them help others. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Enter TasCart, which was created in 2016 as a tool to foster genuine connections between members of a community, specifically in large urban centers. The nature of our living structure has isolated us to a point where neighbors often don\u2019t know each other\u2019s names. TasCart responds to this problem by encouraging members of a community to help each other in small but meaningful ways.  Designed as a network to connect people who need help with those who can provide help, the service provided is an online facilitated forum where users can post requests for small tasks--for example, picking up some extra items when grocery shopping--which is accepted for either negotiated prices, pro bono, or community service hour allocations. Overall, TasCart is a powerful tool for meeting those around us and finding serendipity in the small stuff in life.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The database component of TasCart was made using Express.js and MongoDB in conjunction with jQuery to allow for basic interactions with the database.  A static version of the site (protoype) was also created.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>None of our team members have ever participated in a Hackathon before, and all of us could be considered fairly new to code.  None of us had experience with back-end web development either, meaning that we had to learn almost everything from scratch.

(Ms. Mayer did not say any of this and is not a deliverer, only an example)</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> It started off with our want to bring a community closer together. When we think of a community, we think of our neighbors, but many of us don't even know our neighbors. They're strangers to us and it gets to a point in which we even start to distrust the very people around us, but we like to believe that there's good in people and that we are in this world to help each other. Vicinia offers a platform for neighbors to help each other out on both ends of the deal. A person can deliver goods to their neighbor and earn some extra money by doing so. So who benefits? Well the buyer benefits because they do not have to leave their home to go grocery shopping, which for some people can be extremely difficult, such as the disabled, injured, or elderly. The deliverer benefits because they can make some money, creating a source of economic stability for individuals in tough financial situations who cannot find a job. It is also appealing to college students who may need a source of income but do not have the time for a full-time job. Using Vicinia, the deliverer is able to create their own work schedule, giving them the freedom to work at their own pace. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Vicinia allows people to order goods from their local big retail stores, or even their local businesses, if they are partnered with Vicinia (which we plan on making very easy to do), all from their electronic device. There are limitations as to what the individual can buy, for example we do not expect Vicinia drivers to deliver a refrigerator or TV, in fact it is not an option on the app. Only goods that can be transported in a car can be delivered. Once the buyer fills up their online cart, they can choose a date and time for delivery, as well as location. Based on this information, a list of available deliverers will show up for the buyer. The buyer can then choose a deliverer from the list, this way they can know exactly who is coming to their door. In addition to seeing their picture, buyers will also be able to see reviews of their deliverers, allowing them to make a safe and smart choice. The rating system also gives incentive to the deliverer to do well so that more people will choose them in the future. Using the app the deliverer will buy only the items whose barcode matches what the buyer ordered.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> We built a very simple prototype of the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We wanted to incorporate forms and databases however we were not able to do so in time so we focused on making the website look nice and convey the message and overall feel of our company. Instead of making everything perfect we created development pages that redirected the user to the home page when they stumbled upon a page that wasn't quite finished. After all even if we had coded everything today there are always ways to improve code, so we would have had to revise it anyway. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Using PHP was a challenge for us because, although we had some experience, we did not know how to insert data into a database, nor how to communicate back and forth between an HTML document and a PHP document, this was necessary because we needed to check our forms if all of the fields were filled out. Although we created all of the forms required to get started, they do not exactly lead anywhere because we do not have PHP, however we do have a structure for our database, thus moving on we know that we can easily combine what we have made so far. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> We are really proud of how the look of the website came out and how smooth everything runs. This is one of the prettiest websites we have ever made, so we are definitely proud of that. We are also proud of all the work we put into this. We really worked hard for these 48 hours and we worked great as a team. It was interesting to think about the business and profit side of our idea, because, although we would all like to develop apps for free, in reality that is not very possible. Every part of the developmental process costs money, so we are proud to make an app that meets the real life economic needs to make ends meet. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  We learned a lot about what the business structures of companies similar to our business model, which is something most do not really look into when they are at school. We're all taught to follow our dreams and take that leap of faith with our ideas, but sometimes there are similar ideas that already in place in the business world. That does not mean someone does not have an idea, it simply means that one has to work extra hard to make sure that their idea stands out and is different in a major way. In truth we are all innovators, building upon each other. These past two days we built upon our existing knowledge of code, our idea of a community-business, and the financial analysis from economic leaders in the world. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>What's next for Vicinia</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Although the hackathon is over, our development of Vicinia is not. The next step is to connect the forms to a web server that can store information and allow the user to actually use the data from the site. Besides technical development we would need more research into what it takes to have a partnership with big brand retailers and small local businesses so that we can further plan out our business process. \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a

Children will buy recycled plastic trading cards that will come to life in the Plantsy app. Children scan the cards, and view their new seed in a 3D world. They have to take care of the seedling, and then they get to watch it grow into a beautiful plant. The Plantsy team recognizes one of the most important global communities is often left voiceless. Despite a growing concern for the environment, humanity still has a lot of work to do. Plantsy aims to teach children to take care of the Earth while providing a fun game to share with friends. It brings a new dimension to apps by providing a more realistic, 3D experience.</p>\n<h2>How to Use</h2>\n<p>-To play, choose a plant type and view in 3D.</p><p>\n-Shake device to exit 3D Viewer mode. </p><p>\n-Click provide care button to learn more about the plant and to give it sunshine, water, and fertilizer. </p><p>\n-As you give the plant more sunshine, water, and fertilizer, the seed will grow into a seedling and then a plant. </p><p>\n-NOTE: Once the plant is fully grown the user can no longer give the plant sunshine, water, and fertilizer.</p><p></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Plantsy app shows 3D models of plants. The plant grows from a seed, to a seedling, to a plant as the user takes care of it.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Blender for the 3D graphics, and Xcode for the iOS app. We also used SceneKit, UIKit, And CoreMotion within Xcode to make certain features possible.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a few challenges. The first was that we had an issue where the textures on the plants would not ishop up in Xcode. To fix this, we imported the textures into the app so they could be referenced remotely. Another issue we ran into, was how to have the user exit the 3D viewer, without ruining the experience. To remedy this, we added a shake to leave feature.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of our whole project. Specifically, we find the 3D models, trading cards, and 3D viewer very special.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned a lot about iOS development, Blender, and entrepreneurship.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Plantsy</h2>\n<p>Next, we plan on connecting the cards to the app by requiring the user to take a picture of the card for it to show up on the app. We also plan on later releasing a beta for people to test Plantsy so we could eventually make a business with Plantsy and change a lot of children's lives.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>-Will run in simulator without bugs </p><p>\n-Will show errors if you run on a device, however these errors do not appear to affect the app. </p><p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wikitude</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">environment</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nature</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">education</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jlefelhocz/PlantsyApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jlefelhocz/PlantsyApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["iOS Developer", "", ""]], ["AirQual Mobile", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg-TzCcb0Bg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AirQual Mobile \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/980/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Pollution is an issue that is worsening as technological advances are being made in transportation and industry.

I downloaded quite a few of them from Google play into my tab. But I realized that mobile based learning is more isolating for the kids, as we hardly can participate with them in their learning process.</p>\n<p>His school has smart class. But when I went to school to check up, I realized that the contents were rich in animation and graphics as you would expect but low in process of learning. So I started thinking of creating some PC based apps for Rupansh.</p>\n<p>It is then I created a very simple app to make some simple animations. The basic idea was to render some gif and other images to make stories for him. As I started working towards it, I kept improving the engine, incorporating Mathematics, NLP, AI and several other critical components. My focus all throughout was to create an app that can be used to create other apps for teaching the kids. I called these miniature apps as activities. Each activity is a learning lesson. My initial idea was to go with Unity as one can expect. But I wanted to build something that can be used by other teacher to build their lesson too. So, I created an engine that can play a Rainbow activity. A Rainbow activity can be created without any coding. Entire logic is embedded into the file name. So any one with some basic knowledge of MS-paint can create an activity for his child.</p>\n<p>What it does\nRainbow is like an iTune for preschool teaching. It supports various activities like Odd Out, Pai matching, coloring, puzzles, puppetry, Mathematics, English language learning and so on. One can easily create a Rainbow activity by placing image and sound files systematically into specific folder. No coding is needed to create a Rainbow activity.</p>\n<p>The best thing about Rainbow is that it adjusts it's UI according to resolution. It is mainly developed for AIO platform where it's engine can handle upto 10 touch points. Every operation is alternatively supported with mouse also. Rainbow adjusts image resolution according to PC RAM settings and therefore runs well even in 32 bit 2GB RAM.</p>\n<p>Rupansh's school now has adopted Rainbow, replacing their hugely invested smart class app. The ability to run on any Windows PC makes it a one of it's kind.</p>\n<p>More than anything else, Rainbow bridges the gap between parents, teacher and the kids. With Rainbow, a teacher can actually play alongside the kids while teaching them, instead of actually \"teaching\". This makes the whole interaction between the teacher and the kids more intuitive. Each of Rainbow's activity is carefully designed to help the kid with self learning ability. Every character is sound and speech supported. So, the kids can learn themselves about various concepts as well as can play alongside their teachers and parents.</p>\n<p>How we built it\nRainbow at the core is simply a gif player. As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to add some simple animation for my kid. I had built the alphabet activity to render 'A' and 'Apple' together.</p>\n<p>My son was glued to my AIO for two days when I made the first version of Rainbow. But then he adandoned it. I realized that kids need new 'toys' and gets bored with same animations over and over. So I had to find a way to add new contents.</p>\n<p>Instead of building one app for whatever he needed to learn, I thought wouldn't it be cool if I can somehow create many activities without actually coding? It is this thought that gave rise to Rainbow engine.</p>\n<p>I created an entire game engine with basic gif player as the rendering engine. This game engine now could integrate new activities in Rainbow without coding. But nature of activities were too limited to make it a strong learning tool for Rupansh. So I bought various publisher's books upto lower KG. I categorized the workbook activities and created engine plugin for these activities. Then I separated the linguistic and numeric engines and finally puppetry and learning engine.</p>\n<p>Moumita, witht he experience of teaching Rupansh came in with ideas and logic to integrate conventional learning tools like charts into Rainbow She did the development. We included Manisha into our team for her expertise in Augmented reality. We are now exploring AR and VR plugins for Rainbow.She also helped in writing the code.</p>\n<p>Testing was done by Debashree Chanda.</p>\n<p>Touch Handling\nRaionbow supports both touch and mouse from out of the box. But there is a twist. Generally, when you handle mouse and touch differently, giving support to large number of activities for multi touch and multiple fingers becomes difficult. So we created a method for handling \"points\" relative to the rendering element. We have handled \"Click\" and move event separately. All we do is convert the touch and mouse specific coordinates to rendering coordinates and inject these values to our methods.</p>\n<p>The coolest part is that, unlike any other education game, Rainbow activity game mode is controlled by a virtual teacher, called teacher mode. For all the activities, the teacher mode can be turned off. Once you turn off the teacher mode, all the props and backgrounds are available for the kids for playing around. When the teacher mode is turned off ( by tapping the teacher mode icon at the bottom), kids can tap on animated character list and play with these characters, make movie, record video and so on.</p>\n<p>Multi-User: Our \"inject\" driven approach handles any number of touch points. For example in activities like ShadowArtist and Transport, you can bring multiple objects into the scene. Then many kids can together control/move these characters.</p>\n<p>Multi touch: When teacher mode is turned off, you can tap on the select button and then select any characters. The size of these characters can be controlled using multitouch outside the selection area.</p>\n<p>The movie player in the Video section is another multi touch fun which can be zoomed/panned and rotated in any angle with multitouch for a pleasant viewing.</p>\n<p>Challenges we ran into\nWe have met several challenges during the development of Rainbow. As Rainbow, was never meant to be what it is now, at the core it gets quaky in many logics. For almost all the new type of game, we need to alter the entire game engine, adding flags and trying to keep each activity unique. We hav't yet built a parser for Rainbow activities. So, after creating each activity, we are required to test the integrity of the activity by turning onto the debug mode.</p>\n<p>One of the other challenge was to train the teacher/user to use Rainbow. As, everyone is not well versed with kid's education, it gets difficult to perceive people about what Rainbow does. Even for the schools, pre-school teachers are far less computer trained. So created video series for Rainbow for making them comfortable with Rainbow. We are also running offline physical training programs in Rainbow to train the teachers to use it.</p>\n<p>Rainbow now has over 100 activities covering about 70% of UKG syllabus, 100% of LKG syllabus of KidZee international preschools.</p>\n<p>With mobile and tablets around, and with extremely high quality 3D graphics oriented apps around, it was very difficult initially to convince schools and the kids to try Rainbow. But once they did, the simplicity and the fun learning made it extremely popular.</p>\n<p>Accomplishments that we're proud of\nRainbow is in Pilot phase where we are running pilot in eight preschools. We have created a startup around Rainbow. When I built the first version of it, I had never imagined that it could be so popular that schools will be willing to pay for it. Schools along with their smart classes have also ordered AIO on our recommendations for many kids to learn together.</p>\n<p>We are extremely proud of the fact that kids are actually loving it and teacher are using it in real world in the class rooms.</p>\n<p>What we learned\nWe are keep learning with Rainbow. However, if we are to pick a single big learning lesson, it is the understanding of kids and their needs. This has particularly helped particularly me to educate my own son in better ways. We also learnt that it is not always the eye catching 3D graphics that makes an application popular, but the overall utility to for the user group it is meant for. We are re-living our childhood with Rainbow.</p>\n<p>What's next for Rainbow\nRainbow is now a startup, bootstrapped by us. We are looking for run rate to keep the dream and the project alive. Help us improve with your valuable suggestions and by spreading the word.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">csharp</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ua2vc55ztw2clfw/RainbowSetup.exe?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/ua2vc55ztw2clfw/RainbowSetup.exe?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Alertify", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Alertify \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/850/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Mockup of Contacts</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Alertify \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/851/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Mockup of Homescreen</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>With the rising popularity of online meetups, we became inspired by the dangers we might encounter if the meetup becomes potentially dangerous. This idea then led us to think about other dangerous or potentially dangerous situations users face but cannot readily report (ie. going home alone in the dark, etc). </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Alert!fy allows users to easily notify their contacts within a set radius through a customized SMS message. Even without wifi access, people may be alerted of surrounding dangers instantly. The phone accesses the geolocation of each contact to alert those within the alert radius, calculating the distance between. In addition, each user may easily add contacts and organize the contacts into groups for easy alert.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>First, the logo and the mockup user interface was created with Photoshop and Gimp. After there was a clear vision of the interface, a demo of Alert!fy was created.This application was built in Python using the Kivy framework, which comes with many preset layouts, transitions and app elements. Also, it is a compatible framework for various platforms, including desktop, android, and IOS. The alert feature relies on SMS messages, so twilio was used to get the messages to the designated phone numbers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>For several of us, this was our first hackathon so balancing the workload and planning out our go to strategy is a feat. All of us are also unfamiliar with mobile development and were learning how to use Kivy for the first time. As a result of this, many of our challenges involved using the Kivy framework as we were unfamiliar with its syntax and errors arose from this.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This was the first hackathon for several of us so to be able to finish a (somewhat) working prototype is an accomplishment we\u2019re proud of. Learning how to use a framework in such a small timespan is another accomplishment. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>To reiterate, we were most familiar with web development so we had to learn how to use Kivy for the first time. We also learned how to obtain the geo-location of the user without prompting.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Alertify</h2>\n<p>In the future, Alert!fy will have more additional features that makes the user location more visual, with a map that pinpoints where surrounding users are. Users may also preview the alert radius on a map for a clearer sense of distance. There will be a new mode of alert for emergencies that alerts the nearest police department.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kivy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gimp\">gimp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/powerpoint\">powerpoint</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/beautiful-soup\">beautiful-soup</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ml4963/Alertify\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ml4963/Alertify\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Settler", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Settler \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/966/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Splash screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Settler \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/967/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Creating a profile</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Settler \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/968/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Bulletin Board</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Settler \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/969/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Group chats and messaging</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Settler \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/970/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample profiles</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Settler \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/971/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Creating a profile</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Settler \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/393/972/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Community member list</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As residents of Atlanta, we were inspired by the diverse immigrant and refugee communities we saw in our city.

If you moved from Aleppo, Syria, but now reside in NYC, the app will add you to the closed community of others just like you. Members can message those on the same list, and create groups for different interests. There is also a bulletin board, in which anyone on the list can post listings.

We are targeting a young audience on a platform they are already using \u2014 iOS and Android smart phones. We also learned that Virtual Reality has been proven to create a higher sense of empathy with characters. </p>\n<p>The app features 2 different simulations \u2014 one from the perspective of the victim and one from the perspective of the aggressor. The victim is prompted to voice objections, distract, and remove herself from the interaction while reassuring her this situation is not her fault. The aggressor is met with questions of if consent was given and how to clarify before moving forward.  </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The working prototype was created in Unity3D with C# as the scripting language. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>First planned on developing it for the HTC Vive, but hardware setbacks allowed us to make it for the Google Cardboard, which is cheaper and more accessible.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We figured out new animations with 3D models in Unity that we hadn't used before.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Just how pervasive sexual violence really is and how we need to work harder to address it and identify solutions. </p>\n<h2>What's next for lotusVR</h2>\n<p>We definitely want to expand the app by adding more scenes, maybe assault from a stranger as well. We want to extend the simulations to make a more realistic environment since currently each is only about 45 seconds long. We also make it even more interactive. </p>\n<p><strong>Pitch Deck: <a href=\"https://goo.gl/uNFBE0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://goo.gl/uNFBE0</a></strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["No Tengo Miedo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJUme9AJr4Y?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"No Tengo Miedo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/394/019/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were get inspiration by one of our members Pamela that suffered sexual harassment on the first year of college .
