In this time and day nothing is more important than education. Absences usually lead to low grades which eventually lead to a student losing interest in class. So what steps should we take to avoid this? \nTo solve problems we often go to the roots of it. And that is exactly what our team did. We created TEACH to help absent students catch up with their work!\nTeach allows students to keep track of their work, connect with teachers and students live, submit their assignments, and participate in class discussions. \nIt is time to digitize education and TEACH is the first step towards reaching our goal:\nEducation For Everyone Everywhere</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://kevtlw.github.io/tch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://kevtlw.github.io/tch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>kevtlw.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PBOzePOKlWB6owPWQsNbaBcEKvflGvCHwmPpQMVwknY/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PBOzePOKlWB6owPWQsNbaBcEKvflGvCHwmPpQMVwknY/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["EducateMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YYyQL6kMdbc?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Language used by students at our school.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It teaches individuals about words that might offend others and checks an individuals's text to check for words that might be offensive.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first built a wire frame with all the components that we wanted to include. Then we described our code in simple English to understand what we needed the computer to do. Then we substituted that English idea with actual code to make the website come to life. The first important component of the website was developing the basic html/css format of the nine different webpages involved with the overall final project. Next we added functionality to the website by incorporating Quizlet API's to have educational games. Finally, we developed the Check My Text tool which analyzing text and notifies you when you have used a potentially offensive word. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenges were assigning individuals tasks to complete and figuring out how to change the background of the website.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our biggest accomplishment is the text analysis box. It required jQuery which would notify us what was in the text box, when the person clicks the button and enabled us to produce warnings.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to write out the code in English first, how to position a background image and how to manage time. </p>\n<h2>What's next for EducateMe: Preventing Bias through Educated Rhetoric</h2>\n<p>Our next step is to incorporate SlackBox into out platform to enable individuals to check their messages within the school and workplace at ease. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://educateme.neocities.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://educateme.neocities.org/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>educateme.neocities.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["DBNB which stands for Defeat Brand Name Bias.", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DBNB which stands for Defeat Brand Name Bias. \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/010/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>your clothing feed  app wireframe</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DBNB which stands for Defeat Brand Name Bias. \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/011/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>login app wireframe</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DBNB which stands for Defeat Brand Name Bias. \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/012/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>settings page  app wireframe</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DBNB which stands for Defeat Brand Name Bias. \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/013/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>cart page of the  app wireframe</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DBNB which stands for Defeat Brand Name Bias. \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/014/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>individual clothing entry  app wireframe</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration Our inspiration was, we were tired of watching kids get judged based off of what they wear.</h2>\n<h2>What it does  It's another option for people to consider before spending a ton of money on name brand clothing.

Insecurities can result in low self esteem, lack of confidence, and bullying. Nowadays, bullying has expanded to online apps and websites too. Social media has become an outlet and source for cyber bullying and can lead to very devastating consequences. We think today, bullying has prevailed more than ever because it has become easier to just post about it or comment something mean. With our app, we plan to reverse that by encouraging each other to rather compliment each other, accept each other, etc. But all that must start by first accepting YOURSELF and complimenting yourself. If you feel good about yourself, you're less likely to put others down. Simply changing your attitude in life can lighten up everyone's life. Our app aspires to fight the negativity by promoting positivity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>One feature we have is a reminder.. Throughout the day, from the time you wake up (It'll all be personalized accordingly to your own schedule) , you'll be reminded to just stay calm and release any bad mood in your system with random inspiring quotes. Quotes that can lift your spirits and boost your confidence so once you read them you'll be more positive. Positiveness, like a smile, is actually very contagious. It all starts with YOU.  (about 3-4 reminders a day)\nAnother feature we have are challenges. So in between the reminders you will get 1-2 challenges on your phone. These challenges will ask you to complete tasks that will promote positivity such as complimenting 2 people or help 3 people out with something. You'll have a log in journal, you can share it (Anonymously or publicly) or keep it private to help you vent out the negativity. You'll have a notepad to type in any quotes that really stuck to you and you take into consideration. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it through many html programming sites. We all took our task, completed it through various sites and then combined it in the end. For example, thimble, neosites, etc...</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many challenges, the coding got really difficult. But through many attempts, we finally got something to work for it to display.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're very proud of the progress we made because at first we barely were getting any work done. We just didn't know where to start and we were running out of time. But we're proud that once we assigned each person to a specific task and got the flow going we managed to get majority of our ideas out there.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned several things, we learned how hard and stressful coding can be, but what a relief it is when you finally get it to transfer correctly.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Positive Behavior Promotion</h2>\n<p>We intend to create an app with the sole purpose to reduce bad vibes and negativity around the world. We can all do this by staying happy and making the ones around us happy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://thimbleprojects.org/rogerj1/144983/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://thimbleprojects.org/rogerj1/144983/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>thimbleprojects.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["HelpNYC", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HelpNYC \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/453/968/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HelpNYC \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/453/969/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HelpNYC \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/453/970/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We saw that the LinkNYC by the city is very bland and lack with application. We also saw in our communities teens are feared and look of as unhelpful so we decided to tackle both problems with the same solution. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>HelpNYC is an initiative/startup/app to add more applications for the LinkNYC kiosks that will help the community. We created two apps to demo for the cause. The first Foster is an app that allows communities to vote on lease-able stores/building to decide which small business they want placed there. This helps small businesses and guarantees customers because the community vouched for it in a win win situation. The second app we are demoing is Sanctuary which is a app that allows homeless people find shelters nearby and RSVP for a bed for the night if they can't make the line in time. The request will be sent to the shelter and they can get a bed for the night making their lives easier and efficient rather than going to the chaos in the line. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For Foster this our first time really working with back-end work so it isn't 100% but it works. We used most Javascript ,npm packages, and frameworks. Socket.io so two people can interact on the site @ the same time. Node.js was used for most if not all server-side code. We also used React.js alongside with the npm packages. Most importantly we used love and positivity to bring it all together.</p>\n<p>For Sanctuary we used javascript, Jquery, sass, &amp; css to create a form page that is UX friendly</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A challenge we faced was coming up with the idea and ways we can incorporate breaking the bias of teens being unhelpful in communities. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the basics of back-end development and new concepts of advanced JavaScript. Also we learned more about the innovative aspects of New York City  attempting to be the new silicon valley.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HelpNYC</h2>\n<p>The next step for HelpNYC would be to pitch it to the City and congregate the support of the people and take it to the next level by making it an reality!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet
