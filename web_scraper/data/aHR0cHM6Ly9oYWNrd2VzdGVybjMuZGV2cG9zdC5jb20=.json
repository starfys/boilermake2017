We think that this is too much money to spend for simple communication and it has acted as a barrier for many blind people for a long time.  We plan to change this by offering a quick, affordable, precise solution to this problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This machine will allow you to type a string (word) on a keyboard.  The raspberry pi then identifies what was entered and then controls the solenoids and servo to pierce the paper. The solenoids do the \"printing\" while the servo moves the paper.</p>\n<p>A close-up video of the solenoids running: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jSG96Br3b4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jSG96Br3b4</a></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using a raspberry pi B+, we created a script in python that would recognize all keyboard characters (inputted as a string) and output the corresponding Braille code. The raspberry pi is connected to 4 circuits with transistors, diodes and solenoids/servo motor.  These circuits control the how the paper is punctured (printed) and moved.</p>\n<p>The hardware we used was: 4x 1n4004 diodes, 3 ROB-11015 solenoids, 4 TIP102 transistors, a Raspberry Pi B+, Solarbotic's GM4 servo motor, its wheel attachment, a cork board, and a bunch of Lego.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The project initially had many hardware/physical problems which caused errors while trying to print braille. The solenoids were required to be in a specific place in order for it to pierce paper. If the angle was incorrect, the pins would break off or the paper stuck to them. We also found that the paper would jam if there were no paper guards to hold the paper down. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of being able to integrate hardware and software into our project. Despite being unfamiliar with any of the technologies, we were able to learn quickly and create a fun project that will make a difference in the world. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>None of us had any knowledge of python, raspberry pi, or how solenoids functioned. Now that we have done this project, we are much more comfortable in working with these things.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Braille Printer</h2>\n<p>We were only able to get one servo motor which meant we could only move paper in one direction. We would like to use another servo in the future to be able to print across a whole page.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">blood</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sweat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tears</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pwnedpixel/BraillePrinter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pwnedpixel/BraillePrinter\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["SignFree", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SignFree \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/342/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>HomePage</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SignFree \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/345/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>MainPage</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We see technology progressing rapidly in cool fields like virtual reality, social media and artificial intelligence but often neglect those who really need tech to make a difference in their lives.</p>\n<p>SignFree aims to bridge the gap between the impaired and the general public by making it easier for everyone to communicate.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SignFree is a smart glove that is able to detect movements and gestures to translate sign language into speech or text.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>SignFree was built using a glove with embedded sensors to track finger patterns.

We believe that collaborating in groups yields great benefits in one\u2019s overall learning experience and is an imperative skill to have in today's society. Current methods were either inefficient or were too complicated to use, and we were seeking a more intuitive solution, which lead us to develop StudyLink. StudyLinkis an online platform that combines all a university\u2019s courses in to one large forum. This forum emphasizes the development of study groups through the users posts as well as pairing using the input of individual\u2019s personal preferences and goals. Moreover, it has access to many third party apps, such as calendar, and access to many of the course details such as the syllabus. StudyLink makes the process of communicating about courses simple and effective, which resolves our two main issues with today\u2019s alternatives.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<p>All features are planned:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>repository of course syllabuses and scheduling details</li>\n<li>auto class enrollment</li>\n<li>class forums/study group requests</li>\n<li>formation of virtual study groups to facilitate actual study group formation</li>\n<li>group messaging, shared files, calendars, links</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Build Process</h2>\n<p>After several failed attempts at building a front-end working model of our web-app, after resorting multiple times to Bootstrap and templates only to scrap our work, we decided to focus our efforts into the idea, the pitch, and a semi-interactive model that demonstrated a small portion of what could have been if we had the technical know-how necessary. This was done in Adobe XD (Experience Design) on the last night, and the resulting demo was embedded into our web page (HTML5/CSS) and hosted on Google Firebase, with our domain being provided by Namecheap.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned &amp; Challenges</h2>\n<p>Since this was our groups first hackathon, and our first time coding in several years, there was a lot of emphasis on gaining the technical knowledge needed in coding to develop this platform. Many of us attended the workshops throughout the weekend, most notable the design workshop, and spend most of our time learning languages such as css, html and swift, to name a few. We were able to identify a problem that directly affected, the difficulty of forming study groups and meeting people, us and decided to come up with a solution.</p>\n<p>Going in with very little combined knowledge of front and back end web development, our team was faced with several challenges. Building a functional, scalable platform that could support the functions that we wanted to have was simply not possible given the amount of time. However, we did spend a significant amount of time extending our knowledge bases: HTML5, CSS, Swift, and Git, to name a few. We believe this fits this year's HackWestern theme: learning.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we were placed in a completely foreign event for all of us and came out with more knowledge in not only coding, Photoshop and web design, but also in teamwork and perseverance to push through the long hours necessary to create the foundation for this platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xd</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://uwostudylink.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://uwostudylink.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>uwostudylink.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hackwestern3.firebaseapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hackwestern3.firebaseapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackwestern3.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the demo tech, and attempted a HTML/CSS web interface.", "", ""]], ["UpLync", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gHQMwq23YXs?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UpLync \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/835/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UpLync \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/857/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p><img alt=\"UpLync\" data-canonical-url=\"https://s18.postimg.org/5syr0jrg9/ss_2016_10_15_at_06_36_48.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--QXopUbQJ--/https://s18.postimg.org/5syr0jrg9/ss_2016_10_15_at_06_36_48.png\"/></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Two weeks ago you attended an event and have met some wonderful people to help get through the event, each one of you exchanged contact information and hope to keep in touch with each other.

The user places their medication on the pill mount. As the time nears for the user to take their medication, the app notifies the user that they should take their medication. The pill mount detects when they take their medication. If the user does not, the app notifies them. Should the user not take the pill within a specified period after this, it is counted as them having missed taking their medication. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>-- Hardware --\nThe pill mount was built out of three main components: the Raspberry Pi 3, an infrared LED, and an infrared phototransistor. The LED and phototransistor are used as a touch-less way of detecting when the user removes the pill bottle from the mount. If this was done close enough to when the user is supposed to take their pills, then the assumption is made that the user took their pills for that time slot. \n-- Software --\nOn the software side there was a combination of front end as well as back end developments. For the front end, an iOS mobile application was used to gain input from the user as well as to present calendar information. The input method utilizes speech-to-text technology to translate user voice input to a text input. From there, the user is able to edit the textfield if any mistakes were made. Then to input is passed to an AI for parsing and understanding of the statement. That data is later is sent to a back end server that keeps track of the user's pill intake via communication with the Raspberry Pi 3 and communicating using the calendar screen on the iOS application. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>one of the major challenges we encountered was trying to connect the raspberry pi, the phone and the server all together. Due to the security of the wifi, it was very difficult to ssh into either the raspberry pi or properly set up http requests between the devices. Our work around for this was to set up a LAN that let us connect all our devices and easily make requests between them</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Completing a project that involves hardware has been a goal of multiple team members for a while and this hackathon gave them the opportunity to do that. In reality though, the team is most proud that they were able to create an internet of things project where the hardware and software complement each other rather than feel arbitrarily attached.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The entire team learned a significant amount about network programming from troubleshooting issues with the Pi 3 and trying to interface the server with both system components. Otherwise, the learning was different for each member. The members who had experience with hardware were exposed to working with servers and databases. Simultaneously, the members with full-stack experience gained exposure to working with hardware. This resulted in all members becoming more well-rounded developers and gaining experience that will aid them in future hackathons and their careers. </p>\n<h2>What's next for PillHero</h2>\n<p>Post-hackathon, the team plans to continue development of PillHero into a more complete product. Numerous upgrades are planned like the ability to track non-daily medication routines and functionality with multiple drugs. On the iOS side in particular, implementation of push notifications and text message reminders are planned. As for the pill mount, the team plans to add an accurate to team plans to add an accurate analog scale to the device so it can notify the user when they are running out of pills. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/api-ai\">api.ai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple-speech-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlalchemy\">sqlalchemy</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rtemelkovski/HackWestern\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rtemelkovski/HackWestern\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["iOS", "", "", ""]], ["SpyMate 3D", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To take advantage of multiple input types from mobile devices to increase immersion and variety to desktop gaming.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Provides an engaging and unique experience to showcase the possibilities of linking desktop and mobile app development.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We began with creating a backend node.js server to delegate request between pairs of desktop and mobile clients.

We also did not have an Apple ID nor the financial resources to purchase one.\nThe idea was then to switch to Google Voice. But soon, it was realized that in order to accomplish customized requests from Google Voice to the app, Google needs to approve it, and they are not accepting applications right now anyway. Therefore, we decided to use API AI platform to integrate voice recognition into the app.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The development of android apps, and how APIs integrate with each other to provide a seamless user experience. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Budget Vocality</h2>\n<p>We believe this idea has tremendous potential, firstly by allowing almost anyone to get into the habit of budgeting, and allowing more and more people to become financially literate in a simpler, and much friendlier way. We believe this, coupled with the potential savings, make this an idea worth pursuing in the near future. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-voice</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nosql</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Fayadh56/androidfinance\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Fayadh56/androidfinance\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Was Lead Developer of the Application, worked on integrating the various API's to successfully implement Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning into the application.", ""]], ["MeSee", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MeSee \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/827/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MeSee \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/101/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample locations!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyone in society is likely going to buy a home at some point in their life.

This unfortunately leads to many students falling into debt, and having a difficult time keeping up with their finances. That's where wiSpend comes to the rescue! Our objective is to allow students to make healthy financial choices and be aware of their spending behaviours.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>wiSpend is an Android application that analyses financial transactions of students and creates a predictive model of spending patterns. Our application requires no effort from the user to input their own information, as all bank transaction data is synced in real-time to the application. Our advanced financial analytics allow us to create effective budget plans tailored to each user, and to provide financial advice to help students stay on budget.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>wiSpend is build using an Android application that makes REST requests to our hosted Flask server. This server periodically creates requests to the Plaid API to obtain financial information and processes the data. Plaid API allows us to access major financial institutions' users' banking data, including transactions, balances, assets &amp; liabilities, and much more. We focused on analysing the credit and debit transaction data, and applied statistical analytics techniques in order to identify trends from the transaction data. Based on the analysed results, the server will determine what financial advice in form of a notification to send to the user at any given point of time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Integration and creating our data processing algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This was the first time we as a group successfully brought all our individual work on the project and successfully integrated them together! This is a huge accomplishment for us as the integration part is usually the blocking factor from a successful hackathon project.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Interfacing the Android and Web server was a huge challenge but it allowed us as developers to find clever solutions by overcoming encountered roadblocks and thereby developing our own skills.</p>\n<h2>What's next for wiSpend</h2>\n<p>Our first next feature would be to build a sophist acted budgeting app to assist users in their budgeting needs. We also plan on creating a mobile UI that can provide even more insights to users in form of charts, graphs, and infographics, as well as further developing our web platform to create a seamless experience across devices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">plaid-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Gourdam/wispend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Gourdam/wispend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Arcadian Conquest", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Arcadian Conquest \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/100/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>After seeing the breakout success that was Pokemon Go, my partner and I were motivated to create our own game that was heavily tied to physical locations in the real-world.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our game is supported on every device that has a modern web browser, absolutely no installation required. You walk around the real world, fighting your way through procedurally generated dungeons that are tied to physical locations. If you find that a dungeon is too hard, you can pair up with some friends and tackle it together.</p>\n<p>Unlike Niantic, who monetized Pokemon Go using micro-transactions, we plan to monetize the game by allowing local businesses to to bid on enhancements to their location in the game-world. For example, a local coffee shop could offer an in-game bonus to players who purchase a coffee at their location.</p>\n<p>By offloading the cost of the game onto businesses instead of players we hope to create a less \"stressful\" game, meaning players will spend more time having fun and less time worrying about when they'll need to cough up more money to keep playing.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>The stack for our game is built entirely around the Node.js ecosystem: express, socket.io, gulp, webpack, and more. For easy horizontal scaling, we make use of Heroku to manage and run our servers. Computationally intensive one-off tasks (such as image resizing) are offloaded onto AWS Lambda to help keep server costs down.</p>\n<p>To improve the speed at which our website and game assets load all static files are routed through MaxCDN, a continent delivery network with over 19 datacenters around the world. For security, all requests to any of our servers are routed through CloudFlare, a service which helps to keep websites safe using traffic filtering and other techniques.</p>\n<p>Finally, our public facing website makes use of Mithril MVC, an incredibly fast and light one-page-app framework.

We noticed that hospitals work individually to combat the issue of long patient wait times, and the Canadian government has spent over 100 million dollars to fix it in the past year alone. Introducing, a service that works with all hospitals\u2014a collaborative approach to better the lives of all Canadian citizens.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TimeToCare is a web-based application designed to mitigate the long wait times experienced in hospital ER settings. Our service tackles the root of the problem by directing patient streams to hospitals better-suited to accommodate them. This results in a smoothed out demand at each health care centre, less frequent patient-demand spikes, and thus faster time to be treated.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the components of our app with a few different languages and tools.  They include HTML/CSS to build the framework of our website, Javascript for the general functionality of the website, and data from the Google Maps API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Challenges in our project mostly arose from the learning curve of what was required to build our application.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud to have developed a website, we believe, could have an impact in the health field.  We came to HackWestern with the hope of solving this problem and despite our relative inexperience with any of the APIs or new languages, we feel like we have accomplished something amazing.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Including the programs and tools we used to build TimeToCare, we also learned teamwork, the importance of clear communication and good design principles.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TimeToCare</h2>\n<p>Our next step for TimeToCare would be to create a scalable build.  Now that we have supported our theory of directing patients to hospitals based on wait times and distance, we would like to see it run using real-time data, in numerous locations.  We could see the required data being pulled from a government website or provided by the hospitals directly to the app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://timetocare.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://timetocare.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>timetocare.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I reviewed the Google Maps API documentation so our app could determine the travel time of users from their current location to the nearest hospitals.

Simply \"hug\" our Android friend, and he'll record your squeeze and put it into our database. From our mobile/desktop apps, you'll be able to look at your hug trends as well as other hug data. While it's innately simple, Do You Want To Hug Me is extremely flexible. Individuals can choose what hugging the plush means (e.g. hug each time I'm stressed, hug each time I'm very happy), and then look at a visual representation of their day in forms of hugs. Users can then figure out, for example, what times they're the most stressed, or when they're the most happy, or every time they see a Donald Trump post on Facebook. The world is their oyster!</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Well, that Android plush from Google was pretty cute looking, so much in fact that we decided to hug it repeatedly (it's very, very soft). Hugging makes you feel naturally better, but we started wondering what we could do with our hugs. A simple action like squeezing a toy can give a lot of information about a person: how hard they squeeze, how long they squeeze, and how frequently they squeeze. Unfortunately, due to time and resource constraints, we focused on only one: hug frequency. While the hug can mean something different for each person, it's still a pretty cool insight into your life. You can see when you're hugging more, and also have a lot of fun squeezing a little plush. It's a win win!</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>We failed <strong>a lot</strong>, but during that process we learned even more, so it was generally alright! Originally, we planned to measure pressure, frequency, and time, but we quickly realized that we had to focus our resources on a more narrow goal. Throughout our development cycle, we encountered numerous problems: whether it was with Bluetooth interfacing between the Arduino 101 and our Computers/Phones, to huge backend server mishaps, and a complete shift from a mobile-oriented product to a desktop-focused product (after a colossal mobile failure), it was a very rocky road. Ultimately, our final product wasn't close to what we imagined at the start, but that was fine! We're still super happy that we were able to make something so cool, and plus we know what kinds of mistakes that we probably shouldn't make again in the future. Probably.</p>\n<h2>Learning</h2>\n<p>One of Hack Western's themes this year was learning, and we tried our best to use this hackathon as an opportunity to do just that. Each of our team members took to learning a new topic area that they hadn't practiced before. Here are a few quotes from our team members:</p>\n<p>\"I worked mostly on the backend. I've used node before, but this was my first time actually peaking into the HTTP(S) protocol, which was awesome. It was also my first time taking security seriously, so I also learned a ton about encryption techniques. Next time I'm at a hackathon, I think I'd like to write my own SSL client to take a deeper poke at the world of web security\" - Jack Sarick</p>\n<p>\"I worked mostly on the front-end of DYWTHM, but also did a few backend tasks when I could. While I'm not a complete stranger to front-end frameworks, this was my first time dealing with asynchronous development: our mobile (and desktop) applications needed to sync their data with our webserver, updating each other every time new data was made. I learned a lot about the do's (and many, many dont's) of async development, and I'm super excited to take this new knowledge into the future! I <em>promise</em> to try more back-end things at my next hackathon: full-stack development looks super cool, and I'm hungry for more!\" - Matthew Wang</p>\n<p>\"I worked mostly on the hardware testing, connection and bluetooth communications. I test individual sensors and algorithms on bluetooth communications with smartphones. Finally, I make sure all components are working together.\" - Simon Guo</p>\n<p>All of us learned a lot at Hack Western, especially from our fellow hackers and mentors. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Our team absolutely loved Hack Western: we got to meet tons of new, super smart and cool people; we got to demo awesome new tech; and we got to learn from industry pros. We're also super proud that we were able to complete Do You Want To Hug Me: it's a project that we put a lot of time, effort, and love into, and we're excited to see what'll come next. And, we got to hug a lot of people.

As a consumer, the app locates the user using GPS location and <em>Google Places</em> is used to find walk-in clinics near you. The user can filter walk-in clinics by distance or city and then choose a convenient time for his/her appointment. All the clinics unfiltered by the user will receive a notification in their app of this request and the first clinic to accept the request will receive the consumer. Cancellations of appointments are available until 3 hours before the scheduled appointment. The consumer will pay a deposit fee of $5.00 that will be given back when they show up to the appointment on time.

It took a lot of hard work and problem solving in order to create this app, since we ran into many unexpected obstacles. Currently </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Most of our team have already had moderate exposure to Android Studio. What this meant was, we already knew how to make basic android apps. This project forced all three of us to go outside of our comfort zone and learn man new functions and syntax in Android studio to make this app. It was very rewarding learning these new things, since they will serve us in the future. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Find Me A Doctor</h2>\n<p>The next steps would be to improve the user interface of this android application. The app itself looks a little messy right now, and needs to be cleaner in order to be more appealing. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SaharshHariharan/Patient-Wait-Time\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SaharshHariharan/Patient-Wait-Time\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Reverse Outbreak", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Reverse Outbreak \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/945/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home page of Reverse Outbreak </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Reverse Outbreak \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/770/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>About Page + Search Bar - allows one to find a disease and check its location mentions around the world</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Reverse Outbreak \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/912/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Types of Epidemics </i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>      **In 9th grade, we were each given a cup of a clear liquid. We were told to walk around the class and exchange our cup of liquid with three other people in the class.**\n</code></pre>\n<p>_One person in our class had a chemical that would cause the mixed liquid to turn red once two liquids were combined. The red liquid indicated that that person was infected. Each exchange consisted of pouring all the liquid from one cup to another, mixing, and pouring half of it back. At the end of the exercise, we were surprised to find that 90% of the class had been infected in just 3 exchanges by one single person. This exercise outlined how easy it is for an epidemic to turn into an uncontrollable pandemic. In this situation, prevention is the only effective method for stopping an epidemic. So, our team decided to create a product focused on aiding epidemiologists prevent epidemic outbreaks. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The user enters a disease into our search filter and clicks on the disease he/she is looking for. The user then gets a map on where that the disease was mentioned the most in the past month with places where it was recently mentioned a lot on Twitter. This provides data on the spread of disease/</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>      The website uses a Twitter API to access Tiwtter's post database. We used Flask to connect front-end and back-end. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>      One of the biggest challenges we ran into was definitely our skill and experience level with coding and web design which were both well...sub-par. We only knew a basic amount of HTML and CSS. When we first started designing our website, it looked like one of those pages that appear when the actual page of a website can't load fast enough. It took us a fair amount of googling and mentorship to get our website to look professional. But that wasn't even the hard part. None of us were familiar with back-end design, nor did we know the software required to connect front-end and back-end. We only recently discovered what an API was and by recently I mean 2 days ago, as in the day before the Hackathon started. We didn't know about the Python Flask required to connect our front-end and back-end, the javascript required for managing search results, and the Restful Python with JSON required to bring specific parts of the Twitter API database to users. In fact, by the time I send this devpost out, we're probably still working on the back-end because we still haven't figured out how to make it work. (But we promise it will work out by the deadline). Another challenge was our group dynamic. We struggled at the beginning to agree on an idea. But, in the end, we fleshed out our ideas and came to an unconditional agreement. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>      When my group told me that they were serious about making something that was obviously way beyond our skill level, I told them to snap back to reality because we didn't know how to make the vast majority of the things we wanted to make. In fact, we didn't even know what was required to make what we wanted to make. I'm actually really glad they didn't listen to me because we ended up doing things that we would have never imagined we do. Looking back, it's actually pretty incredible that we were able to make a professional looking and functioning site, coming in with basic HTML and CSS abilities. I'm really proud of the courage my team had to dive into unknown waters and be willing to learn, even if they risk having no tangible things to show for it.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>     From Googling, soliciting help from mentors and our peers, we got to sharpen the knowledge we already had about web design while getting exposure to so many other languages with different syntaxes and functions. Before HW3 I had no idea what bootstrap, css\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What's next for Reverse Outbreak</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>      We will improve the algorithm of our website, develop an app, and incorporate more epidemics around the world.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ETedward/Hack-Western---Epidemic-Hack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ETedward/Hack-Western---Epidemic-Hack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Spruce Banking Project", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spruce Banking Project \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/164/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Spruce Banking: forward-thinking financially and environmentally</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Canada is ranked 6th from the bottom on the 2016 climate change performance index and has the 2nd worst carbon emissions level out of 61 countries. The UN Head of Environment says it will cost 5 to 7 trillion dollars to fix the issues. Our generation needs to be financially responsible for themselves so the government can focus on sustainable development. However, with one-third of our Canadians not making enough money to pay off their financial bills, we aimed to teach financial literacy and raise awareness about our environment through our user-friendly personal banking app.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Spruce Banking is an Android app that is meant to seamlessly incorporate personal banking into helping to improve the environment by facilitating sustainable development in Canada. Its users are currently able to sign in to the app\u2019s very own bank account and register transactions in their savings account. Whenever money is deposited, a tree is planted in real-life, and they are given a virtual tree to represent their success. This encourages financial literacy among individuals by encouraging the saving of money, as well as brings notice to environmental and sustainability issues around the world.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript, XML to write our code and implement it to build our android app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The hardest challenge was compiling all of the code we had each written individually. We had members working on functionality, design, and layout, but in the end, it had to be put together. Since none of us have ever built an app or done a project where languages had to interact, our challenge was incorporating the CSS, HTML, Java, JavaScript, and XML to create one whole product.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of the sole fact that we came up with such an unconventional idea between two sectors that have a lot of potential to assist in helping the world become greener. We\u2019re also proud that we were able to carry out the idea to make a real living, breathing app! We\u2019re all high school students, and half of us have only taken one computer science course, so putting everyone\u2019s skills together turned out to be very complimentary.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As a group of first-time hackers, we learned how to put all of our skills together to create one uniformed coding project. The experience of building an android app within 36 hours was a completely different challenge that we faced. We learned to manage our time wisely within those 36 hours, plan and coordinate accordingly, learn different coding languages at times to speed up the process, and implement our ideas into reality.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Spruce Banking Project</h2>\n<p>Before Spruce Banking Project is released on the Google Play Store, we wish to expand it by adding more relevant and useful features that our users are actually able to use. Some top priorities would be to fully integrate this app with banking systems in real-life such that Spruce would be able to track all transactions in their bank account and base the tree-planting off of that. Additionally, we could also add features such as a more in-depth goals section and a financial analysis system. We believe that these features will allow us to attract a broader and greater audience so that we can influence the world both financially and environmentally.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Tectonic", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Nothing is more strangely calming than low poly, other than rain maybe. This game is both! I've always wanted to make a game \u2014 try as I might, my bread-and-butter web, graphic and print design by nature really do lack in the interactivity department.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The \"cloud layer\" is a procedurally-generated ball pit in body-centered cubic formation contained in a hollow box. I was going to randomly percolate balls from this layer to fall into the terrain, weighted on their downwards pressure, but Unity doesn't provide accessible, component-by-component static forces for analysis, so while that is in the works, this POC shows a \"heavens opening\" model. The terrain at the time of writing is waiting for implementation of the objectives.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Terrain is a default mesh/MeshCollider populated by a Delaunay triangulation of a point cloud with Perlin noise creating the elevation map. The ball pit is generated by a base square grid of RigidBody spheres to which I iteratively shifted coordinates and found stable positions on top of the previous layer (at least 3 points of contact).</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>So it turns out, meshes in Unity have <em>orientation</em> of clockwise vs. counterclockwise that dictates the hemisphere they can be viewed from. Rendering the meshes was a nightmare because the Delaunay triangulation returns a list of line segments in an undefined order, which I had to cluster into proper triangles without foresight about the orientation. At first, the terrain was rendered like swiss cheese, which I thought was a problem with the triangulation. </p>\n<p>After realizing that orientation was causing problems and patching it, the map was more consistent but half of the tiles had opposite orientations still! Unity truly has no forgiveness: in trying to fix another two problems, I was causing this new one.</p>\n<p>Gravity and orientation in Unity are Y-up, but their <code>Vector3</code>\u2192<code>Vector2</code> cast truncates the Z axis. I was intending on preserving Y-axis gravity and rotating the terrain on the XY plane into the XZ plane. However, my quaternion rotation for some reason changed the orientation as far as Unity is concerned, so +Z-facing components were visible in one Z hemisphere and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Instead, I had to rotate the camera and gravity to follow the Z axis.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I made a mesh myself instead of using the standard Terrain library because I thought I could force triangulated low-poly, but while the geometry is coarse, the shading is smoothed without any way to disable it, even with Toon shading.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I thought I picked up a good chunk of Unity for my first time! Getting the mesh to render was cool too.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>3D game programming is an endeavour.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tectonic</h2>\n<p>The way the game is supposed to operate is the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are pits and objectives. Objectives are tiny tiles perched on intense slopes that require balls stay on the surface for a while before rewarding the player with currency. Pits just swallow balls without replacement.</li>\n<li>The currency dictates how much the user can change the terrain. Every world unit of modification comes at a certain price. Pits and objectives can't be moved.</li>\n<li>The weighted percolation was meant to serve as the strategizing point for the user, who has to prioritize sources of balls with the cost and risk of the route they build to the objectives. Since objectives take time, balls might queue in a route and overflow into a pit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this is yet to be completed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/acrylic-origami/tectonic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/acrylic-origami/tectonic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Everything outside of moral support."]], ["CharityBazaar", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CharityBazaar \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/231/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Charity Bazaar helps charities create economic and social value by working on a global scale with businesses to connect, collaborate and succeed. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It provides a platform for businesses to donate their services to charities and also find their next potential clients.

This data will provide a further insight into the potential of success or failure a company may have. The data will be plotted along with each company's stock trends for an easier analysis.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to provide the users with a new tool for analyzing stock trends. Since social media can have a serious impact on business, it is logical to think that the positive or negative articles being written about certain companies can have an impact on their shares. </p>\n<p>StockPile also provides the ability to simulate the buying and selling of stocks, and to manage a personal portfolio of one's stock data. The application encourages the use of storing a user's stock portfolio (including real dollar amounts), and allowing the user to observe sentiment analysis trends to provide assistance in deciding when to buy or sell stocks. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>The implementation of StockPile was divided across the team. One member focused on processing the data through the Node.js server, while the other member focused on implementing front-end logic in JavaScript and EJS templating. </p>\n<p>On the back-end, Express routes were set up to provide access to many different views and handle user sessions. Then, the focus shifted to gather data by interacting with the external APIs. New York Times API was used to gather news articles on each company, then these were fed into the Dandelion API for Sentiment Analysis. Once the data was retrieved, it was parsed and put into clean formats for use on the front-end. The server required use of many different \"node modules\" or npms, in order to drive the development and make data processing easier to manage.</p>\n<p>On the front-end, the implementation of Data Tables created an organized way to store and view stock information. It also provided simple access to the sentiment analysis data specific for each stock. Then, the buying and selling of stocks were implemented along with user profiles to keep track of portfolios for each user. The Chart.js library was used to visualize our results, providing a plot of sentiment data, along with the Yahoo! Finance stock trend information.</p>\n<p>In terms of technology, Node.js was used as the server, with primarily JavaScript/JQuery as the client. EJS (Embedded JavaScript) was used as a templating engine for different views, and mixed nicely with the CSS of Semantic UI. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Publicly accessible free APIs caused several issues during the development of this project. Originally, we had chosen to obtain our sentiment analysis information from IBM Watson's AlchemyNews API. This API was perfect for what we wanted to accomplish because it queried it's own storage of news articles, without us having to retrieve the articles ourselves. However, the problem was that the API limit was exceeded after only a few requests, making it a frustrating process to work around. In the end, we ended up using two separate APIs to complete the task, which required a little extra effort. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>Going into this project, we were not certain that the results we obtained were going to in-fact show accurate results. It was indeed a gamble to assume that we would see stock prices contain a correlation to news articles. We are proud to say that after implementing our application, we were correct to assume that the stock prices would indeed fluctuate with the sentiment analysis retrieved from news articles. This was a huge bonus for us to know that our implementation is indeed useful and correct. </p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>Financial technology has not been a focus of ours, therefore we feel we learned a lot about the financial technology sector. We also learned a lot about different types of sentiment analysis, as we had to go through many external APIs before we found one that suited our needs, after our original API fell through. This was a unique experience, as these APIs certainly provide an advanced way to write code. </p>\n<h2>What's next for StockPile</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implement different types of cognitive analysis to be plotted and observe their trends against stock data</li>\n<li>Implement real-time stock trading to centralize the task of buying and selling with the tools that make the process more efficient </li>\n<li>Implement machine learning to recognize further trends against stock information</li>\n<li>Implement cognitive assistance to help suggest stocks to buy/sell based on stock information and sentimental analysis</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ejs\">ejs</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">semantic-ui</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/new-york-times\">new-york-times</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dandelion</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yahoo-finance</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">data-tables</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chart-js\">chart.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://stockpile-hw.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://stockpile-hw.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>stockpile-hw.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tgfischer/StockPile\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tgfischer/StockPile\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Impressionable", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of our members, Shayla, has experience in hosting formal recruiting events, and has had difficulty in remembering all of the qualified candidates she had networked with.

We first designed the inference using XML and then individually programmed the interface using JAVA. Finally, we merged all of our activities and Java files together and troubleshooted all of the remaining problems. </p>\n<p>Our largest hurdle during our 36 hours was programming in Android Studio since it was a new experience for us. Merging branches to put everything together since we were all working on different areas, was one of the most difficult parts since Android Studio is not properly optimized for github collaboration. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rohanperi/FlowNotes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rohanperi/FlowNotes\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Talent Exchange", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Talent Exchange \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/006/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Talent Exchange \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/017/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make a collaborative community where talents can be exchanged.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Members can earn points to improve renown, or even exchange for money.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a variety of plugins including underscore.js</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team lacked backend experience, so we simulated database data using javascript objects.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to make the data dynamic so we can add them any time, and display them.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Even though the implementation failed, we set foot in Node.js and socket.io.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Talent Exchange</h2>\n<p>Implement a backend data system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bowenzhai/talent-exchange\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bowenzhai/talent-exchange\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Resudrop", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Resudrop \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/187/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Recruitment made easy.</h2>\n<p>Fall is an incredibly busy time for recruiters, as students begin looking for summer internship and full-time placements alike.

And to add insult to injury, I'm not even particularly good at it.</p>\n<p>So, like any good aspiring engineer, I decided to take the lazy approach, and built a JavaScript-based AI to play it for me. Tetr.js uses a machine learning algorithm to continuously refine the weightings of the parameters which define a good move.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Animated tetris gif\" data-canonical-url=\"https://willclark.io/images/tetris.gif\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--Q20oVyhO--/https://willclark.io/images/tetris.gif\"/></p>\n<h2>So, Machine Learning?</h2>\n<p>I knew nothing about machine learning, so I based the design off what I knew about real-world evolution of organisms. The genetic algorithm contains 3 key features:</p>\n<p><strong>Inheritance</strong></p>\n<p>Each candidate algorithm inherits each of its properties from one of its two parents, with a slightly higher probability of inheriting from the higher-scoring parent.</p>\n<p><strong>Scarcity</strong></p>\n<p>After each generation, the lower performing half (5 / 10) of the candidates is killed off. The remaining 5 candidates \"reproduce\" in every possible combination, for a total of 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 new candidates for the succeeding generation.</p>\n<p><strong>Random Mutation</strong></p>\n<p>When a trait is inherited, it has a small chance of the trait being randomly adjusted higher or lower by a small amount. Also, there's a very small chance of the trait being randomly adjusted by a large amount. The idea it that positive mutations tend to persist and survive, and the negative ones die off.</p>\n<h2>How It's Built</h2>\n<p>It's all Javascript and jQuery, and runs on the client side, in the browser. That means you get a blank canvas every time you refresh the page, and get to watch your optimal Tetris algorithm being evolved from scratch.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The biggest problem is that the better the algorithm gets, the longer it takes to test, and so more time passes between generations. Also, there's no good way to tell if a candidate is truly immortal, except by waiting around to see what happens. Still, seeing as a standard game of Tetris involves clearing 40 rows, and the bot's record is going on 80,000 rows, it's good enough to demonstrate the concept.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Machine learning, or at least, my own best stab at it. But other than the challenges of implementing such a complex program using client-side JavaScript, probably the most valuable thing I learned was how, if stuck on how to implement something, it's usually best to model it off of some kind of physical analogue; in this case, biological evolution.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://actar.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://actar.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>actar.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Stitch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stitch \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/823/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stitch \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/824/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>FYI: YOU NEED TO BE ADDED AS A TESTER FOR THE LINK TO WORK</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We missed playing with our Tamagotchis and Neopets, so we decided to bring it to the 21st century by integrating it with Facebook Messenger.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a Facebook page that you can message and interact with, like a pet.

Our hardware IoT solution reduces stress and the hectic nature of getting prepared in the morning, while also maximizing efficiency and user satisfaction.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project centers around time management before early morning events, both in regard to getting enough sleep the night before and operating in a timely fashion in the morning. Users are able to gain control over time management though a smart alarm that works alongside their google calendar events to balance their sleep schedule. The alarm takes location and start time of events, as well as the user's morning prep time to compute when the user should be getting sleep. The user is informed of when they should end their day in order to obtain a full 8 hours of sleep and receives an alarm in the morning to wake them.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Hardware</strong>- Using a Particle Spark Core as our main driver of interactions, as it is an IoT micro-controller. It recieves the push notifications from the nodeJS server indicating alarm and timing information. A button, piezzo buzzer are directly connected to digital pins on the Spark Core, and 4 digital pins are used to transfer timing information in Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) to the Arduino with a Groove Shield, at which point an LCD connected to the Arduino displays the time remaining.</p>\n<p><strong>Software</strong>-Using our nodeJS server we make calls to the google-calendar api to determine a users first event the following day. We then make a call to the google-distance api to find the time needed to drive to that event. Using the calculated time remaining until the event, drive time, and past data about the users morning routine we calculate when the user should go to bed/wake up and send that data to the Particle Spark Core.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating Particle functions in order to control the Spark Core remotely proved to be difficult in the end.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Originally we built the back end of our project using JavaScript and a Python server but we ported our software over to NodeJs which simplified authentication in connecting to the google-calendar and allowed us to make use of the google-distance api.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Sometimes the greatest difficulty in multifaceted projects is not the individual components but rather allowing for these components to work together effectively.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SmartMorning</h2>\n<p>Continuing to build integrated hardware IoT solutions to further achieve the project's overall goals.

While the system does show the compromised countries, it does not show which flag was actually captured. This led to a few issues where people ended up wasting time because they were both finding the same flag, as they did not know each other's progress.</p>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<p>CTFort aims to act as a centralized progress tracker towards flag captures. All you need to do to get started is log in/register and then create a team. Once a team has been created, you can invite your friends using the provided invitation code.

We believed we'd be mentally prepared and submitting a project wouldn't be so tough. We immediately regret our low expectations of what a hackNY had in store for the both of us and we were completely stumped with an idea.</p>\n<p>We however did stumble upon this idea in the midst of brainstorming, however we didn't know how to develop it and we only had less than 5 hours before demos were going to start so we gave up (We both still thoroughly enjoyed the hackathon though!!)</p>\n<p>Here I am, a couple months later with some more confidence and experience under my belt however my friend who came along to hackNY forgot to apply to this hackathon so I made it my sole mission to see through the hack him and I weren't able to pull of back in New York.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>As of now, it locates local ATMs within your vicinity and I know what you're thinking... Aren't there already apps like this provided by my local bank? My answer to that is a big fat NO because what ATMe sets itself apart from other ATM locaters is that it won't just track one bank's ATMs (What if the local TD ATM is 2 hours away??), it'll track any bank's making it a versatile tool for anyone to use. The app will indicate the service charge if you're using a bank that isn't yours and I was pondering on expanding this to 3rd party ATMs but I just don't know how haha.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I'm completely new to Swift and playing around with Google Maps' SDK so not only did I have an fresh idea to build, I also had to learn a language that was brand new to me, but that was one of the main reasons why I wanted to build this app because I've always wanted to give it a try!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The tutorials I found online that were teaching me! Since the language is most commonly used on XCode, a lot of functions, methods, etc get finished quick so when I'm trying to learn a new concept, I had a super hard keeping up because of the pace the tutors on YouTube were going at.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The fact that I was able to pull this off completely by myself! I didn't have any pressure with what I was trying to develop this weekend and I felt that really benefitted with the growth of this project and my skill set with Swift.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>That I love building apps as much as I love building websites haha I'm definitely going to try to get my hands dirty with app development again.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ATMe</h2>\n<p>I want to try scaling this app on a larger scale by working with more dynamic data. I've discussed the idea with my friend who came with me to hackNY and we both honestly believe it has potential. I don't know if I struck gold with this idea but I'm super excited to release this app online everywhere (For free duh)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/1c9fg57/screen/15411557\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://marvelapp.com/1c9fg57/screen/15411557</a></p>\n<p>^This is mock up I made was what I was aiming for this weekend</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Big Mouth Scraper", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Big Mouth Scraper \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/425/996/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Best coffee in toronto anyone?</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Too many restaurants, so little time.

By adjusting the rating against the sentiment analysis score we're able to obtain an establishment's \"true\" rating, which we can then display on a graph.\nWithin the UI, the user is able to change the search query to target general or specific businesses at a certain location.\nIn addition, they are able to change the number of businesses scraped, and the number of reviews per business displayed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The entire application: the scraper, the API request, and the UI was written in R.\nR swag.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We didn't really know how to use R at the beginning of the hackathon, so this was a huge challenge for us.

You would want to prize those age old vacation photos without being bugged by your lecture snaps every 5 photos. But you can\u2019t seem to get out of the cluttered Camera Roll. If the idea of so many photos and with that, so much sorting, seems daunting. Our app is of use to you. It sorts through all of that and suggest options to make albums, almost without even lifting a finger.</p>\n<p>More than just events and places, Sortify can sort according to moods and emotions. So if you were happy or smiling in a photo. Sortify will automatically collect all such photos for you so you can relive your best memories anytime, with little more than a mere tap of a button.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sortify, is a web based app that scans through your photo and sorts them automatically into potential albums you\u2019d like based on the content of those photos. For instance if you upload a mix of photos you took while having fun with a friend, some random selfies, nature photography and even in class lecture photos. Our app will automatically sort it into potential albums like lakes, cityscapes, lecture photos. It can even sort according to mood or how you were feeling based on those photos. For instance, it can collect all your photos in which you are happy so you can look back at those times easily. Letting your enjoy your memories without going through the long manual sorting process.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our approach to this was utilizing an API, Clarifai, which scans the images for keywords and sends back a JSON containing information regarding possible keywords relating to the image and probability estimates of certainty. We then extract useful information from the JSON output and format it. We pass the potential keywords in each photo through a filter that only keeps the highest probability options. We compile all the keywords from all the photos and tally frequencies. We then allocate scores to most likely options that result from our algorithm and sort photos into these albums that we allow the user to download as he chooses.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, all this is implemented at the front end through CSS to provide a comfortable, easy and friendly experience for the user. We have a minimalist and easy to use login page that asks user to create an account, this links to a second page that allows sign up and inputting a username and password. This creates a level of security for the photos. We have a login portal so privacy is not compromised as each individual\u2019s photos remain private. We then navigate to a page for uploading the photos. This too is an easy process, with the press of a button, literally. Hence, making it as user friendly as possible. Finally, on a final page we display choices for possible album names and allow the user to view sorted albums.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The path to this app had a number of difficulties. First off, we tried to code in Java Script and Node.js. However, that path, through promising had it\u2019s challenges. Primarily, the formatting of the JSON data in javascript was difficult to decipher and extracting the required output was highly inconvenient. Also working with advanced level Node.js proved troublesome, as we had not used it before. We then moved to Python and PHP at the back end. Extracting useful information was far more convenient in Python using dictionaries and arrays. We first implemented the rest of the keyword ranking algorithm in Python, then shifted some of the burden onto PHP for the web app. One key challenge was implementation of the process on a single page. Additionally, working with PHP was also a hurdle at times as web implementation of the app was challenging as only so many photos could be uploaded on the server and processing time sometimes was slow.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The app works for starters! Also we all gained a lot of new knowledge and learnt lots.</p>\n<p>We went through a lot of technologies and found which options worked best for us.</p>\n<p>Exclamations aside, we're excited for how this could help ease something everyone goes through with. More than just a facility, it can be a means to relive memories so easily and that's what really matters. We can make people happy and rejoice. Promoting positivity, one small step at a time and making the world a better place. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A couple of things:</p>\n<p>The importance of understanding the data that you're using.\nVersion Control is important.\nHaving a team with a diverse skill set can really be an asset.\nSimpler the idea, the better. (clearly)\nPHP is not the best option for web development. It's easier but clunkier.\nBootstrap is really pretty. \nFront end and back end are both very important.\nPage source is important for web development.\nUnderstanding the data you get is a key part of coding. So is finding how to access it.\nWhat process is simple in one language is difficult in another language's implementation.\nSleep is immaterial.\nSheer excitement for a project works better than caffeine.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sortify</h2>\n<p>We are considering a number of immediate features for expansion. Features like downloading albums, social media Integration and smarter backend processes are expected. We envision a smarter version of Sortify that makes it more individual by learning each user's preferences using Machine Learning. We are also considering expanding from a web app into mobile app as well so more users can use Sortify easily.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ngroc</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lenmorld/hackwestern3b.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lenmorld/hackwestern3b.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on backend.

After teaching ourselves about this subject, we\u2019ve found that there are very few simple resources that guide average Canadians through the different facets of finance. There are many amazing books and websites that focus on personal finance, but many people just don\u2019t know where to start. We have tried giving these resources to family and friends; however, the majority of them have found these to be too intimidating. As a team, we wanted to build an entry point for Canadians to learn the fundamental basics of personal finance. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our team developed a simplistic website that guides Canadians through five main pillars of personal finance: budgeting, debt, money savings accounts, investing, and other life goals (cars, housing and insurance). The website uses concise statements and friendly animations to convey these complex concepts. Ultimately, the user will be equipped with a basic understanding of financial literacy before embarking on a more detailed evaluation of their needs.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML, CSS and jQuery to make the website and external CSS libraries such as Animate.js and Textillate.js for animations. With a combination of novice and expert programmers, our team utilized Git as our version control system and used a combination of individual and pair (extreme) programming.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We encountered several challenges while developing our website. The first and most difficult challenge was generating the content. Due to the intimidating nature of the subject matter, we spent a significant amount of time deciding on what to include, what to omit, how to explain concepts, and how to order them. </p>\n<p>From a technical standpoint, one of the first challenges we overcame was contrasting programming backgrounds of our team. Half of the team were novice programmers and half were experienced, so a lot of time was spent mentoring. However, this enabled the novices to successfully contribute to the project. Another big challenge we faced was incorporating animations in a reusable way (rather than hard-coding every animation for each section). These animations also took a lot of time to plan and implement. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team successfully created the beginning of a simplistic, well-designed website. We made an animation framework, wrote all of the website content, and created mockups for much of the content. Another accomplishment was that two non-experienced team members learned HTML and CSS and contributed to the project. All in all, we finished what we set out to do in this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that well-designed, animated websites are difficult to create in 36 hours. Also, it is crucial to present information in an easily digestible format due to the subject matter. In terms of developing, we learned that pair (extreme) programming is an efficient and quick way to get things done and teach new programmers. </p>\n<h2>What's next for FinLit - A Canadian Financial Literacy Website</h2>\n<p>We would like to finish migrating data to the website. We\u2019d like to buy a domain name, host the website, and have it tested by friends and family. Lastly, we\u2019d like to explore the possibility of using better front-end frameworks such as Sass or Angular.js.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RyanHolmes/HackWestern3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/RyanHolmes/HackWestern3\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on developing the HTML and CSS code for two of our pages.

Our data is being stored in a mongo database.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of us had to learn about Flask and two of us had to learn how to use Ember.js. It was very challenging to take on such a big framework in this short time span. Integrating with APIs is always a challenge, and working with Google Places has been no exception. The scale of the Google Maps API suite is very large and it is sometimes hard to find the best way to solve certain tasks. </p>\n<p>Our team has never worked together before and had to figure it out. We all feel that we have grown a lot from this project and we are thrilled to have had the experience to work together at Hack Western. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our application is way bigger than we originally expected! We were not confident at the start that we would have enough time to pursue the Google Places integration. We tackled our MVP so quickly and efficiently that we had time to work on the look and feel of our hack along with the extra integration.</p>\n<p>We are very proud of how effectively we worked as a team. After we decided on our idea, we kept focused and complimented each other's skills amazingly. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>All of us spent a significant amount of time outside of our comfort zones. Our teammate, Cheryl, had very limited web experience going into this project. She stepped up and learned a lot this weekend about Ember.js. Matt had experience with front-end development but decided to spend a lot of time working on the server because he wants to move his career in that direction. None of us knew how to use Google Places and Charlie stepped up to the challenge after helping the other teammates get rolling!</p>\n<h2>What's next for getout.site</h2>\n<p>getout.site doesn't need to be limited to travel. In general, this is a great platform for discussing and voting on ideas. Integrations with other APIs and tools can allow for data visualizations, wikipedia links, etc. to be shown instead of Google Places information.</p>\n<p>In the short term, we acknowledge the need to improve usability and apply better design practices to our application. User testing and market research will help us build an application that many people will use. </p>\n<h2>Temporary notes</h2>\n<p>The domain may not have propagated yet.

To use GitFit, a user can choose from a number of different metrics to use as inputs.

We needed an alternate universe where we could run to and push all our problems to the side. But wait... what if this is possible!? Can it really be true!? If we could manipulate a virtual reality to take us to our happy place, it would work wonders for our mental health!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>a-MAZE-ing VR takes you to a world where you're haunted by your nightmares. Dreams do not exist, this is the reality of our life. Evil lurks at every corner... but there is a way out. Get to the end, escape the terrors, and survive. A heart racing, frightening place, where getting out is the least of your worries. a-MAZE-ing VR lets you face your fears at every corner. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using the incredible game engine of Unity, we were able to create a virtual world to place the player. Connecting the Samsung Gear VR, players can experience a whole new world. Scripts were written in C#, some assets were taken from Unity Asset Store because our expertise in coding does not correlate to our skills in creating realistic, horror filled monsters. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We wanted to use Oculus but according to our extensive Google research and testing, apparently it could not run on any of our wonderful pieces of mobile technology (our laptops). Thankfully, we were able to get a Samsung Gear VR to work on our idea. Most of our problems really occurred with asset sharing through git/github. Since many of us were working on different components of our game we created our own little test scenes which caused us to have problems when trying to merge our now working local components to the master branch. Not fun trying to figure out errors from 3D models when you're not even really sure how these 3D models are made. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were really excited when we got the game up and running on the Samsung Gear VR. Having essentially no knowledge of working with a virtual reality headset, it was extremely fun to be put right in the middle of our project. Being able to play around with a world we created and just honestly having fun were some of our proudest accomplishments. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Virtual Reality. How VR works, how it can be set up, and it's capabilities. VR has a fascinating future and I can't wait to see what that future holds. We built upon our previous Unity/Game development knowledge which is a major plus. Being able to use, and evolve our previous knowledge is an amazing thing to do. </p>\n<h2>What's next for a-MAZE-ing VR</h2>\n<p>Making a-MAZE-ing VR a more immersive world is it's most immediate future. Developing the environment and surroundings, so it feels almost real to the player is a real goal of ours.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/samsung-gear\">samsung-gear</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/samsung-gear-vr\">samsung-gear-vr</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hnrytrn/hack-western-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hnrytrn/hack-western-3\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on first person player implementation, asset implementation, and visual design!

The human brain is a wellspring of untapped knowledge, and a labyrinth whose depths we dare yet to plumb. Our feeble grasps at its depths have yielded few fruits as yet, but the fruits we have harvested are sweet in truth. </p>\n<h2>Well pardner, thats mighty poetic n all, but a man wonders whatchall gone made?</h2>\n<p>True as cows make milk, ain't nothin' been said 'bout that yet.

All we gone done is jerry rig a way to eat the mazes shallower plums at yall's convenience. We gone made an android application which measures y'all think box all the way up. Ain't nothin' on this green earth better than the sound of a dandy gizmo like that. It takes y'all braineywaves and herds all o em into nice categories, and spits out how many of y'all metaphorical cows y'all got.

Brainwave Bushido operates with the idea that one in control of their emotions can manage to manipulate their brainwaves and get a higher score. The samurai were masters of self-discipline, and that same trait is required for this game.</p>\n<h2>The tempestuous trials of technological tossing-together</h2>\n<p>The construction of a code collaboration of cranial consideration commenced with the contemplation of a contemporary course. Android architecture (android studio) allowed us to activate application adaptation, alongside actual artifice additions. Mightily, mayhap, the Muse mind minder muttered murmurings of misbehaving members in meticulous methods. Settings slapped us stopwise, and setups slowed us stiller, so sentinels we stood, in shaded seconds several. Wondrous and well, we wandered windless when worked our workings of watchful waiting. Gratefully gathering our group of ghoulish grimaces, we grew a grand gatherer of gleaned gestalts. </p>\n<h2>The <em>wonderful</em> challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>While creating our <em>masterpiece</em> there were many challenges that we ran into along the way. First of all, installing the software to enable the use of Muse on Android studios was an... experience. The files took far longer to install than anticipated. To add to the experience,on one of our laptops Android Studio had to be completely reinstalled to be able to accommodate the Muse software. After many hours spent preparing all of the required attachments to support Muse on Android Studio, the process of emulating the applications was a whole new nightmare that truly tested our patience. We also survived countless challenges while correcting errors found in the code, it was often unclear what the cause of the error was, which made finding the solution a laborious time. Once we finally managed to successfully configure Android Studio and run Muse, we ran into new challenges while attempting to use the data we collected and had to use different approaches to complete seemingly simple tasks. However, after many sleepless hours we finally resolved a method to create the app of our minds. </p>\n<h2>Hard won triumph</h2>\n<p>Sometimes a man's greatest talent is patience. Now, we've been around for a while. Seen men and women with no respect for a leisurely pace. Just can't sit still. Seen others too. People forced into great times of waiting. You grow restless when you've got a time limit, but can't put a foot on the gas pedal. Once, we were those people. We waited. Spent countless hours waiting for things we just couldn't speed up. Makes a person want to give up. Easy to quit when you're going nowhere fast. Us though? Well now. We took our time. The hours we spent in the dark with no sign of rest on the horizon... they weren't the greatest. Frustrating even. Even so, we forged on ahead. Took time. Lots of it. Eventually though, it paid off. We were free, and I'd never been prouder.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Well immersing ourselves in the wonders of Android Studio, we improved our knowledge in Java and gained experience in removing errors in code. We also learned the processes of creating an Android app and the methods of putting the whole layout together. Furthermore, we learned how to work with Muse, and gained insight into the workings of brain waves, and how they differ from person to person.</p>\n<h2>Brainwave Bushido: Forwards and Futurewards</h2>\n<p>Everything runs it's course eventually, some sooner than others. Some end up as dead ends, and some as springboards for a new and better world. Some things are retired for a while, only to eventually return to active duty. This project? We think that it has been an amazing learning experience, and an excellent project to work on. That being said, it goes little further than that. In it's current form, we feel it is largely unsuited for further educational use, as it was a delving into multiple areas, with little focus on one in particular. Perhaps it will be a more suitable project when we have developed our skills more, but perhaps other projects will take out interest. Perhaps it is too early to say either way. For now though, we think that into the wild green yonder, Brainwave Bushido will likely venture. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Developed code and managed code writing efforts.

We wanted to not look at a zombie future, however, but examine a future where society has crumbled and people must band together, share what resources they have, and work towards a common goal to not only save themselves, but rebuild society as a whole. </p>\n<p>More and more young people are interested in sandbox and open-world games, however many set in a dystopian future are the same zombie apocalypse used over and over again. <em>Shattered Future</em> takes a different approach, looking more into a collapsing society and the effects that has on relationships between people.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>Shattered Future</em> is a game based on giving the player a dark and gloomy feel of what the world has fallen to after the society has fallen to ruin. It is a game that combines both communication and exploring, with combat and action.</p>\n<h3>Mechanics</h3>\n<p><strong>Inventory &amp; Loot</strong>: Explore buildings and loot storage compartments such as fridges, stoves, cupboards, and cabinets, to find ammunition, food, and medical supplies. The Inventory has a smart sorting system which will ensure items that can be stacked are stacked in piles, and that when looting items it will sort out the way to fit the most amount of items in your limited inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Experience &amp; Leveling Up</strong>: By doing things such as fighting and using items, your character gains experience, which allows them to level up - giving them new abilities such as increased maximums on health points.</p>\n<p><strong>Combat</strong>: Using weapons such as a pistol, the character can fight hostile enemies throughout the map, and use up ammo along the way - making strategy more important as a simple \"spray-and-pray\" approach would not always prove successful.</p>\n<p><strong>Interaction</strong>: The player can interact with a wide variety of NPCs throughout the map to learn a little bit more about the back-story behind how the world and this region in particular has fallen into such ruin, while also providing some friendly faces in a forest of hostiles.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><em>Shattered Future</em> is built entirely in Java, with art assets created over the course of this weekend. We planned out the idea of the dystopian future, and decided we wanted to mix in a story and communicating with people in this dark world in addition to action and combat. We created a basic framework, and slowly added in features over Saturday and into Sunday.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we ran into was time - some of the final systems were not included, such as the crafting system, which would have given more purpose to some of the more miscellaneous items in the game.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Through it all, we finished plenty of content over the course of this weekend, as we managed to develop our idea much more in comparison to the previous Hack Western. We managed to produce a playable product that can be fun for a little action game put together over the weekend</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Over this weekend, we both learned quite a bit about design and structuring a game \"properly\", and learned the value of communication in a team environment. On the programming side, we learned about how to better optimize code for performance but also for legibility for other programmers, by creating more peer-functions, etc. In addition, we learned how to create basic enemy AI, and how to create a proper inventory and loot system.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Shattered Future</h2>\n<p><em>Shattered Future</em> is built with the future in mind, being easily extendable not only from a map and content point of view, but also in the framework, which is built to be very modular and easily expanded on in the future. We have considered continuing and adding multiplayer among other features, however we have not finalized a plan on that just yet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Mapboy/HackWestern3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Mapboy/HackWestern3\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?kn2834r6svwqeww\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.mediafire.com/?kn2834r6svwqeww\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.mediafire.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the programming aspect of the game, creating the framework from scratch in pure Java with no libraries, and a bit of luck, managed to finish most of our content before the deadline (while still getting some sleep, too!)", "I worked on the game sprites and was part of concepting.

Inspired by theremin, this instrument requires no physical contact to play. Thus, it is great for people who cannot play an instrument due to disorders like arthritis or Parkinsons. Additionally, it is helpful for developing fine motor skills, as a therapeutic medium, or to help with ear training, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Leap motion tracks your hand movements and plays a note accordingly. Using your right hand, you control the frequency, while your left-hand controls volume. To play, all you need to do is pinch your fingers on your right hand. The x-axis controls pitch modulation to produce a vibrato, so by shaking your right hand side to side, you can create a sound that mimics the human voice. This hands-free system has a game mode and free play mode. In game mode, you can follow the purple bar depicted on the screen to play some of your favorite songs, whereas in free play, you are free to create and practice.

On the other hand, some flowers can die of overwatering when you care a little too much for your plants. This app was made for the casual plant-lover who has a hard time watering their plants regularly.</p>\n<p>Made in the memory of one of our team member's gentle Ikea flowers, who died of excess water.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Plantr suggests how often your plants will need watering. After entering which plants you own, it reminds you to water your plants only as often as they need, based on a database of the most commonly-owned plants.</p>\n<p>Other information is also available from within the app, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recommended sunlight exposure</li>\n<li>Descriptions and tips on growing your plants</li>\n<li>Links to various accessories that complement indoor flora</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you miss a day's watering for any reason, you can tell the app to remind you at a later date.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Before any sort of programming, we came together and brainstormed ideas for different kinds of apps. At first, we thought that maybe we'd make some sort of social network but specifically for students to discuss their classes and highlight important notes or links, but we were the most intrigued by an app that would help aspiring gardeners take care of their silent pets. We assigned each other roles to focus on different parts of the app and got to work.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This being our first hackathon, we went into this project completely blind. None of us had any experience building an Android app before, so our biggest challenge was navigating the complexities of app development. It was also a challenge working together as a team, having to synchronise our files as to be able to work on the same version of the application. Although we still don't fully understand the many features of GitHub and Android Studio, we still learned a lot in our collaborative creation process. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Considering our inexperience, we're proud of having produced a prototype close to what we originally intended. Our ability to coordinate and assign different roles was an important factor in our accomplishment, as well as being able to survive a reduction in number and still produce a working product. We learned a lot about Android development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Plantr</h2>\n<p>The UI and the amount of plants in the database are both components we could definitely improve if we were to develop this app further. We could also implement local stores offers of vases and other decorative pieces (\"accessories\") as a way of keeping interest in the app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nlipski/WHackathon/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nlipski/WHackathon/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["ShareFolio", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShareFolio \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/928/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShareFolio \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/929/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Portfolio Graph</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShareFolio \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/925/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Portfolio</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShareFolio \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/926/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Dashboard</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShareFolio \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/923/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Explore</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShareFolio \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/924/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Log In</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShareFolio \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/927/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Settings</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>ShareFolio is inspired by many modern personal finance and investing web applications such as WealthSimple.

We created CookMe, a smartphone application to help reduce food waste, and allow Canadians to save the money lost on discarding expired groceries.</p>\n<p>CookMe provides a way to scan receipts from grocery stores to remember what you have in your kitchen and pantry at home. It logs when your groceries were purchased to help you keep track of expiration dates and reminds you when you have food that is approaching its best before date. </p>\n<p>CookMe also serves as a useful database of your groceries at home. You can use the app to help plan your shopping list and answer the classic question, \"Do we have _____ at home?\" Using its database of your groceries, CookMe also provides suggested recipes based on the ingredients you have in your kitchen, and provides in app access to quick, one-minute recipe videos. </p>\n<p>For those who are always discarding mouldy bread and sour milk, CookMe is the solution to limit waste, save money, and keep your kitchen stocked.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built CookMe using an adapted hackaton-Agile process which involved 4 hour sprints, regular reprioritization and validation with other hackers, sponsors and organizers. </p>\n<p>It's an Android app which leverages the ZXing API to scan QR codes on receipts which it uses to store grocery objects in an SQLite database. CookMe also uses YouTube's public API to query data from Tasty's recipe YouTube videos, which it embeds in the application's UI. The entire project was version controlled through Git.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p><strong>Finding our Market</strong>\nFinding our target audience was difficult since the monetization of the app can operate in multiple ways. On one hand, the app can be grown to users who would be interested in a coupon feature. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, grocery stores may be interested in suggesting products to the customer while they shop, making the product B2B.</p>\n<p><strong>Running multiple threads</strong>\nWhen making <code>https</code> requests through the YouTube API, we had the issue of responses not being received before synchronous intervention. We ended up incorporating an executor service which allowed us to wait for all the tasks to complete before the control signal continued onwards. </p>\n<p><strong>Not Time Boxing Certain Tasks</strong>\nSome original features and UI implementations offer poor value to the customer for the time spent developing them. We ended up dropping some of these features to pursue more valuable ones, however time boxing features is important when working in an environment which thrives on effectuation. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>None of us have worked on an Android application like CookMe. Being able to incorporate an SQL database, embedding YouTube videos, a QR code reader and having a shippable MVP all compose what we are proud of accomplishing during the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Validation is incredibly important when creating a product from the ground up. Working in an Agile enviroment is great for this and allowed us to go back to the drawing board every few hours to make sure we're heading in the right direction. </p>\n<p>KISS - We had plans for implementing AR into the product for our hack. Despite how cool AR is, creating a product that focuses on what the customer cares about should always take precedent. We were able to add much more value to the customer through simple tables and databases than we would have if we used AR.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CookMe</h2>\n<p>A suggested products feature had positive feedback during the hackathon. Being able to suggest products to a customer so that they can try some unique recipes would be beneficial to both grocery stores and customers.</p>\n<p>A coupon integration feature would allow customers to save even more money than if they didn't use our application. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/serant/HackWestern3Project\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/serant/HackWestern3Project\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Eggspire", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Eggspire \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/427/953/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Food poisoning sucks, all illness does.

We had very minimal HTML5 and Javascript experience and so we decided to expand our skillset. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a local client side face-to-face two player game. Each player moves around a box and is able to place walls blocking off the other player. With the map shrinking, and walls limiting movement the players must think quickly and on their feet in order to outwit their opponent. Last person standing wins. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML5 and JavaScript in the Sublime text editor. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was tough trying to figure out collisions without having any physical objects. Making walls prevent character movement was definitely a hard implementation considering we do not have any meshes or colliders. Similarly figuring out if the player was boxed in was also difficult. We also had some issues with optimization where our frame updates took longer to do than the frames refreshed; as such many of our functions were rewritten in order to allow efficiency. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We created a fully functional HTML5, Javascript game from scratch without using any already existing platform makers. Figuring out all the algorithms and seeing them work in the end is something that we are DEFINITELY proud off. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A lot of javascript notation and functional programming.

From there, we just started rapping and decided to make something that would turn our point from notes into raps we could listen to all day every day every week and every year and day and hour and minute and stuff. </p>\n<p>TLDR; We thought we needed to help these poor university students with exams. This is a great tool for cramming and long term studying. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows you to input \"lyrics,\" or in other words just the notes you typed up during class.

Learning was definitely the biggest challenge, but we still learned many things. Let's be honest, it's a miracle this thing works at all.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're super happy we manage to train two ferrets to use graphing calculators to run the server. Oh, and we're also pretty proud that we got it working, that too.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>If nothing else this project certainly fits the theme of learning since we had to learn almost everything about this project. We came in knowing almost nothing, and in the end we now have experience writing server-client applications using javascript and html, as well as ferret training.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hangry Time</h2>\n<p>Being rewritten by people with more experience would be good, but failing that some shinier graphics would be nice.
