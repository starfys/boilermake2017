We set out to make photographic language learning available to anyone with a web-enabled device. For absolutely free, Project Horus brings photo translation ability to the smart phone, laptop, tablet, and pc. On the go and see something you'd like to be able to describe in a different language? Simply go to project-horus.com and take a new photo to be on your way to learning a new language.  </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Using a web app interface, Project Horus allows the user to upload a photo or take a new photo. The user can then select his or her desired region for translation in the photograph by drawing a circle around the item(s) he or she would like translated. The <strong>Clarifai</strong> API is then called to generate the top three tags regarding the image. These three most likely tags are then sent to the <strong>Yandex.translate</strong> API</p>\n<h2>Tech Specs</h2>\n<p>Project Horus is a web app written in plain Javascript and HTML 5. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Image cropping, choosing a computer vision and translate API, </p>\n<h2>What's next for Project-Horus</h2>\n<p>We plan to add more translation languages through Google's Translate API and add a new computer vision algorithm to get more accurate vocabulary tags. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yandex.translate</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://project-horus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://project-horus.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>project-horus.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I pretty much made this entire website - front end, back end, AWS, API integration, Javascript selection tool, etc. Max was just asleep on the floor the whole hackathon.

It allows people who do not want to work alone on their individual projects to find a creative environment to work in on demand. With CoWork24 people never have to work alone anymore. The data collected about people's favourite places and what time they usually go there can be used for businesses to target them and offer individualized special offers tailored to their needs.

For example finding a street with a high number of collisions you can visit it and notice that the road needs to be paved, or the change in traffic light are quicker than normal. By using our application we can identify a potential problem and leave it up to the user to investigate or speak up on behalf of a community that would desperately need some change in their road in order to keep people safe and lower the hundreds of NYPD or ambulence calls that occur everyday. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nyc-open-data\">nyc-open-data</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chart-js\">chart.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fazlayrabbi/NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collision_Report\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fazlayrabbi/NYPD_Motor_Vehicle_Collision_Report\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["encabulator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>It was late.

I'm really, REALLY proud of getting this all tied together - there was a point at 7:00 where I didn't think I would make it to demo.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Don't trust Cordova.</p>\n<p>I jest :) It was really cool to work with clarifai's api and I'm sure that I'll use it in the future.

All you have to do is input the URL of a picture of your choice. Click \"Go!\" and in a few seconds, your mysterious (but delicious-looking) food item will be identified and you'll have a list of nearby restaurants where you can go get your food.</p>\n<p>Our next steps are to allow image uploads, map restaurants out for users, and incorporate user feedback on the accuracy of our identifications in order to provide better results in the future.
