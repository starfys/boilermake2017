By morphing it into a fun-filled road trip! We wanted to provide a service that allows you to explore and discover different things to do along the way from point A to point B. Our goal is to make your road trip planning as streamlined as possible.</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>First, you begin by inputting your starting location and your destination. Then, our service will populate clusters of lists with suggestions of activities/places to see along the way. Simply check off the locations that you wish to stop by and you will be re-routed to automatically include those in your path. </p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We utilized the Google Maps API to generate the map and route you to your destination. We then used the Google Places API to search for prominent points of interest along your route. Once you make your selections, they are reflected in the route. We used GitHub for source control and Microsoft Azure for hosting. Our GitHub repository was set up to push directly to Azure, greatly simplifying deployment.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for RouteIt</h2>\n<p>Our service works for the general cases. However there are edge cases that RouteIt does not cover.\nThe Google Maps API limits the number of waypoints which it will transform into a path to no more than eight waypoints. To use more, the API requires payment. Therefore for the purposes of this demo, a maximum of eight waypoints will be selected. If the locations are too close together than the radius of our calls for nearby places can overlap and repeat suggested locations. So for the purposes of this demonstration we will be using locations more than 60 miles apart. We have also not handled if the locations are the same place.</p>\n<p>Some features we would like to add in are allowing the user to delete choices from the suggested locations, and to add filters such as restaurants, attractions, or landmarks. We would also like to add descriptions to each suggested location in a drop down tab so that the user can browse before choosing, as that is not implemented at the moment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/font-awesome\">font-awesome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mui</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://tamuhack15roadtrip.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tamuhack15roadtrip.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tamuhack15roadtrip.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kaveet/tamuhack-roadtrip.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kaveet/tamuhack-roadtrip.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked with the Google Places Autocomplete API and the MUI Material Design CSS framework to help provide a more intuitive UI.

inspiration came from the opening keynote speech from Walmart. He mentioned disasters and hurricanes, and we realized that in those types of situations, it can sometimes be hard to coordinate disaster relief and aid due to a lack of electricity (wifi) and cellular towers (cell signals). Therefore, we decided to create this interesting iOS application to assist in these types of situations. In the process of creating this application, we also realized other practical uses, including being able to communicate with strangers at gatherings such as sporting events.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ProxyChat utilizes the iOS feature of multipeer connectivity to daisy chain multiple iOS devices together, in order to create a mesh network in order to allow offline communication between people nearby.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We utilized swift and multipeer connectivity, as well as using photoshop and other prototyping tools to help us quickly bootstrap and get off the ground.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into issues with implementing some APIs, and also due to our relatively little experience with hackathons and iOS development in general, we had a lot to learn.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our challenge was also our greatest accomplishment. We definitely learned a lot,  and were able to apply what we learned in order to create a completed hackathon submission within the course of 24 hours! :)</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about iOS development, as well as working together as a team and solving tough challenges.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ProxyChat</h2>\n<p>ProxyChat does not end at TAMUHacks. We realize the importance and benefits of a tool like ProxyChat, and plan to continue development so that we can release a finalized product to the general public.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">multipeerconnectivity</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">prepo</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dingwilson/ProxyChat\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dingwilson/ProxyChat\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Rev's Warriors", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Rev's Warriors \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/735/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The Alabama game </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Reveille is moved by the user clicking on a direction button and she \"attacks\" the other teams mascot.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Lot's of googling and deMorgan's Laws</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Implementing a collision</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating an android app with little experience in Android Studio</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to draw graphics onto an Android screen</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rev's Warriors</h2>\n<p>Correction of current bugs and expanding to more levels.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["TaskMate", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMate \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/784/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMate \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/785/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMate \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/786/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMate \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/787/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our inspiration came from workout tracking applications.

You can then assign members to each task. After all setups are complete, a summary page is shown to display who has finished which task by the assigned deadline. If the completed check box is not checked, an automatic push notification will be displayed to every team member to remind the team member to do his/her job. The push notification will also have an option to message the team mate through email, text messaging, and other popular forms of communication.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>For the front-end, we were building Android application with Google Android Studio.\nFor the back-end, we used Microsoft Azure mobile services.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Except one, rest of the member didn't have much experience in programming.\nThis was the first time that we are actually using Microsoft Azure.\nThe biggest problem was that we didn't have ability to estimate the workload of the project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even this was the first time to use Microsoft Azure, we were able to send and store the data inside of the Microsoft Azure server.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We always need to make a decent design document for better development process.\nBefore this, we need to estimate the work load of the project and should not overestimate the ability.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TaskMate</h2>\n<p>We need to finish the rest of the part of this application.\nWe were planning to build a web-based version too.\nFurthermore, we need a great designer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["CashTracker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashTracker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/799/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashTracker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/800/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashTracker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/801/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashTracker \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/802/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I have a problem with impulse buying, especially on the internet, I made this to encourage people to think about, or at the very least, prepare for the affect a purchase will have on your bank account.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Whenever you're browsing walmart.com or amazon.com and you go to a product page or (only on walmart.com) your cart, a little button will light up in the corner of your screen.

This causes major back pain, eye strain and all the life threatening side effects that come with this. By also sitting at your computer 24/7, you become much less productive by either drowsing off or just not paying as much attention. We created at tool to help solve this.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> HealthyHacker monitors keystrokes and mouse movements and, depending on the type of person at the computer (developer, designer, or anyone else) analyzes their activity while working and keeps an eye on how long the user is staying in one place. You can think HealthyHacker being similar as the alarm clocks that keep from going off during your deep sleep. HealthyHacker pushes you to take a break by stretching, socializing and relaxing but not during your most productive moments.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>HealthyHacker is built on top of Github's Electron framework, to provide a hybrid desktop application experience. This allows for faster build times, as developers can develop once and deploy to multiple platforms. Being a hybrid application, HealthyHacker utilizes the popular Angular.js framework along with bootstrap, charts.js, restful web services, parse, and several others.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into multiple challenges building HealthyHacker.

Sully Potter brings pretend magic fights to a whole new level. Using built in phone sensors and the IBM BlueMix servers we created an mage battle app that allowed users to say 'spells' (voice recognition) while waving their 'wand' (motion detection on the phone) to either attack the other player or heal themselves. This would emulate a grand wizards battle with the phones acting as wands. We wanted our idea to be simple enough to reasonably implement within the scope of the hackthon, but also have to potential to organically grow and expand as we add more features in the future. </p>\n<p>We needed many different elements to make this idea work. We needed backend developers to set up the voice recognition and to make sure the phones could communicate with each-other via the server. We needed an android app developer to create an intuitive and simple interface that could make use of the signals between devices and logic of the game itself.  We also needed a designer to create visually interesting and consistent animated images for the spells that would make the game fun and exciting to play. </p>\n<p>We hope in the future to add several new features to this game in the future.

As a result, we started brainstorming clever ways to use that energy to power apps. Our seed of an idea <em>germinated</em> and <em>blossomed</em> into <strong>Yell It Up!</strong> which allows sports fans and general enthusiasm junkies to enjoy a similar <em>high</em> energy, <em>high</em> stakes feeling even while away from Kyle Field. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Yell It Up!</strong> allows users to put their excitement to the test in a <em>daring</em> challenge of vocal mettle. The game's protagonist is controlled by the volume of user vocal inputs which provides for an <em>engaging</em> way to interact with otherwise touch controlled environments.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the iOS development language, Swift, in order to create the application. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>My team experienced significant difficulty with implementing sound input into movement input.

Throughout the football season, social media is packed with students asking to borrow sports passes or offering to lend them. We saw a need for a way for students looking for a sports pass for a game to be paired with students who wouldn't be using theirs. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SportSwap is a mobile application that facilitates the process of lending sports passes and puts students in direct communication with each other to make these transfers. It allows students to set the games that they will not be using their own sports pass, as well as request to borrow a sports pass for specific games. The available sports passes are posted to a feed on the home page of the app where students can directly request to borrow them from the offering users. In-app messaging will allow the students to communicate about the meeting time and location to pick up the pass. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>After the initial brainstorming, our team fleshed out the details on paper and sketched out each possible screen view. We planned out all of the content and all of the features and actions the users could take. We then split up to create the back-end using Microsoft Azure and the front-end using Java. After we had a basic skeleton for both, we integrated these two programs and added features.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The android platform was not altogether foreign to our team when we arrived, but it did prove to be quite a powerful adversary all the same. This was also the first time that any of us had used a cloud computing platform. Despite the problems we faced, our team stayed strong and persevered to the very end.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of each other and of our peers. We are proud that we finished what we came here to start. We are proud that we could be a part of such a wonderful community of people.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to work better as a team, how to accept help from others when we truly need it, and how to have a blast for an entire twenty-four hours. We all have a deeper knowledge of the Android and Azure platforms. Most importantly, we learned about this great experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SportSwap</h2>\n<p>We plan to expand the application to Apple and Windows devices, as well as develop a desktop version. The framework of SportSwap can be used at other universities, as well as applied to broader spheres such as NFL games and concert venues. After further development, we plan to approach the 12th Man Foundation to work with them to incorporate SportSwap into the A&amp;M student football experience and promote Aggies helping other Aggies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["PausePlease", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PausePlease \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/845/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PausePlease \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/846/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PausePlease \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/850/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PausePlease \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/851/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PausePlease \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/301/852/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The idea for PausePlease came from when Jeff Zhao was eating pizza on this one fine day and didn't want to get pizza on his hands while he was watching league of legends.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PausePlease pauses your currently playing videos when you look away, and reminds you to take your eyes away from the computer to relieve stress from your eyes, to get away from the computer when you've been sitting down for too long, and reminds you of events on your google calendar so you don't forget while you're watching movies.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used IR sensors to detect the IR transmitters we mounted on glasses.

This also caters to the needs of under weight people, advising them how much more to eat to improve their weight.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Depending on the time of the day, the web app gives you the correct kind of meal depending upon your sex, weight, age and workout regime. for ex: if it is 8 am in the morning, it is time for breakfast. This web app makes all kinds of breakfast available and then returns few choices depending on your calculated BMI, BMR and workout regime. The web app then returns the lowest price of each ingredient available at Walmart. In this way, this app allows people to count both their calories and their money.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used an API provided by the Spoonocular webite, hosted by Mashape, using it to find recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. This app also gave information about the calories present in the snack. The app is then directed to Walmart's Search api, which then gives the minimum price of each individual ingredient available. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we faced were related to development of the app. We are graduate students of elctrical engineering and didnt have much experience related to app development. We first used IBM Blue Mix services to code in Node JS. But we faced many roadblocks there. We then tried the same using PHP but were once again unsuccessful. Finally we implemented it using pearl. Apart from that we also ran into challenges mainly related to the feasibility of the idea. How i could use the API's available while making people health conscious and also allowing them to value their money in a positive way. We used body parameters and workout regimes to come up with various parameters like BMI and BMR which tell a person how much to eat to remain or become healthy. And the entire calculation happens internally, just advising the person about the calories they might take in and the various choices they may have. This also takes care of the much needed variety required for day to day activities.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>First of all we are very proud that we were able to successfully implement it even though we faced many roadblocks.\nThe way in which we have calculated the BMI and BMR using the input parameters and then advising the person about the food they may have along with the choices they can make will have a huge positive impact on many people, making them better at managing health and also getting them the prices so that they are not only health conscious but also money wise</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned different ways of viewing a problem depending on the resources available.

How cool would it be to be able to score and track arm wrestling games? The once I finished the watch code I realized that this could be a great social game. By adding the online component it can be competitive with friends and fun for onlookers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Wrastle is a score keeper and referee for arm wrestling matches and can additionally display this to an online score board!</p>\n<p>The watch component of Wrastle tracks the angle of the player's wrist to track the progress of an arm wrestling match. When either player's arm goes down to the table for at least a second it counts a win for either red or blue, with red being the player wearing the watch if it on their right hand. During the match a progress bar will actively show the how close each player is to a victory with the display shifting colors to red or blue.</p>\n<p>The online scoreboard displays the same information as the watch app, namely score and game progress, in a much larger format suitable for onlookers to see a live update of the game progress. This would be fantastic for an event where there are many people watching the match, such as professional tournaments, and not everyone has a clear view of the action itself. The online scoreboard is designed to look good at any size whether it is a friend checking in on their phone, or a projector on the wall.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The watch app was built using Pebble's C API, as well as an integrated Javascript component which provides the internet connectivity. When programming I used the CloudPebble editor which is designed specifically for writing watch apps in a constant integration fashion. The Javascript component runs on the users phone if connected over bluetooth and receives information about game progress and score from the watch, which is then forwards to the web server hosting the online scoreboard. </p>\n<p>The web application was written with Javascript, using AngularJS and bootstrap for the front end, and Socket.io to enable the client to recieve score and progress updates from the web server in real time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The first hurdle was to learn the Pebble C API, which is admittedly a little obtuse. It is designed from the ground up to be maximally efficient with the watches resources, so compared to modern GUI frameworks, it provides very little to the user. Things like shapes, position calculations, and brushes all have to be managed by the user. </li>\n<li>The second challenge was getting a well tuned system of reading an interpreting the accelerometer readings which would accurately tell the progress of the game. I focused on creating a system which would be direct and intuitive while eliminating false positives and negatives.</li>\n<li> Communication between the web server and client was a new challenge for me, but luckily my friends were able to point me toward socket.io, which made it fairly straightforward task.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The application was fun a challenging the make, but I am most proud of bringing a little bit of laughter to TAMU Hack. Once I completed the watch app, I had to test it, which meant going around and arm wrestling anyone and everyone. When the judges can by, I would say \"I'll show you my app, but we are going to have to arm wrestle\" and they would always get a kick out of that. I lost nearly every single match, but I felt like a winner at heart.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I learned about making graphical interfaces which the fancy frameworks</li>\n<li>I learned how to integrate applications across components running different languages.

This is never a constant; it seems that many bus rides are smooth, but some quite jarring.  We wanted to discover the ultimate problem behind this, and hopefully clarify a way to making bus rides more pleasant.</p>\n<p>Our hack, called Brake Analysis, comprises of a  Spark Core with accelerometer which reports the number of notable acceleration changes experienced over the course of a bus route circuit- from the beginning to end of a single looped route starting on A&amp;M campus.  These results are compiled and compared later so that trends may be observed; say, that a particular bus driver hits the brakes hard, or a specific bus has its brakes hit hard often by a range of drivers, indicating possible mechanical problems.</p>\n<p>This hack is built physically out of a Spark Core chip combined with an accelerometer, and will require some power source in field testing.  Code is done in Java (for Servlet design) and C (for accelerometer result collection), and put together in the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform.  Specifically, a Mobile Service which compiles results taken from bus trips.</p>\n<p>This hack was difficult to implement for us because we were previously unfamiliar with all of the software and hardware involved, and had not attempted projects in this line before.  During development, as none of us had previously worked with Microsoft Azure, we spent a good deal of time working of unnecessary avenues which were not ultimately productive; a good deal of time was spent learning how to better direct our efforts.  The programming itself proved difficult in the need to implement checks in the Spark Core which ensured that it cleared its memory after each run (due to limited storage space), but only when in range of appropriate signal (so that it successfully writes entries to memory, and does not delete them forever).</p>\n<p>Numerous challenges were overcame during the creation of this hack, and our group learned a good deal.  We now are much more comfortable with the Azure services, and with combining hardware experimentation with software implementation in order to tackle more realistic problems than may be encountered in class.  </p>\n<p>Ideally, our hack could be used to identify possible problems in A&amp;M bus routes, or expanded to similar uses further afield.

Currently, the search engine requires multiple inputs from the user after an initial search has been made. This program would be an alternative for the users who already know the factors they have in mind, and would allow them to make one \u201ceasy search\u201d to find the best product for them. Also, this program would search for multiple products at the same time. For example, while someone searches for oranges, a bicycle, a chair, and a car tire, the program would run the searches for the other products in the backend, while the UI would only show oranges, and display different filters the user can quickly choose from to narrow their results. While this is happening, the program would search for the other products and keep their filters ready for the user, so the user can quickly do the other searches also. </p>\n<p>This program would greatly boost customer happiness for those who do not need to select multiple filters after a search for one product, and then repeat that process for other products also. However, from the viewpoint of Walmart as a business, the company would not really profit from this in anyway because the program does not generate additional revenue. </p>\n<p>Description of final idea:\nWe then moved to the idea of creating a search engine that allows users to describe or write a sentence about a product they recently saw outside of Walmart that they do not know the name of. A very basic example is someone who recently saw someone else playing a videogame he/she enjoyed, but does not know the name of the game. Describing this product to this search engine would allow users to more likely find the game. When the user inputs the description, they engine would collect keywords from the sentence, such as a \u201cfirst person shooter\u201d, \u201cfighting alien races\u201d and \u201cnew game\u201d along with other specific details the user can input to describe the game. The engine would send the keywords to IBM\u2019s Watson and Watson would send back the game title if it could narrow it down to one result. Otherwise, Watson would send the keywords to Google\u2019s API or Yelp\u2019s API to find similar reviews of people who have used the same or similar keywords to describe the product. When a common product is found, the API used would send back the name of the product to Walmart who would find that product in its own API and display that to the user. </p>\n<p>This program would solve the issue of bringing in additional revenue because the user would now be able to search and find that product with a simple UI directly from Walmart\u2019s website, and then buy it from Walmart. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["TAMuHack_Walmart", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to create a web app that allowed Wal-mart customers to view the value of the day as well as the trendy items.

Our inspiration was drawn from this fact, and our goal was to help facilitate the lives of people who are unable to communicate with the people around them. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TalkGlobal is a language translating app.  It allows two users who do not speak the same language to communicate, by first detecting the typed language of one, then translating to the desired language of the other. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>TalkGlobal is an android app developed in Android Studios.  We utilized IBM's Bluemix framework, drawing from Watson's A.I. algorithms to detect the language of the user's input and to complete the translation.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Using Bluemix was a brand new notion to most of the group, and using the API in Android development certainly steepened the learning curve.  In addition, only one member of our team had participated in a hackathon previous to TAMUHack 2015.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Most notable of our accomplishments at TAMUHack 2015 is our ability to work as a team.  Each member played a key role in the planning, development, and success of the hack, including one member who had a total of one month of coding experience prior to the event.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>In addition to learning a great deal about scripting and markup languages, we learned how to work with existing API's and frameworks to build a product.  We also learned some excellent techniques involving planning and executing a project in a hackathon environment.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TalkGlobal</h2>\n<p>At this point, TalkGlobal can recognize a typed language and translates it text-to-text.  In the future, TalkGlobal will not only be able to translate speech into a desired language, but will be able to detect which language is being spoken and translate it into the appropriate text and/or speech.  With this, users need not even know what language the other is speaking; communication will truly become a seamless process.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]]]
