Not everyone has a smartphone in their hand and the ability to answer any possible question in their back pocket. That's what makes Textor so important. </p>\n<p>We're giving  a huge and commonly unrepresented group of people the resources that can unlock so many doors and create immense change. Think of all the activity websites like Bing, Twitter, Facebook, etc. have sparked. Now think of all of the people in the world without access to such innovative technologies. </p>\n<p>This is where Textor comes in. </p>\n<p>With Textor users can access search engines, personal accounts, and work related apps without the need of a smartphone. Users can also directly send tweets, search through Bing or broadcast group messages without the luxury of internet access.</p>\n<p>Another important use of Textor comes during emergency situations. Our team has linked hardware and software to create what we call a broadcast button. In just one touch of a button users can send automatic distress signals or broadcast messages to groups. So not only is Textor an extremely innovative search engine and social media tool, but also an incredibly useful piece of medical equipment.</p>\n<p>Textor is, at the very core, a platform for innovative SMS applications to enable communications without the need of the Internet. In other words, it's an app store for SMS applications. Textor provides a set of APIs so developers can easily add an app of their own logic to the platform and everything should just work. This simplifies developer's workload and gives users a seamless experience when it comes to SMS applications. In turn, a ecosystem will be built around Textor giving its users even more benefits.</p>\n<p>To complement Textor, we build a web dashboard where users can log in and do various tasks that feels intuitive on a web interface. For example, users can see what they've searched on Bing so far. Users can also use the Fast Response app, together with the broadcast button, to monitor their loved ones' activities and be instantly notified if an emergency comes up. </p>\n<p>Some future works would be to expose the APIs so 3rd party developers can easily add an app to the store and users can easily install it. We're also thinking of letting users linking their Facebook account and other social media sites so they can have an online social presence without the need for the Internet. Hardware interactions with Textor is also an interesting and practical topic because places where there's little to none access to the Internet or smartphones, SMS shines as a connection bridge between a piece of hardware to another.</p>\n<p>We use Node.js for the back-end that powers the app store and serves the users. Twilio is the vendor of choice when it comes to SMS services. Our front-end is built with Angularjs and everything is hosted with Azure Virtual Machine. Raspberry Pi helped us create the broadcast button feature.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing\">bing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/picmonkey\">picmonkey</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/behance\">behance</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">button</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">plottablejs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kpcbbuildforgood\">kpcbbuildforgood</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked fully on the design and UI/UX of the webpage, front-end of the webpage, all of the graphics content (including making the team's logo to a 3d model that is displayed during the presentation), full separate presentation page (want to learn more web page) and strategizing for the presentation.", "I worked on the back-end and front-end, using Nodejs and Angularjs.

The internet is great tool for learning but often times it serves as more of a distraction than a useful tool. We believe that by rewarding people for their hard work, we can create a more well-rounded mindset in regards to the internet. In the end our product aims to make people more aware of their level of physical activity and their browsing habits amidst their busy days.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We combined a chrome extension with a pebble and an android app, in order to realize our hack.\nThrough Google's \"Google Fit,\" we were able to obtain a measurement of how active someone is using Google's built-in pedometer and other Google Fit tools.</p>\n<p>With the Pebble we took a different approach and instead looked at their Geo-locative capabilities. Although the Pebble is sparse in sensors we believed that this would be apt for hikers, or people who simply want to stroll around their town. By periodically tracking GPS coordinates and calculating distance traveled between the points, we were able to come up with what we believe is a good exchange rate between physical activity and internet activity. </p>\n<p>We then combined these two different ways to track physical activity with a Chrome Extension that limits the time spent on the internet.</p>\n<p>For every 300 (can be changed) feet walked, a user receives five or so minutes of internet time. This exchange rate is easily customizable for people's individual needs. These minutes constitute \"free time\" during which the user can browse anywhere they like, but as soon as they have consumed all of their free time, the websites go back to being blocked. We believe that this will encourage people to at least stand up and stretch their limbs and discourage users from excessively browsing their facebook feed.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Because of the wide range of hardware and software that we were targeting and the new api's that we were consuming, there always seemed to be a steep learning curve. The Pebble's unique form factor also offered an interesting challenge in terms of design and utilizing said form-factor to the best of our abilities.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>The four of us made it through the night. We learned a lot, and were able to explore outside our programming comfort zones.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that a lot can be accomplished in 24hrs but that planning ahead is very important. </p>\n<h2>What's next for timeOut!</h2>\n<p>We hope to expand our app to include iOS and other fitness devices. We also hope to fine tune our designs and implement some of the features that we sadly had to leave out. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

Pebble Watch / MUSE hack</h1>\n<p>One major cause of road accidents is driving fatigue. There are currently no solutions on the market effectively addressing the problem. We have developed an app. \"NeuroAlert\" that detects when a person is fatigued and dosing off using EEG signals from the Muse brain sensing headband. The person is then alerted with a vibration on the pebble watch. This app can be used by drivers to prevent accidents from driving fatigue. Also, students can use this app while studying, in class or engaging in high focus need activities to prevent them from dosing off. Our tracking of the brain activity of a person throughout the day could be used to detect they are person is stressed based on the levels of their brainwaves. </p>\n<p>Additionally, using this same technology, we have created a fun simple game. The game mimics a classic staring contest between two players, but the Muse headband is used to detect when a player blinks and loses. The duration of the game and win/loss is reported back to the players on their Pebble watches. </p>\n<p>Both projects are using a basic android app to coordinate between the Muse headband and the Pebble watch. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andrewjmeier/NeuroAlert\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/andrewjmeier/NeuroAlert\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["DataRift", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We thought of DataRift while searching for a way to use Virtual Reality to address a real world problem. 3D Visualization is an ideal method for concisely displaying massive amounts of data in a manner that encourages continuous thought. A 360 degree field of vision, combined with an infinite sandbox, means that any data is just a head turn away. One visualization that inspired us in particular is armsglobe.chromeexperiments.com. We believe this style of visualization has the potential to be even more effective in Virtual Reality. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>DataRift takes in, processes and displays various CSV files. We conceptualized DataRift as an quick and concise aggregate of international relations data. DataRift uses Three.js, which is built on top of WebGL, and WebVR to run this Virtual Reality visualization within the browser. The trackpad or mouse can be used to rotate the selected globe. The arrow keys are used to rotate the other globes into selection, and 'r' and 'e' can be used to further manipulate the selected globe. Each globe represents one country and its top ten import and export partners (by the monetary value of the exchange). Lines between countries represent exports and imports with blue and red, and the magnitude of the line represents the amount of money involved. Currently, the four countries supported are China, France, Japan, and the United States. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Displaying text accurately, navigating the challenges of local coordinate systems rotated within a larger context, and displaying the data concisely were some of the challenges we dealt with.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It's awesome to have a (relatively) finished product! It's so fun just to use it and learn from our own creation. We're proud to be involved in a new area of information visualization, which we believe has an incredible amount of as yet unrealized potential.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Three.js! Although everyone on the team has WebGL experience, none of us had worked with Three.js before. It's also our first time working on the Rift together.</p>\n<h2>What's next for DataRift</h2>\n<p>The original plan was actually more involved than what we currently have. We'd like each globe to display an aggregate of many different types of international relations data, such as energy, immigration, and treaties. Then, upon pushing enter, the selected globe could expand into several different globes representing each of these data types. By providing this increased depth of analysis, we believe DataRift could become a tool that would even be useful for professionals dealing with international investment and policy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webgl\">webgl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webvr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">data.gov</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/jamespeterthornton/HackDartmouth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/jamespeterthornton/HackDartmouth\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Flashcards ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Upload the unpacked extension, and click the lightning bolt icon.

At Colby students without cars rely on \u201cThe Jitney\u201d, a shuttle service, for all their off campus needs. In the past it\u2019s been difficult to rely on, as it\u2019s impossible to know the current location of the Jitney. Planning a short trip into town turned into a day long journey, with no way to know when the jitney would be available next. We were inspired by the struggles of our fellow students to make OnTrack, a simple cross platform app and web extension that allows a user (Leader) to broadcast their location to everyone who knows the name of the broadcast. Monitoring the jitney is as simple as the driver opening the app on their phone when they start a shift, and providing all potential users with the name of their session. We see the potential use cases stretching beyond Waterville, Maine, from tour guides herding their groups from place to place, to road trips, to the sharing of locations between friends. We hope you enjoy using it as much we enjoyed making it!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The first iteration of On Track allows its users to create a \"session\" to broadcast their location to many people with a simple passcode or passphrase. When the (Android &amp; iOS) App is launched, a user is able to become a \"Leader\" (black sheep) or a \"Follower\" (white sheep). </p>\n<p>If Leader is selected, a prompt will request a unique passphrase and update the backend database with a new active session that will broadcast the leader's position. The leader's gps coordinates will periodically be pushed to the server until he or she closes the session. </p>\n<p>If Follower is selected, a similar prompt will require a valid passphrase of an active session, then the follower will be able to track or follow an existing leader. The followers will be able to see themselves relative to the leader and can follow the session until it is closed or when they leave. </p>\n<p>There is also a web app, which is a \"Follow\" only implementation for the folks who don't have iOS and Android smart devices. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating a cross platform app required us create a backend that was compatible with the technologies we wanted to utilize. After considering various database options, we decided to use the Parse framework due to its simplicity. However, we ran into a number of challenges regarding acquiring, querying, and parsing through data in an asynchronous manner. </p>\n<p>Due to the heavy use of location services, we had to optimize our algorithm to conserve battery. We tackled this challenge measuring the change of rate in respect to the change in distance. A low rate meant that the user was not moving as fast, therefore we did not need to update the back end as frequently. On the other hand, a high rate meant more calls to the back end with new GPS coordinates. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I\u2019m really proud of how we managed to come together for our first hackathon and create not only one, but three compatible applications to maximize the convenience of those who wish to use it. I\u2019ve personally never finished an iOS app in such a short time, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever made an app that looked this good. Our android developers worked closely with me and our chrome extension designed to ensure the api stayed standard throughout the platforms.

We were inspired by a mentor to address the communication gap that many mute or deaf people experience by creating an app to help convert sign language to visible words or phrases for almost anyone to understand.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Our Android app works with the Myo armband, which utilizes accelerational, rotational, gyroscopic, and EMG data to determine several complex gestures that may be used in American Sign Language. First, the user must train the app to recognize sign language gestures. The training data is then used by the app to recognize the gestures unique to the user. The gesture is converted into a word and the word is read out loud via TextToSpeeech. Although this would require some cooperation and work from the user, we believe that it is a step closer towards an easier future.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>One of our biggest difficulties was simply the Myo armband itself. It was buggy and difficult to keep a connect. It's own built-in gestures were not reliably recognized. The Myo's issues carried further by making machine learning of gestures extremely difficult. But perhaps more challenging was dealing with Weka,  a machine learning software that we used. Its classes and functions were simply unintuitive and much of our time was spent simply understanding and making Weka work the way we wanted to.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> We are proud that despite the most frustrating of problems (Hi Weka), we did not give up.

I started with tictactoe and managed to keep on building on it and generalized it to a very open state now. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The board games keep track of the moves that the player enters and based on the rules associated with the particular game of tictactoe the user chooses, it decides whether the game is won or not after every move. While it's not won the game will keep on going until a draw occurs.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the tictactoe board generalized into ascii was quite challenging.\nAlso, the when I generalized the amount of X's or O's in a row that one can win with working through the logic was tricky because of the new diagonal ways to win, but I got it working. It was also a little bit tricky testing the diagonals of connect four, but I got that done as well.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I spent 20 hours coding this, it works exactly as planned, and I have no memory leaks!  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that despite the fact C is an old language, one can still make fun, enjoyable programs with it. One needn't have latest access to the newest technologies to build something cool, although such access does tend to enable one to make cool things.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CGames</h2>\n<p>I may think about look-ahead algorithms for tictactoe, but it may be difficult considering the current open, general form of the tictactoe game.

In scenarios with long-term payoffs and short-term temptations, it's difficult to stay on track.  Helpify can help!  You tell us what challenges you're facing, and we scrape web and send you tips via email and text throughout the day.  That way you don't have to constantly look up tips yourself.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>You fill out a really quick form on our website.  The form asks for your email address, phone number, and a couple key words on a problem you're facing.  Helpify uses those keywords to search using Bing API for relevant articles.  Then the articles are summarized, and a couple sentences are sent via email and text to the user.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Sending emails on a timer proved difficult using the command line.  What may help to ameliorate this problem is to 1) create a queue of quotes to send out to specific people at specific times and then 2) launch a separate thread which polls the time and pops jobs off the queue at the appropriate times.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that were proud of</h2>\n<p>We planned our project really well.  We identified a need that many of us had, outlined an achievable set of features to code, and then apportioned tasks well.  Everything came together really smoothly because of good communication and sharing areas of expertise.  Most importantly, we had a great time and learned a lot of new things.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use many new APIs, such as the Bing API and text summarization API.  We also learned how to use php and launch command line processes from within a Python script to send email and texts.  In addition, by searching for tools that we could leverage, we learned a lot about the space of text summarization.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Helpify</h2>\n<p>We'd like to add a feature that allows users to identify times of the day or locations where temptation strikes.  For example, if somebody is looking for weight loss help, and usually snacks when coming home after a long day of work, we can send a reminder to reach for fruits and veggies instead of junk food.  That would involve using location services as a first step.  For finer-tuned assistance, we could use items such as wearables and sensors that identify when texts should be sent to encourage users to stay on track.</p>\n<p>We also want to start creating an online community for people using our site.  We already publish popular tips online.  By using upvote/downvote features, we can apply machine learning to the task of providing people with better tips.   We can also use bag of words and simple machine learning models to identify sections within self-help articles that hold tips to better the quality of the messages we send out.  Finally, while this website mobile compatible, it would be more convenient to make it a native phone app.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing\">bing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/smmry\">smmry</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-search-api\">bing-search-api</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JamesBrofos/Helpify\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JamesBrofos/Helpify\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Whiteboard++", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Whiteboard++ \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/408/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Whiteboard++ \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/407/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Ever coded on a whiteboard for an interview?

A peer to peer mobile application, centralized distribution network, desktop application and\ncomputation-specific API will be created to develop a working proof of concept.</p>\n<h2>Rationale</h2>\n<p>The main problem with alternative currencies such as Bitcoin is that the computation required to\nproduce the currency ultimately is wasted. One solution would be to use established distributed\ncomputation models to produce a currency that would then be distributed among those who performed\nthe computations. The concept of \u201cproof of work\u201d is defined by the end-user organization and thus\nregulated to ensure fairness when determining the value of the currency being produced. Non-profit\norganizations will benefit from the results of crowd-sourced computation as well as have a currency that\ncan be directly traded to help fund their efforts. Non-profit organizations can greatly benefit from\ndistributed computing, but a distributing computation platform is needed and this is what ComputeCoin can provide.</p>\n<h2>Language</h2>\n<p>The current iteration of the product (one present as of the time of this commit) is done with HTML, PHP, and Javascript. Compuation is modeled in javascript\non a single server and merely emulates peers being spun up, executing, and then returning their result. Moving forward, the front end and API will remain largely\nthe same in terms of design, but will most likely communicate with a more powerful and dynamic server backend platform.</p>\n<p>One key component is the computation. Extending solutions externally to the end user organization is the best way to ensure code is optimized properly for\nthe distributed computing. The end user does not need to specify how the data and job queues will be distributed - they merely interface with the ComputeCoin backend\nas if it were a single platform.</p>\n<h2>Considerations</h2>\n<p>Distributed computation solutions generally have the luxury of being within the same network and the entire organization owns all of the hardware.\nComputeCoin will most likely incorporate a slave</p>\n<p>Peer to peer transfer of this currency must be centralized to ensure the authenticity and credibility of\nthe currency in use.</p>\n<p>Computations must be distributed evenly and linearly to peers to ensure computation can be easily\nmapped among peers.</p>\n<p>The API must allow the end-user organizations to expressively describe how their computation shall take\nplace, but be able to be reduced down in order to be distributed among peers.</p>\n<p>The API must restrict the type of data used as input and output (result) to allow for the centralized\nnetwork to manage currency distribution.</p>\n<p>Computation results returned by peers must be hashed uniquely by both the end-user organization\u2019s\nkey as well as the centralized distribution network\u2019s key.</p>\n<h2>Assumptions</h2>\n<p>In order for the distribution of currency to remain fair, the process in which the computation is\ndistributed must be normalized across all end-user organizations.</p>\n<p>Each distributed set of computation is regulated and tied directly to the amount of currency being\nproduced per peer.</p>\n<p>Peer identity, currency transfers, centralized distributed network integrity, and other operations need to be done securely, but for this purposes of this proof of concept are not.</p>\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of design desicions and either implicitly or explicitly avoids complexity and makes assumptions about how elements may work in the future in an effort to simply the design enough to be developed into a proof of concept. The project will start with a limited number of peers and end-user organizations, a single CDN, and a very limited set of peers computation will be distributed to. Other considerations and assumptions are stated above.</p>\n<h3>Mobile Application</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage peer identities</li>\n<li>Receive distribution of currency from centralized network</li>\n<li>Store distributed currency</li>\n<li>Send currency to peer</li>\n<li>Receive currency from peer</li>\n<li>Interface with desktop application to manage computation preference</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Centralized Distribution Network</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage end-user organizations</li>\n<li>Manage peer addresses</li>\n<li>Process API calls among end-user organizations</li>\n<li>Distribute computation among peers</li>\n<li>Distribute currency to peers</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Desktop Application</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Manage peer identities</li>\n<li>Select among potential end-user organizations to perform computations</li>\n<li>Interface with centralized network to perform computation</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Computation-Specific API</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Interface with the centralized distribution network to perform computations</li>\n<li>Allow the end user to provide data to be processed</li>\n<li>Allow the end user to describe the computation to be performed</li>\n<li>Allow the end user to provide the expected result</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Centralized Distributed Network (CDN)</h2>\n<p>The CDN will be the backbone of this project. The mobile application, desktop application, and API will all hook into the network. The CDN handles the production and distribution of both computation and currency.</p>\n<p>The mobile application will interface with a database of peer identities to tie a peer to the mobile application. The peer will then receive its internal CDN address which will be presented to the mobile user to allow them to transfer the currency. Currency will be stored on the CDN and accessed through the mobile application (no currency, for the moment, will be stored on the device)</p>\n<h3>Copyright</h3>\n<p>Copyright 2015 Maxwell Renke</p>\n<p>All rights reserved.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/maxrenke/hackdartmouth2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/maxrenke/hackdartmouth2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Designed ComputeCoin framework, implemented primitive backend server as well as front end interface."]], ["Pathways", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pathways \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/241/378/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We discovered Pathways when we decided to take a stroll through Hanover.

Pathways must be installed on your iOS or Android device before use, as well as having it on your Pebble smartwatch. For instance if you started walking towards your local Starbucks from the Thayer building and stopped by a couple of places for a while, the places you stop at and how long you stay there will increase the popularity of the spot for a certain period of time.

(Search \"Jab\")</p>\n<h2>Our Elevator Pitch</h2>\n<p>Until now, measuring improvement and tracking performance for punch-based athletics were difficult tasks, measured only by the face of your opponents. Now with Jab, an app for the Pebble smartwatch, you can analyze in real time the quality and quantity of your punching game. Through machine learning, Jab identifies when you are making a punch and calculates out a Punch Quality (PQ) value for you.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Rocky II is one of our favorite movies. We wondered what we could do for Mr. Balboa in the 21st century.  </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Jab uses the accelerometer in Pebble to detect jabs, compute the quantity and quality of jabs, and give the user feedback. In the app, there are two modes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <strong>Strength Mode</strong> - Hulk Smash. You can too. Strength Mode will record the Punch Quality, a metric that combines power, rotation and technique. Jab will show you the best punch you've done this workout in addition to your previous and average Punch Quality, so you know just how hard you can hit.</li>\n<li> <strong>Speed Mode</strong> - Speed Mode is built for long sparring sessions, tracking the number of punches you make and the average rate at which you let your fists fly. Ever wanted to know if you're the fast and furious, or the slow and steady? Speed Mode will let you know on the fly during your fight.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Controls</h2>\n<p><strong>Up and down buttons</strong> - Toggle between strength/speed modes.<br/>\n<strong>Center button</strong> - Resets the data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The app initially tried to calculate punch displacement. However this took a double integral, which has insane error propogation and the lack of a gyroscope further complicated the calculation. Even with a Kalman filter the output was too far off. This challenge led us into making a more specialized application based on what we learned, leading towards the application that we have now.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>We did some hard hard math, and the app is responsible, agile, and compact (Pebbles only get 25 kb of user RAM!).<br/>\nAnd we have our first app in the Pebble Appstore, and a working product that we would be happy to use ourselves.</p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\n<p>It ain\u2019t about how hard you hit, it\u2019s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how coding is done.   </p>\n<h2>Future Directions</h2>\n<p>Training sets for punch types, larger RAM / better accelerometer. Only Pebble Time will tell.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://cs.dartmouth.edu/~xan/Jab/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cs.dartmouth.edu/~xan/Jab/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cs.dartmouth.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hongyuchen/jab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hongyuchen/jab\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I coded the jab detection, jab quantification, math utility functions, display, control, ui, and algorithms for Jab.", "I designed and coded the jab quantification algorithms, jab detection, designed the UI, and built the webpage "]]]
