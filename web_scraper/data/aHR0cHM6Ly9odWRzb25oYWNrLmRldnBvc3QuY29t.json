We believe that this is unfair. So, we strive to bridge one of the gap that low income students face: Lack of access to quality information.</p>\n<p>As a student or parent enter our website, he or she can easily sign up, with only name, email address and school name.  Knowing that computers are not easily accessible to the families that are part of these communities, we have made the website mobile compatible as well. The system, based on NYC open data, is able to go in and search and suggest the school name before the user even finished typing its name. Based on NYC open data, it also identifies the location and other relevant information that might be useful toward facilitating the growth of a student from a specific school.</p>\n<p>We provide targeted information to students of specific grade with specific subjects. Students can easily explore and strengthen their knowledge, which is what we dearly refer to as a process of catching up. The name of the website. Ketch-up was a mere wordplay of catch-up, hoping to make kids giggles because we understand the silliness and innocence these children possess. </p>\n<p>Another feature that the websites provide is a list of events that are near the child's school. When an user are tired of studying, they can search for activities that are child-friendly and safe near their school area, where they would know best. In this way, we strive to make school and the area surrounding it a place where the child enjoys and wants to go to. Education, after all, is meaningless if the child does not enjoy it. By providing the child with activities that he/she can do for free with friends near their school, school suddenly becomes much more memorable.</p>\n<p>As a team, we're all learners and understand the joy of learning. With this in mind, we strive to share this with people, especially students who might not have ready access to all the resources out there!</p>\n<p>We'll continue to grow, as a website and a community. Because all these children will constitute to the development of future and we have total faith in them.

Meanwhile, the homeless and other underserved individuals are going hungry every day. According to a study by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, 1 in 6 NYC residents are food insecure. Wasteless aims to change that by providing a simple, streamlined way for homeless people to find surplus food and for generous companies and individuals to help people and reduce waste.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Restaurant managers or people managing events can easily broadcast the fact that they have extra food to give away by entering information about when food will be available and where to get it. A hungry homeless person can text their zipcode to our Twilio number to get a single message broadcasting the time and location of the food giveaways that are most relevant to them. Passerby looking to help a homeless person can check our web app on their smartphone for more detailed information about the food giveaways. This gives passerby a meaningful way to help a homeless person which is worth more than giving a few dollars would be.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We have so many ideas for this service and the biggest challenge was distilling our ideas into a minimum viable product that we could complete in such a short time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of building a user friendly, functional, and secure web app from start to finish. We are also proud of coming up with a product that we feel could really help the city and citizens of New York.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about PHP and also about the Twilio API! This challenge also made us think a lot about the challenges facing the homeless.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Wasteless</h2>\n<p>We plan to make a mobile version of the app so that we can get location data. Although a homeless person might not have a smartphone, someone walking by a homeless person would be able to quickly check the app and let the homeless person know of food giveaways. We also want to give restaurants the ability to log in to the app using Gmail so that they can edit or delete event or create recurring events. Finally, we are considering ways to make sure a particular location is not overwhelmed by a crowd by adding an SMS and mobile app RSVP step to the process.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nfallen/hudsonhack2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nfallen/hudsonhack2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://45.55.220.49/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://45.55.220.49/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>45.55.220.49</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["paypyrus", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"paypyrus \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/276/535/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"paypyrus \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/276/424/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"paypyrus \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/276/425/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"paypyrus \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/276/426/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"paypyrus \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/276/427/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Prompted by the question, \"What do you wish you could do when you see a homeless person on the street?\", paypyrus is designed with the goal of decentralizing social welfare. paypyrus provides a way of letting citizens give money to the homeless with the guarantee that the money will be used for valuable services.
