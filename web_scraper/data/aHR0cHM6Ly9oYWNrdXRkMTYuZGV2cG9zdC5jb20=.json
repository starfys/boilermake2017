Too frequently, I have gone on my weekly grocery runs only to be unsure or even completely forgetful of what I need and coming home only to realize that I wasted money getting a surplus of something I already have or that I need to go back to the store to buy something essential. After being consistently faced with this issue, I came to the indignant epiphany that, especially in the age of ubiquitous technology that we currently live in, there has got to be a more convenient and easier way to circumvent this problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>IoF keeps track of our pantry inventory in real time and connects it to a database in the cloud as to be accessible at anytime, anyplace as long as you have an internet-connectable device with you. IoF's main peripheral function is to scan the barcode of an item that you're taking out of a pantry as a way to measure inventory; we decided to use an iPhone as a convenient analog representation of this camera module. In addition, IoF calculates your consumption differentials in order to accurately assess the optimal time to restock at any given time. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>IoF was built using a combination of different APIs and crowd-sourced to connect to the FireBase Real Time Database. The backend was written using Python, and the web version was generated using Flask Python. The iOS Swift Application was built purely using Swift and Cocoapods.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We learned new technologies, and were a bit confused on where we were headed on this project. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was able to create an API using Python. I wrote a good front end and helped contribute greatly to the back end. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned so much about technology and software development and this does not stop here. </p>\n<h2>What's next for IoFood</h2>\n<p>We are going to take IoFood to the next level because we believe it will help many people. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">osx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/afnetworking\">afnetworking</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoa-touch\">cocoa-touch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">searchupc</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://inoutfood.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://inoutfood.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>inoutfood.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/kevinj97/IoF\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/kevinj97/IoF\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/dingwilson/IoFood\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/dingwilson/IoFood\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Firebase backend in Python, focusing on the algorithmic computation of statistically significant variables.

Unfortunately, Virtual Reality headsets and the powerful gaming rigs required to run them are becoming increasingly expensive. So we devised an alternative solution that is far cheaper, more accessible, and just as fun as enjoying a multiplayer VR experience. </p>\n<p>Venture is terror in a maze. As the VR user, your sole purpose is to make it to the other side in one piece. You will traverse the corridors while dodging monsters and racing time. Meanwhile, as the iOS user, you'll enjoy a laid back perspective in God mode. Here you can see the whole maze from a bird's eye view. Your goal is to help your VR friend finish the maze. To do this you'll need to unleash unspeakable monsters and ghosts into his world to scare him in the right direction! Together you make the perfect team of the age old fieldwork-and-intelligence duo.</p>\n<p>Venture is glued together with a Node.js server that uses socket.io streaming technology to provide the low latency experience modern games demand. Through the Oculus Rift, the Unity game engine relays information of the 3D world through the server and into a projection on the iOS screen. Similarly, the phone user can transmit commands to modify the 3D world the VR user resides in.</p>\n<p>We ran into several difficulties in the process of creating this project. Node.js and socket.io are very new technologies with little documentation. Interfacing Unity with a completely new technology like socket.io created a variety of glitches, inconsistencies, and latency issues throughout our time of developing. We literally used the entire twenty-four hours of HackUTD to overcome these bugs by modifying the source code of different default libraries and implementing creative hacks that ensured consistency throughout our source code. </p>\n<p>This is one of the first times something like this has ever been done, and it was by no means easy. The libraries given to us are extremely basic and required a lot of modification to get them to work with our project. Finishing this project and sticking through with it through all the difficulties is definitely something we're proud of. </p>\n<p>Throughout the process of this project, we learned how to interface the three different devices with low latency all while maintaining AAA graphics</p>\n<p>In the near future, look for us in a more public light. We'd like to deploy our server to cloud services and make our game much more accessible to the world! Along our development cycle we had so many great ideas for additional features such as new ways to change the 3d world, scarier monsters, and maybe even some cleaner code!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/d7laungani/Venture\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/d7laungani/Venture\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["WeabooDatLife", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WeabooDatLife \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/365/941/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WeabooDatLife \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/366/162/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I wanted to talk with my waifu when we weren't together</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Go to the flask web site and enter your phone number, anime, and character you want to talk to.

So, we thought and found out, that the best can be done using Gesture control.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It uses a Leap based application that talks and sends gestures to the android phone over the Wifi, to control the temperature, signalling for elevating and lowering at will.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We primarily used Android and Java.

We ran into an issue with the streamlining of gesture messages from the leap app to the android app. We solved it using the concept Sockets.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We implemented few things like the communication between two remote hardwares using basic socket programming, which is a raw and major achievement, we feel we implemented a miniature IoT.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about an amazing application of software in everyday hardware. We were introduced to a wonderful sensor based technology Leap, which has huge potential.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ges-Stat</h2>\n<p>Ges-Stat can be really big ! We want to take it further, as it can grow and spread as a very intuitive utility to help people in general and also patients, aged persons and the differently abled in accessing the power of these home automations without tiring a muscle.

After registering, patient will be able to use a smartphone to connect using an iOS app. HealthMate will serve as a channel between the patient and doctor to improve the quality of care through effective communication. Patient can remotely apprise the doctor before the next follow up.

Although things might be easy, it doesn't mean they can be done quickly. In the 24 hours we have been participating in this hackathon, we have been able to develop a website that has user logins and can upload guides using django admin panel. You can view guides, you can view buddies, and you can see your buddies guides. Has a restful API</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Study Guides is built using the Django web framework. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was rather difficult defining what exactly we wanted to include. There were so many ways we could have taken this project and we needed to figure out what the best use of our time was. This was not calculated too well as we realized much too late that the mobile app was not really feasible to complete in such a time period. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Made the Logo for the company completely from scratch. Being able to upload a successful website that runs smoothly and captures the gist of what we want our product to do.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>There is an existing framework that made the restful API pretty easy to implement. There are no other sites that allow for collaboration and organize it in the way Study Buddies does. There are no other competitive sites that use confirmed user ratings for each publisher. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Study Buddies</h2>\n<p>A whole lot.

In the website, customer could type in their desired test time and place (with further development of the program). Then these information will be transmit to our database and stored in it until the customer has made the appointment successfully.\nThe main idea of our project is to help new drivers to schedule a driving test as soon as possible, especially when some city (like Bryan of Texas) has too many people want to have a driving test, but only can get an available one more than three months later. However part of the scheduled appointments will be released when some others no longer want them, but no one know that of course no one make use of them. We think that is a waste of government resource, to avoid these things happening, we designed the notification system, which could not only help our customers but also make the government\u2019s driving test more efficient.</p>\n<h1>HackUTD : Find Available Driving Test Appointment</h1>\n<h2>Required Environment</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Firefox Browser</li>\n<li>Ruby on Rails</li>\n<li>Ruby(4.2.2)</li>\n<li>Python</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How to setup the App</h2>\n<h3>downlowad the code</h3>\n<p>Open the terminal:</p>\n<p>Clone the repo: </p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$git clone https://github.com/njuyangyang/sample_app-1.git ~/sample_app\n</code></pre>\n<p>Change directory:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$cd ~/sample_app\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Set the front-end environment</h3>\n<p>Installing Rails with a specific version number:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>gem install rails -v 4.2.2\n</code></pre>\n<p>install the gems using:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$bundle install \u2014-without production\n</code></pre>\n<p>migrate the database:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$ bundle exec rake db:migrate\n</code></pre>\n<p>run the local web server:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$rails s\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"terminal\" data-canonical-url=\"/screenshot/terminal.png\" src=\"/screenshot/terminal.png\"/></p>\n<p>Now the application should be available on the local server:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>http://localhost:3000\n</code></pre>\n<p><img alt=\"UI1\" data-canonical-url=\"/screenshot/UI1.png\" src=\"/screenshot/UI1.png\"/></p>\n<p>Click the button:Get Started Now!</p>\n<p><img alt=\"UI2\" data-canonical-url=\"/screenshot/UI2.png\" src=\"/screenshot/UI2.png\"/></p>\n<p>Enter Your Information:\nYour name, Your email, and the expected date you want to take the driving license test(According to the website of DPS, you can only input the date 90 days from now)\nAnd then click create</p>\n<p><img alt=\"email\" data-canonical-url=\"/screenshot/email.jpg\" src=\"/screenshot/email.jpg\"/></p>\n<h3>Start the back-end</h3>\n<p>Change directory:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$cd ~/sample_app/db\n</code></pre>\n<p>execute the controller.py:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$python controller.py\n</code></pre>\n<p>Top structure of Database</p>\n<p><img alt=\"DateBase\" data-canonical-url=\"/screenshot/databaseschema.png\" src=\"/screenshot/databaseschema.png\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"DB1\" data-canonical-url=\"/screenshot/DB1.png\" src=\"/screenshot/DB1.png\"/></p>\n<p>Availibility Table</p>\n<p><img alt=\"DB2\" data-canonical-url=\"/screenshot/DB2.png\" src=\"/screenshot/DB2.png\"/></p>\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n<p><strong>warnning</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>You will receive a notification only if your expecting date is available.

Also, with increasing gas prices and college cost, students find it harder to maintain their vehicles. So why not find a balance between the two parts of college life.</p>\n<p>There are two types of users: drivers and requestors. Requestors can post their resquest, as in what all they want for groceries and from which store. Drivers can see all the requests made in their vicinity and can accept any request, if the driver plans to go for grocery shopping (Yay!). Once done, the driver can purchase the groceries and send the reciept along with total amount. The requestor has to accept the request, and once done the driver can deliver the groceries to the requestor at the given location. Upon successful delivery, the requestors card will be charged with the total amount, which includes grocery amount, service fees, gas, and tip(optional), and that amount will be added to driver's account/venmo. The requestor gets groceries with delivery service at the cost of minimal charges. On the other hand, the driver earns some money while grocery shopping for themselves, just by picking up a few extra things.</p>\n<p>We used ionic to design the template and the basic app so that it can work on PC, android, as well as iphone (we care for our users). The functionality and further detailing for front end was done by using AngularJS. The backend server is supported by Amazon Web Services.</p>\n<p>Making sure the requests are made in a proper way, the server responds to the correct user, displaying and transition in a logical way, and there is no glitch or scope of cheating the system, were some of our top priorities, on which we spent most of our efforts. Choosing ionic over react was a good decision, even though it came after a few hours. Nevertheless, what's a project without challenges? We still are facing challenges, but with the goal in our mind and laptops in front of us, we will face them with monster energy and free food.</p>\n<p>We learned something new; we worked on what we wanted to; we got free space and food; we got an amazing environment. Isn't that enough</p>\n<p>We learnt using Ionic</p>\n<p>Keep on working on it and get a scalable market for it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mongos</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["TempoTrainer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TempoTrainer \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/366/004/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The recording and feedback interface.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TempoTrainer \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/365/890/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A companion smartwatch app.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TempoTrainer \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/366/029/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The playalong interface.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Playing music is supposed to be fun--let's keep it that way! </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TempoTrainer is a platform for practicing music, refining skills, and learning about your habits.
