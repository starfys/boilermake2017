Many of these refugees have been streaming across the Mediterranean into Southern Europe. There are often people starving to death on the streets, next door to people who are both capable of and willing to help them. The large communication gap between the people who desperately need help and the people who are trying to reach them needs to be bridged - and this is where our technology comes in.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>CentRefuge provides a scalable technical solution to the current refugee crisis. Our medium of choice is SMS messages, largely due to their affordability and reliability. We allow refugees or anyone in need of help to communicate their basic needs to a group of volunteers in the region. By simply texting a hotline number - +1-(256)-515-4199 - they can get help from people within their neighborhood or city within minutes.</p>\n<p>We store and aggregate the data of the volunteers as well as the people in need of help to better understand and visualize the parts of Greece which are suffering the most. By pinpointing these areas, we hope to make it easier for authorities to respond promptly and effectively.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our project is threefold: a SMS system, an Android application, and a web application.</p>\n<p>We used Twilio to forward SMS messages and communicate with a FireBase Database. Then, we used DigitalOcean Droplets (in a distributed manner, with 1 master and 3 slaves) to service to a large number of incoming requests at a time. Our servers ran a NodeJS backend to connect the messages to volunteer data and match people with those most likely and available to help them. We also built an Android app for volunteers to sign up to help people near them. Finally, we built a web app using HTML, CSS, and the Google Maps API to visualize and aggregate the data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating a distributed system in NodeJS was quite difficult - communicating between the master and slaves was quite tricky. Even after we established communication, it was still hard to find a good way to load balance quickly to distribute the load evenly between the slaves.\nIt also wasn't trivial to find volunteers near the requests. We did this by parsing the requests for a zip code - however, a lot of the work translating the zip code into a city and then into latitude/longitude coordinates was done by hand.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We addressed a really important problem and we overcame many technical challenges along the way. We worked together well as a team and parallelized a lot of the work, while still keeping in touch with what everyone was up to, with hourly scrums :) The entire time, we kept correctness and good-design as top priorities.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Hackathons are fun :) </p>\n<h2>What's next for CentRefuge</h2>\n<p>We want to follow through with our project and we want to see our work have an impact in Greece. We also want to further scale our distributed system of servers to be able to handle the kind of volume that Europe is dealing with in terms of the refugee crisis.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/web\">web</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.centrefuge.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.centrefuge.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.centrefuge.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Tanzania Visualized", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tanzania Visualized \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/035/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Health Facilities - how health facilities are spread across the country</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tanzania Visualized \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/036/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Educational Perfomance - regional differences made visual with educational performance organograms</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tanzania Visualized \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/037/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Homepage - the living form of a new brand</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tanzania Visualized \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/038/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>List of visualizations - how we came to organize all the visualizations and project we came to engage with.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Inspired by the impressive impact that social computing can generate with data analysis and information spreading, our project has experienced tons of brainstorms before being consolidated - from the layout and presentation of the visualizations themselves to the creation of a new, original and unique brand for the website.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Tanzania visualized is able to decodify Tanzanian Government's data and create beautiful, intuitive and inspiring visualizations and graphs, in order to allow better information spread, as well as new perspectives on social, economic and political situations around the country.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Based on both d3.js and d3plus, our project uses HTML and CSS to host a java script run visualization.

We strove to make dHOPE as applicable as possible in regions where flooding is a constant and serious threat, such as Tanzania.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>dHOPE engages users by keeping track of their DPP (Drain Protection Points) in order to incentivize community members to take initiative in taking care of their local drains. Because these regions often lack the infrastructure to maintain up to date databases for municipal drainage systems, we used a crowdsourcing solution to identify the drains. In order to engage the community with the idea of protecting their local drains, we designed dHOPE to be a fun, interactive experience. Members of the community are awarded points for identifying, confirming, and adopting drains, and a local leaderboard tracks those who contribute the most to the community. In order to provide additional functionality, we also added additional features of a color-coded system and a weather panel to warn of imminent rainfall.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>dHOPE is built using meteor.js in conjunction with javascript and HTML. We integrated multiple functionalities, including a database used to store user and drain information and a weather panel that uses weather forecasts to warn of forecasted rain. We implemented the Google Maps API in order to provide a visualization of the drainage in a certain area while making use of Google Map's up-to-date location information. We also allowed for users to login with social media accounts, empowering them to share their efforts and raise awareness in their community.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Updating the database proved to be challenging because the updates that we sent to the database would vary widely in response time.

We made an application, which not only uses the original communication method called SPASMS, but also takes it a step further to bring a full digitalization of health in Philippine. Think of an Uber app -- just as Uber connects the customer and driver to communicate directly, our application connects the doctor and patient to communicate at all times so that the patient can always be aware of his/her medical needs if the doctor owns a smartphone. SMS will be sent through our application and we believe that this function would work favorably for the less privileged communities. \n Initially, the client will have to register, where the client will input their phone number, password, and the choice of a patient or a doctor, which will determine which service they receive. After, both the doctor and patient can log in by typing in their phone number and password. One of the key point of this application is it's potential to be distributed and used more widely. We used Amazon Webservice to construct our database system, which is expected to be applied in data mining or big data or many other purposes, depending on how the developer wants to use it. Also, the interface of this application offers a user friendly experience so that any patients or doctors would be fond of using our application.<br/>\nUnforunately, the lack of time has limited us from developing many distinguished features of the two roles, but we have set the foundations for other developers to optimize the doctor's and the patient's experience with the app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/quki/IDHACK2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/quki/IDHACK2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Android Network Communication,", "", "", "", ""]], ["RefugeeAid", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RefugeeAid \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/058/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>the app looks like this ;)</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>RefugeeAidLesbos</h1>\n<h1>Problem Statement</h1>\n<p>Currently in Lesvos, the refugees have no database of information regarding the essentials needed.

However, because they have limited resources and pay per bytes used, it is optimal to reduce file sizes in order to increase accessibility. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our approaches online education in a different way. Rather than use the traditional audio and visual files to create a video (which inevitably takes up a lot of memory) we decided to simplify the \"video\" to exclude everything but the necessary components. In this way, we were able to drastically reduce the size of the \"video\" so that an hour's worth of lesson can now be turned into approximately less than 100 KB. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>In order to simplify the video we decided what parts were necessary for a comprehensive lesson. Rather than have moving images, we decided on one diagram that was divided into parts. In this way, the user could have a greater understanding of the system (in our case mitosis) as a whole while they also focused on specific parts of the diagram (as indicated by audio cues). Furthermore, in order to reduce the size of the audio file we also used a text to speech API. These two factors greatly contributed to the efficiency of the code. In order to allow the student to also replay various parts of the lecture, we broke the \"audio file\" into 5 buttons so that the appropriate parts could be repeated. To support access from mobile websites we formatted the image to fit the size of the screen accordingly.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We were first unsure how to approach the program, because the way the video was run in the original file was in a new type called vvid. The next challenge was figuring out how to simplify a lesson plan so that while all of the necessary information was conveyed the file was stripped of unnecessary usages of data. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the implications of our program. By approaching the problem from a new perspective and providing a completely new form of \"video\" to the website rather than altering the one that we were given we were able to see dramatic improvements. We hope that our project will definitely contribute to the accessibility of online educational websites by minimizing the file sizes. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned more about each other, especially because we spontaneously met each other during the hackathon. Furthermore, we learned more about video compression which all of us had had absolutely no experience in.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Video Compression</h2>\n<p>We hope to be able to expand our mindset on reducing the sizes of other types of files such as learning programs and other tools that can greatly supplement the students' education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Lecture Compression", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Just trying to make the world a better place</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Basically, if fully developed it would make hour long videos be the size of approximately 1 megabyte, which would be pretty pretty awesome in terms of efficiency and for places that have limited internet access</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Brainstorming with comrades, and a whole lot of Java (not really, but maybe in the full implementation)</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Had to learn Java, as well as the Android Development Studio for implementation on android devices.

In fact, many apps and websites already exist to help refugees find things they need. Yet these resources all fail to address  two key problems:</p>\n<p>1) They are not addressing those who need help the most:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> \u201cNot all have access to this technology. It is no surprise that the refugees carrying smartphones are those who could afford them back home\u2026.And even those who have phones don\u2019t always have access to the Internet, or to apps and services that might help them.\u201d -- Wired, The Smart Phone Completely  Changed the Refugee Crisis \n</code></pre>\n<p>2) The organizations do not have a way to receive input from refugees or coordinate their efforts with other groups</p>\n<p>With these problems in mind, we designed a new framework to address these essential problem spaces. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We've created a website where refugees can SMS a phone number asking for help or information. For example, a refugee could ask: \u201cWhat is the weather going to be like for the next week?\u201d or, \u201cWhere can I find water?\u201d. </p>\n<p>Using machine learning, our system will identify keywords and automatically ask clarifying questions. Next, our website would automatically sort and convert these questions to \"tickets\" for organizations to fulfill. Organizations could send a reply like \"We will be sending water to x location in 5 hours\" or \"You can find water at these 4 locations nearby\". </p>\n<p>If there was 50 tickets about water from the Moria refugee camp, that would indicate a large need that might indicate a direct intervention.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Twilio API to send and receive SMS. We also used Indico for text analysis and machine learning.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting multiple API's and other tools to work together was a major challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team, our proudest accomplishments are centered on creative collaboration and making safe spaces for learning.  We hacked, made new friends, stacked cups, and had fun!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our team was comprised of members with diverse backgrounds. We're engineers, biologists, SLAM poets, people who literally learned to code over night, and most importantly people driven to create impact centered change through technology. We each went outside of our comfort zones and learned something completely new (using API's, Photoshop, Python, etc). </p>\n<h2>What's next for CoordinAid</h2>\n<p>In the future, we'd like to enable crowdsourcing through the public domain to better answer and address refugees' questions and needs. We'd also like to further machine learning  so that question filtering could increase efficiency overall (no need to have humans answering every question).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indico</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Skinc/Coordinaid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Skinc/Coordinaid\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://coordinaids.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://coordinaids.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>coordinaids.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I mainly worked on the systems design aspect of this project.
