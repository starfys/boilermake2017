The system still relies on people phoning the oil companies when they run out. Similarly oil companies do not know if other customers in the area need oil and could be included in the same delivery run. Our solution improves logistics for oil companies saving them on man-power, fleet and transport costs, as well as offering their customers a more complete service: it  eliminates the need to make multiple deliveries to same area and notifies the customer when their oil is running low. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We are building a Smart Edge IoT Sensor that monitors oil levels in tanks. The clever device is installed on oil tanks and allows homeowners to better understand and manage their oil usage. It sends alerts when levels are low, places reorders and intelligently recognises fuel leaks and thefts. No more last minute ordering or cold homes while awaiting delivery.\nBy remotely managing and monitoring the level of oil in tanks across the city and country, we are able to oversee the oil needs of multiple houses or communities.\nOil suppliers can then provide their customers with a seamless service by providing a top-up when they hit a minimum threshold and keeping them warm all through the year. Customers can opt to join a community group, making it possible to place bulk orders to an area and bring down the last mile delivery charge. To complement the IoT solution, we have also built an adaptive route planning system to allow oil delivery drivers to find the best delivery route and look for alternate customers nearby, when charted customers are not contactable.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Sensor</strong>: We built an ultrasonic level sensor integrated to an Arduino board. Using sigfox module we were able to communicate the level information to the cloud service. \n<br/><strong>Platform</strong>: We used <strong><em>IBM</em></strong> and <strong><em>Cisco</em></strong> technologies extensively in our project. IBM's Node-Red service was used to consume data from the sensor devices, which were then used to detect conditions to trigger alerts. \nWe used <strong><em>Cisco</em></strong>'s Tropo service to send out alerts/SMS to consumers. We showcased conference calls between customer, delivery personnel and administrator. \nWe used <strong><em>Cisco</em></strong>'s Spark service for Oil supply administrator to send offers, make calls to oil delivery personnel etc. We built a bot that could retrieve level of tanks, routes, weather conditions etc ( Refer attached images) </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cisco\">cisco</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["HIYA", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Social interaction, elderly, home.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for HIYA</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sigfox</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["ibed", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspirati</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>patient bed management</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for ibed</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Strategy ", "I built the hardware to runs ibed.
