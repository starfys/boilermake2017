As part of the energy and environment track, we set out to solve this problem by creating a product that allows users to save money <strong>and</strong> the environment at the same time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Use Watt to save money and lower energy consumption for household appliances. Plug in some numbers, including household and appliance information, and we'll crunch the data. Within seconds, see how much you can save. We'll let you know if you should replace your household appliances, including AC units, heater units, microwaves, dishwashers, and more. Just let us know where you live, how many people live in your house, how long you plan to live there, how big your house is, and the models of each of your appliances.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Rover is built using several energy and environment datasets for cost and usage aggregated for the consumer. We're running on Flask for Python.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Watt</h2>\n<p>The model is basic, meaning that there are several next steps we need to take in our model. Many of the variables and conditions were simplified for the purpose of the hackathon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/web\">web</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/design\">design</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">environment</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">emergent-tech</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nikhilvravi/Watt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nikhilvravi/Watt\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Python backend for the site and aggregating datasets", "", "", "", ""]], ["Eyezheimer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Eyezheimer \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/606/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Taking photos of user's face using face tracking</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Eyezheimer \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/644/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The diagnosis report that will be provided for users</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Eyezheimer \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/900/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The report includes descriptive data</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Eyezheimer \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/748/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>An eye that has been analyzed by our algorithm</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>The Inspiration:</h2>\n<p>The worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) is predicted to be growing to 106.8 million in 2050. Every year, there are over 5 million new cases being discovered. Traditionally, diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s disease requires the use of CT scan. However, this is both inconvenient and expensive. According to New Choice Health, the national average cost of a brain CT scan in the U.S is $1,200, not to mention the third-world countries where it\u2019d be hard for people to even find CT scans. That\u2019s why we came up with Eyezheimer. Research has shown that patients with AD reportedly exhibit hypersensitivity to much diluted tropicamide solution (0.005%). With Eyezheimer, the users/doctors can detect whether they possess Alzheimer\u2019s disease simply with a computer that has a webcam and an eye drop.</p>\n<h2>What it does?</h2>\n<p>Eyezheimer asks users to take pictures of their eyes while they are receiving diluted tropicamide solution (0.005%). Then Eyezheimer will use Microsoft\u2019s Face API, eye tracking library and calculation algorithms to determine the dilution ratio of the user\u2019s pupil over time. The user will need to take at least 5 photos (with 10 minutes gap between each take) to get an accurate diagnosis test. In the end, it will present users with a diagnosis report that has descriptive data.</p>\n<h2>How we built it?</h2>\n<p>One of the crucial part of Eyezheimer is to automate the process of calculating the change in pupil\u2019s size after receiving tropicamide solution. We achieved it by using Microsoft\u2019s Face API to isolate the eyes from the face, then we designed algorithms to calculate the ratio of pupil to the entire eye. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into?</h2>\n<p>Finding a good server to host our webapp was a challenge to us. Since we used multiple languages ranging from javascript to python. We encountered problems where the server we previously had used couldn\u2019t host python 3 files. </p>\n<h2>What we learned?</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Microsoft Face API, also learned how to pull an all nighter.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Eyezheimer?</h2>\n<p>We believe there are huge potential market for Eyezheimer, considering the population of people who gets this disease and the cost related to it. In the future, we aim to improve the speed of our calculating algorithm and the user interface .</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yanbofang/disease_detection\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yanbofang/disease_detection\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Kindling", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kindling \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/531/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Chatting with somebody with a different opinion</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kindling \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/530/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Joining a discussion chat room</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Kindling</h1>\n<p>Alex Dao, Danny Oh, and Kevin He at HackDuke 2016 for the Inequality track</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>One major factor of inequality is that people have a difficult time with understanding other points of view. Usually, you can be exposed to other perspectives by having meaningful discussions with people of different opinions. However, as we consume more news via social media, we tend to only read reactions from people who have similar beliefs (a product of ranking algorithms). </p>\n<p>To solve this problem, Kindling connects users with different opinions on a news event. Kindling is a Chrome extension built using <code>React.js</code> and <code>Node.js</code>, that matches people reading the same news article with each other. For example, say you are reading an article on Donald Trump possibly nominating Mitt Romney as Secretary of State. If you disapproved of this event, you might make a judgement and complain to your friends who likely share the same opinion. With Kindling, you can enter a real-time group chat or 1-on-1 chat with other people reading the same article.</p>\n<p>We hope that Kindling can bring people together from all walks of life. We want to help people understand and appreciate the other side of every issue. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexdao/kindling\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexdao/kindling\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexdao/kindling-backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexdao/kindling-backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Backend in node", "The client in React", ""]], ["Paizza", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Paizza \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/449/044/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>material design so fine</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Education has always been essential for advancement in life, and it has become even more important in recent years. However, scaling education to those who need it is a very difficult problem. Tools such as Piazza allow professors and teaching assistant to more effectively scale courses to ever-growing student bodies.  As undergraduate teaching assistants, we noticed that piazza could be used much more effectively and decided to do something about it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>In order to prevent TA fatigue and encourage the learning process, we designed and implemented a machine-learning backed search engine and duplicate question detector for piazza. We applied the natural language tool kit and scipy to analyze questions and extract content vectors. In our web interface, a user can enter a question and see similar questions from the course\u2019s piazza. The natural language analysis we performed means that these results are much more relevant and helpful than those returned by piazza\u2019s built-in search. This means that students can get answers and learn much more effectively, and TAs can focus on answering new questions. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used scipy and nltk to do the analysis of all questions. The backend is a flask app that communicates with a material design frontend. To train the models, we used a third party api over piazza\u2019s internal REST api and accessed data from courses that we have both taught and been students in. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Piazza has no documented api, but fortunately third party apis exist. Questions that may be poorly worded or difficult for even a human to understand presented other challenges, but we were still able to process them. The greatest challenge however, was actually calculating the similarity scores for questions since none of us had used any of the machine-learning related libraries before yesterday. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we made a usable and effective tool that presents a direct solution to an important problem. Even if a student has trouble stating their question, or perhaps does not fully understand the scope of their problem, our system can suggest potential answers immediately.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>It is very difficult to answer programming questions as a human, and we learned that it is even more difficult to teach a computer to do so. We found that even well established systems have room for improvement, and that we are capable of applying our unique blend of technical skills and educator experience to these making these systems better. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Paizza</h2>\n<p>We focused primarily on the initial user interface and the language processing system. This leaves us with several potential paths for further development. Our code has support for other information sources such as Wikipedia and StackOverflow, which gives students convenient access to even more information. We also plan on building an auto-moderator bot over our language analysis system that can supplement information on questions that have already been asked.  This idea attracted attention from both professors and other teaching assistants, and we plan on continuing development. In just a few days, we were able to make a substantial improvement to the learning process and we do not plan on stopping here. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scipy\">scipy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material-design</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["FOODpedia", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FOODpedia \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/755/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FOODpedia \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/756/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Information Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FOODpedia \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/757/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Links Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FOODpedia \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/758/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FOODpedia \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/797/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Journal Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FOODpedia \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/852/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>30 million people in the United States are diagnosed with an eating disorder at some point of their lives. In addition, so many more people struggle with their body images, their relationships with food, and how to eat properly. These people often lack the means or accessibility to clinical diagnosis and treatment, and oftentimes do not realize they have eating disorders or concerning eating habits that can lead to short and long term negative effects on their health. For these people, getting out of the vicious cycle of an eating disorder is extremely difficult due to lack of professional help, and sometimes no one around them will notice until something drastically terrible happens. </p>\n<p>It's heartbreaking to hear about people who end up hospitalized in life-threatening conditions because they starved themselves. It's heartbreaking to hear about people who have osteoporosis and multitudes of other health problems because they deprived themselves of nutrition. It's heartbreaking to hear about people who look into the mirror every day and think they aren't beautiful enough skinny enough, strong enough, worth enough. </p>\n<p>It's absolutely heartbreaking to realize that there are so many people who have to hurt themselves and make themselves sick thinking about something as important to self-care as eating properly, just because they don't think they are good enough. </p>\n<p>Over the years, we have noticed a pattern in online and mobile apps that help people track their diets to either lose weight, gain weight, eat healthy, and/or maintain weight. Although it is often useful for people with unhealthy relationships with food to track their daily intake of food and exercise to calculate if they're eating well and enough, we believe these existing food tracking apps are way too focused on calories and not on nutrients needed. Thus, people often end up limiting their caloric intake even more, or believe it is okay to eat mostly unhealthy and nutrient-deficient foods as long as the calorie count is low enough. We also believe that the solution to eating healthily and improving people's relationships with food should not be based on a number like calories or weight. What really matters is being able to eat healthily and help bodies metabolize properly without worrying about calories and numbers on a scale. Changing the mentality of people is the most important part of helping people recover from bad eating habits and thoughts. Thus, we were inspired to create a food tracking application that allows people to follow meal plans catered specifically to getting metabolisms back to normal and eating healthily without focusing on numbers. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FOODpedia uses a database of food types to decide different food options in the form of meal plans for users to follow and eat. Users enter in their information (age, height, weight, activity level etc.) and FOODpedia generates eight meal plans that users can follow based on their physical statistics. Each food presented in a meal plan assumes one serving of each food, and no caloric counts are viewable by users. Instead, FOODpedia calculates the amount of calories in each meal plan behind the scenes to make sure that the total caloric count is within the range of a healthy amount of food the user should be eating based on the physical statistics. The meal plan will also be composed of food that covers the necessary amounts of each nutrient the user requires.</p>\n<p>Users can customize their meal plans by filtering out certain foods they have an allergy to and/or dislike eating. Based on the profile information, FOODpedia will decide which nutrients the user needs more, and thus change meal plans to prioritize certain nutrients. </p>\n<p>Another feature FOODpedia uses to help users improve their relationships with food is the journal feature. In this feature, users can input in a food they have eaten, how they felt about eating the food, and additional notes. The emotions over the food are expressed in emoticons users can choose - these emoticons will have no words attached to them, so users can track their feelings on the food based on their own interpretations of the emoticons. Users can also view past entries through the calendar features so they can see patterns in their feelings over food and thus deduce what foods they prefer eating and how they're progressing in terms of their relationship with food. </p>\n<p>Lastly, there is a links page on the webpage that has a list of resources users can access for help through many different organizations that deal with getting help for people who struggle with eating disorders and other related issues. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For backend code, we had a two-step process. Firstly, we took the user profile information to generate hidden values based off of the physical attributes of the user. We stored values of the minimum and maximum calories the user should eat, min/max nutrients, and caps for certain foods and food groups all based off of the information the user provides. </p>\n<p>Secondly, we took information from the Nutritionix API to sort food that matched the min/max values of the nutrients and calories. We then matched the foods together to make multiple meal plan combinations to present to the user. </p>\n<p>For frontend, we designed a logo, a background interface, and handwritten fonts and drawings to make the site more accessible for users. Oftentimes, sites regarding <a href=\"http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eating disorders</a> often use solid blocks of color and standard fonts. However, these designs can feel impersonal and formal, which disconnects users and readers from feeling emotionally connected to the information and advice being provided. Since eating disorders and other unhealthy relationships with food are largely emotional and mentally connected, we think it's important to have handwritten fonts and drawings to make the site seem more human and less robotic. Thus, users can feel more comfortable interacting with the contents of the site. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The communication between backend and frontend code at times were inconsistent and difficult to integrate with each other, which resulted in a lot of interfering code. Part of this was because as individuals, we each had a separate role that we were used to focusing on. However, for most of us this was the first time we worked on a such a large project in such a short span of time, and so we all had to work in roles we were not used to. For example, the backend people had to work on frontend, and the designer had to work on some frontend coding she was not very familiar with. This created difficulties in the communication of the code and being able to integrate code together (sometimes the code just didn't work, or wasn't done in a way that integrated with previous code written by others). </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>However, because everyone was introduced to new roles and assignments we were not used to, we were definitely able to explore a lot of areas we had either never experienced before or had very little interaction with. The fact that we could create this project on a topic we were all passionate about and honestly think, wow, I would actually use this app for myself, is something we're very proud of. We're also proud of the fact that we were able to use such an opportunity to explore areas of coding and design we weren't necessarily comfortable with before. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Coding a cohesive, working project is hard. It's extremely difficult to get everything working and perfect and designed well in such a short span of time. We learned that it's not necessary to have something perfect - the fact that we are genuinely proud of what we've made and genuinely satisfied with the idea and help this application promotes is something that is really important to keep in mind. We also learned that coding projects under a short time limit is fun, despite the lack of sleep and frantic last-minute debugging and troubleshooting. We learned that communication is really important, and that once code starts working, it's extremely satisfying to see all your hard work and effort click together. </p>\n<h2>What's next for FOODpedia</h2>\n<p>We definitely want to add more features and options in the FOODpedia that will make the meal plans more accurate, the information provided more specific, and overall more helpful to users. </p>\n<p>For example, it would be helpful to users to have their meal plans divided by different meals and times of the day. Being able to sort foods by breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks could help users better plan out how they should divide food consumption throughout the day. Additionally, if a user really enjoys eating a certain food or feels more comfortable financially eating more of a certain food (along with other reasons), it would be helpful to implement a feature that can put an emphasize on certain foods appearing in the meal plan choices more often.  </p>\n<p>We also want to provide a feature that allows users to input food they have already eaten so far in the day and returns what food groups and foods they should eat for the rest of the day to ensure that the necessary amount of nutrients and quantity of food will be reached for the day. </p>\n<p>More emoticons can be added to the journal - there is such a wide possible range of emotions people can feel in regards to food. Thus, having a wider range of emoticons an help people express their feelings about eating certain foods more accurately. </p>\n<p>We would like to be able to add metabolism boosting foods in each meal plan to focus on helping people with slower metabolisms due to starvation or irregular eating patterns to boost their metabolisms back to normal so they can get their bodies to function better again. A  problem that arises with many eating disorders is that people tend to starve themselves or have unnatural eating habits that completely slow down their metabolisms. This creates an unhealthy and vicious cycle of eating less and less because people stop losing weight even when they are eating very little. Thus, introducing metabolism boosting foods into diets can also be beneficial in helping people speed up their metabolisms back to normal so they can also eat normally without feeling like they're eating too much. </p>\n<p>We truly believe this application can help many people who need plans to help them eat normally again and understand that eating food healthily and without mental and emotional stress is an important way to take care of themselves.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nutritionix\">nutritionix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">paint-tool-sai</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://food-predictor.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://food-predictor.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>food-predictor.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["move up", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"move up \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/957/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In a speech to the Center for American Progress last month, Obama said: \u201cThe combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream.\u201d </p>\n<p>Many geographic factors influence social mobility: quality of school districts, regional infrastructure, number of single parent households, etc. We were inspired by the Equality of Opportunity Project, which keeps track of mobility in the United States.

We wanted to help curb this issue by creating a product that not only encouraged recycling, but also actively assisted with it. We thus created Smart Recycler as a hardware tool to automate the process of separating recyclables (e.g. cans and bottles) from trash items (e.g. food and wrappers) and allow users to manage their environmental footprint. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Smart Recycler automatically separates recyclables from trash items using computer vision. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>For preprocessing, we scraped web image urls of different types of recyclables and non-recyclables using a Python script in order to acquire a training set for which to test on the Microsoft Computer Vision API. The API returns a set of descriptions which we then used a bag of words model to determine keywords that best describes recyclables. </p>\n<p>When the script for Smart Recycler runs, it uses motion detection to determine that an object was placed. It then queries the Microsoft API and matches keywords to the output of the API to determine the nature of the object. </p>\n<p>For the hardware, we decided that the most reliable and feasible method of separating the two categories of items would be to create a tilting platform. Based on the placed item, the platform would either tilt to the left or to the right, dumping items into a bin for recyclables or for trash. This was accomplished using a high-torque motor attached to a tilt mechanism, and was controlled by an Arduino receiving serial commands from our Python scripts. The actual wooden frame was made using spare wood and screws, and the recycling bins were borrowed from our rooms.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our greatest obstacle was correctly identifying objects using the computer vision API. The Microsoft Computer Vision API is still under development with its features yet to be fully realized, which presented challenges in device accuracy. We thus had to compensate for somewhat frequent misidentifications by modifying the field of view and keyword-matching. Another challenge we ran into was in calibrating our motion detection, as slight vibrations and background noise are to be expected in everyday life. It was difficult to differentiate objects of different material but of the same shape (egs. paper cup vs. styrofoam cup). </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re quite proud that we were successful in actually getting our Python scripts to communicate with the hardware. Based on our testing, the device successfully sorts distinguishable objects such as bottles, food wrappers, and electronics with over 90% accuracy.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to navigate Microsoft Computer Vision API to characterize objects. Using computer vision to differentiate objects can be complicated to implement for non-recyclable objects that are difficult to identify such as paper towels and containers with food/liquids in them.</p>\n<h2>What's next for test</h2>\n<p>This hack has great potential in automating domestic and industrial recycling. Computer vision technologies are still heavily in development and with the continued improvement of available API\u2019s and recognition algorithms, the accuracy and accessibility of computer vision projects will improve.  If this hack were to be revisited, efforts would be made towards providing a user-friendly front end with environment statistics, as well as streamlining the recognition algorithm to sort and update more efficiently. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-computer-vision-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solidworks</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/servo\">servo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hd-webcam</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jerryqypan/Smart-Recycler\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jerryqypan/Smart-Recycler\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on interfacing the webcam and Arduino with Python as well as implementing the motion detection algorithm and computer vision API.

This got us thinking about how we could reduce cyber bullying and that is when we though of Safenger. We realized that if we want to make a significant impact on the online harassment epidemic, then we have to target the source of the issue: social media sites.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Safenger pulls comments and messages that are directed at a specific user on a social media site and analyzes them to see which ones are potentially harassment. Once Safenger has determined which messages are potentially harassment, we send those messages to the iOS app to allow the user to take action in response to those messages. We decided to specifically target Twitter for our hack since they provide a solid API for us to pull direct messages and mentions for a specific user.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Safenger using Swift, Node.js, and the Twitter API. We used Xcode to build the user interface and layout the groundwork for communicating with our backend. Once our backend determines the current Twitter user and has the appropriate permissions, it pulls the direct messages and mentions for that user and sends it to our supervised neural network. After the network analyzes the messages and determines which are potentially harassment, it sends the response back to our microservice which then relays the information to the iOS App. The iOS App then provides the user with an interface to take an action in response to each message.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Facebook API deprecated requests for Facebook messages in version 2.3 of their Graph API. As a result, we had to move on to a different API which we decided should be Twitter. However, we ran into issues authenticating Twitter users because we could not receive an invite to use their Fabric platform before the end of the hackathon (after 15 hours of waiting). As a result, we moved on to the Instagram API but had trouble generating a proper access token that would allow us to access the information we needed for Safenger. At the end of the day, we decided to hard code authentication for Twitter until we get invites to use Fabric.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Supervised Neural Network</li>\n<li>Use of Twitter API</li>\n<li>Stunning UI</li>\n<li>Providing users a way to take action in response to online harassment</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>APIs do not always provide you the data that you need</li>\n<li>There are many ways to harass someone online</li>\n<li>How to successfully work as a team</li>\n<li>How to give a demo on no sleep</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Safenger</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Expand the application to pull messages from more major social media platforms</li>\n<li>Continue training our neural network</li>\n<li>Provide more/better ways for users to respond to harassment</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rishipulluri/Safenger\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rishipulluri/Safenger\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/swarajd/safenger_backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/swarajd/safenger_backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend which used the twitter api and my partner's neural network.", "", "", ""]], ["Schedule Meddler", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedule Meddler \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/521/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>opening</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedule Meddler \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/525/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>team </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedule Meddler \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/640/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>inputing and parsing a file</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Schedule Meddler \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/670/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>google calendar after push</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As a student, we all have those moments where we forgot a quiz, test, assignment. The purpose of our project is to alleviate some of this pressure by preparing for it at the beginning of the semester. By having all of these dates available to you, conveniently placed in Google Calendar, it is easy to remember and set alarms for these events and take away the stress from worrying about missing them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application takes a users pdf and coverts it to a plain text file. This file is parsed into a JSON output, then is parsed again and individually placed into separate events in google calendar. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The user clicks an \"upload\" button, which sends a file to the server using PHP. We then use this filename to execute a jar, also in PHP. This jar will scan the pdf, and export into the text into a plain text file. This plain text file is then parsed for specialized keywords by month, date, quiz, test, and midterm. After this is accomplished, we send a GET request to retrieve all of the dates and event titles from the server. With these titles and date pairs, we loop through them and interface with the Google Calendar API, which posts your events in an organized and completely automated way.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Parsing the pdf was especially difficult, as well as creating all of the corner cases for the syllabuses to parse effectively. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are especially proud of creating a tool that disadvantaged students can utilize to prevent them from using too much energy. We also are proud of creating a tool with AWS, a tool which all of us has never used before.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Collectively we learned a significant amount about using different APIs within Java, connecting the google calendar API, learning new languages, such as PHP, and went through a very rigorous process of learning how to get a domain alive and active. Among all of these and other challenges in the past 24 hours, there have been so many challenges that have pushed us to be better programmers.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Schedule Meddler</h2>\n<p>Our scheduler has limitless possibilities that we can think of adding to it. The next step is to add extension to support for assignments and teacher/TA office hours. From here we wanted to broaden the project and include parts such as a speech to text lecture to manuscript, and this manuscript would also be parsed for key words and phrases, such as \"this will be on the test\", or \"this is very important\". The extensions on this could make this project into an ultimate student hub, directed at making every students life easier and more efficient.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/w3c-css-validator\">w3c-css-validator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/domain\">domain</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://classedout.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://classedout.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>classedout.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://34.192.178.120\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://34.192.178.120\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>34.192.178.120</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I build a parser that reads each line of in the syllabus.

From shadowing physicians and volunteering in the healthcare setting, we know that it can be difficult to remember of all of one\u2019s symptoms since last checkup during a doctor\u2019s visit. Thus, we wanted to create an app that tracks a woman\u2019s symptoms during pregnancy. In this way, both she herself and the physician - if given access - would be given easy access to a health summary of all 9 months of pregnancy, so that irregularities or warning signs for potential issues could be easily detected. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Wee Expectations is a pregnancy tracker for expecting mothers to record their symptoms over the duration of their pregnancy. They are able to receive analytics about the recorded symptoms and are alerted if the reported symptoms are concerning or correlate with possible issues. Additionally, Wee Expectations facilitates the connection of the expecting mother with both the physician, as well as other important individuals, by allowing for the sharing of analytics. </p>\n<h2>What we learned &amp; challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Everything! Jokes aside, there was a lot of Googling involved - from how to use the Facebook login to storing data on Firebase to simple CSS typos, there was a lot of debugging and learning.

Firstly, we will add a Risk Factors page that will include targeted information for the user given her past symptoms, age, weight and other factors. Further, we will add a physician summary page that provides a succinct overview of the woman\u2019s health status and personal information retrieved in part from facebook. This page can then be downloaded as a pdf and printed by the user or accessed by the physician via a separate physician login.

The app takes an argument, $ARGV[0], the number of minutes of recent posts to query from each page.</p>\n<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n<p>In the context of the current media landscape, media literacy has become an invaluable necessity. The goal of this project is to educate social media users by evaluating news articles shared by widely viewed Facebook pages for accuracy, trustworthiness, and bias. We hope to promote greater media literacy among Facebook users in order to improve the spread of verifiable, trusted sources, and encourage readers to consume sources that present diverse viewpoints.</p>\n<h1>Function</h1>\n<p>Our Facebook page does two things. </p>\n<h4>Content Aggregator</h4>\n<p>First of all, it is a content aggregator. It continuously queries major news/media pages on Facebook, and reposts them onto its own page. It queries recent posts in near-real-time, from more than 50 major Facebook news media pages. This allows a diversity of media opinion to be presented equally alongside its peers.</p>\n<h4>Source Evaluations</h4>\n<p>Second, our bot presents a succinct but informative evaluation of each source linked from a major Facebook page. This evaluation informs the reader about the credibility of the source as seen by a diverse sample of respondents surveyed by the Pew Research Center. Additionally, it uses information from the study to acknowledge the existence of partisan differences in the perceived of each source. Lastly, it links readers to the Pew Research Center's 2014 research study on Political Polarization &amp; Media Habits from which we obtained this information.</p>\n<h1>Build Details</h1>\n<p>This script is written in perl, taking advantage of the Facebook::Graph API to interface with Facebook Pages. The API is used to query and retrieve public posts made by major public Facebook pages. Recently created posts that contain links are extracted and compared with our existing database of news source evaluations from the Pew Research Center. These posts are then shared as new posts on the Legitifact public page, along with a brief summary evaluation of the source. By sharing the same post as the original source, we take advantage of Facebook's News Feed algorithm to guarantee that our post containing the evaluation is consolidated together with the original, so that users will be able to view our automated post at the same time as the original.</p>\n<h1>Challenges</h1>\n<p>Because of recent privacy related changes to the Facebook API, it was very difficult to access posts not made by the users. We got around that by posting onto our projects own page, and recognizing that Facebook's News Feed algorithm will automatically collect posts sharing the same link. Since we obtain our links from other Facebook pages, our source evaluations will always appear next to the original poster's page on a user's News Feed.</p>\n<h1>Expanding on the project</h1>\n<p>One of the unfortunate limitations of this project was the lack of peer-reviewed, academic research on the credibility of various internet news sources. In the Information Age, news media giants such as CNN compete with smaller \"viral\" news sources online. The vast majority of our data comes from a research study Pew Research Center carried out in 2014, targeted at news media in general, not on the internet specifically. I believe our application can be improved to be much better targeted at a Facebook news audience with more research data on the media credibility by source in the Information Age. PolitiFact Scorecard tracks the accuracy of a number of statements made by major news sources over a period of time, but we decided it was unsuitable for our project. Because of the nature of the website, Politifact intentionally cherry picks statements, and it does not claim to use peer-reviewed methodology to arrive at the Scorecard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/perl\">perl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/th174/LegitiFact-source-checker-bot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/th174/LegitiFact-source-checker-bot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://facebook.com/legitifact\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://facebook.com/legitifact\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>facebook.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I researched various news outlets extensively by consulting sources such as Gallup, the Pew Research Center, and PolitiFact, and focused on the Pew Research Center's findings in order to build the data collection from which we based our project's core functionality.

Our program takes in a starting location and ending location that someone would either drive or bike, and then will give the user some addresses of places along their route that there have been biking accidents in the past.

I thought it was a decent idea and a pretty manageable task, so I decided to pursue it.</p>\n<p>The web app provides an interactive map to learn more about the environmental initiatives in the past, future, and present to anybody who wants to know about the energy and the environment. There are also resources available for people who want to support the environment through a quick, effective method.</p>\n<p>I used the esri API to build the interactive map, and I also used Sublime to edit HTML from a bootstrap template.</p>\n<p>I didn't know any html, javascript, and css or how to use APIs before coming to HackDuke. I'm just proud that I was able to create a finished project with very little prior experience. Using the API was a little difficult for me because I didn't understand a lot of the underlying code in the beginning, so that took an excessive amount of time. There was a lot of experimentation and googling when I was trying to edit the API to make my interactive map.</p>\n<p>Looking back, I realized I covered a lot. Having rarely used any web development languages and minimal GitHub experience, basically everything I did was a new venture. I learned that Sublime is pretty cool and some of the basics of HTML, like adding hyperlinks, images, text, and formatting (just to name a few things). Getting better with GitHub was also a great experience. Being a CS major trying to learn code, GitHub is literally everywhere and it can be overwhelming trying to navigate the internet when everyone is using GitHub jargon like push, commit, pull, etc. Coming to HackDuke help alleviate the cloud of mystery surrounding all these verbs.</p>\n<p>So what's next? I'm not really sure. I'll probably just continue editing the web app and updating the environmental initiatives. It's a good way to keep learning html and javascript too. Duke Climate Coalition also needs a website so maybe this is a good start, who knows?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">energy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">environment</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/esimran/HackDuke-Energy-Simran\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/esimran/HackDuke-Energy-Simran\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Triangle Public Data", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Triangle Public Data \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/962/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A Screenshot of Durham Larceny Case Data</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to help the local community in the most efficient way possible by analyzing trends and patterns with reference to crime data and important community data in order to develop a screenshot of the Durham area. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using ArcGIS technology on the ESRI platform, we were able to create a tool that can visualize the intersectionality of multiple data points over a geographical region.</p>\n<p>With the analysis of local crime, education, and city data we were able to extrapolate and optimize key locations around the Triangle such as Police Stations, Churches, and Fire Stations using this intuitive and powerful tool.</p>\n<p>We decided to portray these data through these graphs not to suggest definitive solutions to the issue of resource misallocation within Durham county, but rather to demonstrate the reality that even the most basic of public services and resources inherently show bias towards different communities, thereby suggesting that more concrete answers must be developed in the future to address the issues of social inequality.</p>\n<h2>How to Use</h2>\n<p>To use the web application, download the folder as a zip file from google drive, extract and run MainPage.html in Chrome. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed multiple sets of data after which we ran coordinates for crimes, buildings, and other data points through the esri platform to develop interactive map platforms through which the user can explore the various elements of intersectionality with reference to the Durham area. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One issue we ran into was the parsing of data into a usable form, particularly as we attempted to expand the range of our website to the Chapel Hill and Raleigh Areas. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>One particular accomplishment of which we are proud is the learning and utilization of the esri API with dynamic data points to demonstrate the background of intersectionality of social elements. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Throughout the process, we learned primarily how to utilize the esri API platform, css implementation of HTML and Javascript, and the parsing of large databases utilizing python.

According to the One World Literacy Foundation, two-thirds of the students who cannot read proficiently by the end of fourth grade will end up in jail or on welfare <a href=\"http://www.oneworldliteracyfoundation.org/index.php/why-support-owl/iliteracy-statisctics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">(source)</a>. </p>\n<p>In a further conversation with Dr. David M. Malone, Professor of the Practice of Education, we began to consider the significant impact that parents - and their busy schedules - have on young students\u2019 study habits. It can be even more difficult for immigrant parents to overcome the language barrier they encounter in public schools. In the Durham Public Schools district alone, there are 4,619 English Language Learning students who could benefit from a hack that connects these students to older mentors who can help them overcome this language barrier <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ql-R9VJQNyyFS6bCMPkgTjWkvaCDDXwhdm4DixgIg34/edit#gid=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">(source)</a>. With these critical factors in mind, we created PairUp.</p>\n<p>Research has shown that the presence of mentors in a child\u2019s life is associated with improved academic outcomes. This is especially so for people of minority populations. PairUp was created with the hope that children for whom English is not the primary language spoken at home may be put into contact with a mentor who can act as a cultural liaison between the child\u2019s home and external community <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X02004986\" rel=\"nofollow\">(source)</a>.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PairUp is an application for iOS that matches high school students seeking service hours with the parents of elementary school students who are interested in finding an older student in the local community to act as a mentor for their child. The program begins with approval from the elementary school, which provides access codes to both parents and tutors. This approval step ensures that all users of the app are credible and authorized and also allows high school students to receive community service credits for their volunteer hours.</p>\n<p>Once students log in with their access code, they can build their profile with a photograph, biography, and details of their gender, age, school, language, availability, and professional references.</p>\n<p>When parents log in, they are able to view a list of all students or set filter parameters to find more specific matches. If a parent is interested in a tutor, the parents can choose \u201cAccept,\u201d and his or her phone number will be sent to the high school mentor for further communication.\nTutors can log in to view notifications about parent phone numbers or update their profile. They are then responsible for initiating contact with the parent.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The PairUp app was built in Xcode using the Swift programming language. We started by sketching the designs and components of each screen a user would encounter in the app, and then adding details such as new search filters and other functionalities. We also used transitions through the navigation controller.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>While the app can quickly and effectively match parents with passionate high school mentors, there is always the risk of fraudulent or dangerous behavior by people who abuse PairUp. In order to eliminate the possibility of this behavior by mentors, we decided not to allow direct messaging through the app. This way, parents will have direct contact to the mentor by phone, and they can communicate without needing to rely on another messaging system to work. This method also ensures that students will not be flaky in attending their mentoring sessions.\nThe school code requirement is the another layer of security to make the app safer for users.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we\u2019re proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re proud that PairUp is able to target one of the fundamental causes of inequality in education - the language barrier - in a simple way. We found a method to help people access and take advantage of the community networks around them. It\u2019s also significant that PairUp reaches education outside of the classroom and serves as a tool for supporting education. It is not always sustainable to attack education policy problems from the top-down, and PairUp starts at the root and works its way up from there.</p>\n<p>Though we didn\u2019t try to fix the school system, we did find a way to incorporate existing public schools into the use of the app by thinking through avenues for public policy collaborations. In the end, we created a simple, safe product that addresses issues of inequality in education for young students at the time when they need it most.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PairUp</h2>\n<p>In terms of development, we hope to add support for more languages so that PairUp can reach more people in need, as the number of immigrants and refugees in the United States continues to grow.\nWe\u2019d also like to implement a system of check-ins to see if and when matched students complete a mentoring session. Though PairUp can currently help parents find mentors for their children, we do not yet have a way to see if any mentoring occurs after the student receives the parent\u2019s phone number. A check-in system would provide data about the number of successful meetings and the frequency of these meetings, as studies have shown that consistent mentoring is necessary for effective improvement in an elementary school student\u2019s learning <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X02004986\" rel=\"nofollow\">(source)</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the PairUp team would seek school district approval of the app for use among students and parents. Durham Public Schools would be the place to start. Ultimately, the success of the PairUp app will depend on teamwork from the entire community, and we look forward to tackling more issues of inequality and education policy in the future.\nOur hope is that PairUp can initiate a new conversation and collaboration between public school systems and nonprofit organizations to improve the resources available to students of all needs, languages, and origins.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">figma</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joymkim/PairUp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joymkim/PairUp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["FitConnect", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were mainly inspired by our passion of staying fit.

People all around found themselves scrambling for their voices to be heard. </p>\n<p>As new voters, we had the opportunity to exercise our voices in American democracy for the first time in the 2016 Presidential election.  However, we now need a way to initiate change beyond the ballot box.  Many citizens don't even know who represents them, so it is clearly difficult to voice ideas and contact members of government. In a recent poll, 77% of millenials could not even name one senator from his or her home state (<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/poll-millennials-state-senators-114867\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.politico.com/story/2015/02/poll-millennials-state-senators-114867</a>).</p>\n<p>We wanted to streamline and make accessible the process of forming these relationships between constituents and Congresspersons, as we believed that this would be by far the best way to create real change through our cherished democratic process.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By just entering your zip code, something that most everyone knows, users can not only find out who their Congressional representatives are, but contact them directly through email. Upon clicking the \"send mail\" link next to their Congressperson's name, the user's computer's email app opens with a pre-made e-mail template that formats the email but allows for personalization, making voicing concerns easy.</p>\n<p>In addition, with the use of a RSS feed from The New York Times, we bring current important geopolitical issues to the minds of voters, increasing awareness and saliency. This enables users to have the appropriate background knowledge in order to be informed when addressing issues. This not only allows people to educate themselves, but also turn that education into political action.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop the website. </p>\n<p>We discovered an API that would return a list of information about Congresspeople organized by zip code and used this API as the backbone of our project. With handlebars.js, we were able to use this API in JavaScript to output unique HTML code on our website based on the zip code input.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we used handlebars.js to construct an email template that would open when the user selects the link \"Send Mail\".</p>\n<p>We further implemented an RSS feed into our html for a feed of important news.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The toughest challenges was outputting the right Congressperson and e-mail according to the inputted zip code. As first-time hackers, this was a very new experience but we definitely learned a lot, exploring the functionality of JavaScript. We discovered a method to update the URL based on the zip code input, allowing the JavaScript program to access this zip code and return the Congressperson name and contact information.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were proud of the design of the website itself. By implementing Google Fonts, using aesthetic images, and playing around with padding and position, we made something that looks great. </p>\n<p>In addition, taking and sorting the data from the API was a task that we were glad we could take on and accomplish.</p>\n<p>Overall, the entire project was an accomplishment to be proud of -- our first hack, and something that truly has the potential to impact thousands of people. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We each gained working proficiency in a variety of languages, from HTML to CSS to JavaScript. Coding became more natural to us.</p>\n<p>In addition to the technical knowledge acquired, we learned about teamwork and collaboration through coding. The delegation and organization of tasks really was beautiful when everything came together.</p>\n<h2>What's next for RepLink</h2>\n<p>We want to implement RepLink across communities we are involved in. After this, we could expand the database so that we can inform people of not just their Congresspeople, but also of their Senators, State Assembly members, City Council members, etc. We truly believe in the power of each person's individual voice, and with RepLink, we can progress to a more diverse and open-minded society where many views can be expressed and represented.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/handlebars-js\">handlebars.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/martinmuenster/RepLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/martinmuenster/RepLink\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Front-End, making the design with HTML, CSS while also making the e-mail template.", "I worked on the JavaScript code and the integration of the program into HTML.", ""]], ["remoteEdu", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"remoteEdu \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/834/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>commands</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"remoteEdu \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/858/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>commands</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our team primarily consists of students who are employed as Teaching Assistants in the Computer Sience program the Virginia Tech. We noticed a problem regarding students not understanding the material in class and being afraid to speak up. Most tools that are online don't allow students to give their feedback to a certain lectures without having to purchase extra devices to communicate in class  (e.x. iclickers). Our goal was to create a software that centralizes different elements that a professor needs to succcesfully teach their courses. We decided to do that because we want people to speak up and communicate with their professor. We wanted to make remote education easier for people that are struggling in class that would like to get extra help, afraid to speak up.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Web</strong> \n   The web user Interface allows the professors or teaching assistants to make different quizzes or polls to get the students responses and see if the students understand the materials. This process allows the instructors to see the students response to their lecture and solidify the foundations. Professors are also ablt o geet an analytics of the information, so that they may then adjust their course structure to best accomodate students.</p>\n<p><strong>Slack</strong>\n   We use the slack app to collaborate with students, teachers, and helping TAs hold office hours remotely with a quick response to the students questions.In the slack the students can ask questions, attach files and send it to the TA's. The students can view the the different office hours held by the TA's, and be added to the queue to talk to them. This allows for students be able to wait for their turn without hving to physically be in the space and assists the TA in understanding how many students need help</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Node.js and MongoDB to set up the different responses for the students and store them in our data set. The frontend has been built in HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery and Sass. Slack is used as the primary mode of communication.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Working with MongoDB and making sure that we receive different responses from the users and updating the slack properly to make sure people are placed in the queue properly. Receiving the quizzed and the polls from the GUI and making sure they are registered in the data sets properly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of learning Node.js and overcoming our challenges. We were able to get most of our set milestones to make our Centralize Remote Education alive and allow people to communicate using slack for education.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Learned that to prioritize features that make your application unique.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Remote edu</h2>\n<p>Implement Log files and improve the anonymous to mute the users with foul language</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">scass</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://unified-class.herokuapp.com/view/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://unified-class.herokuapp.com/view/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>unified-class.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front-end and design; I made the web application, implementing client-side database communications.", "", "", "", ""]], ["ulysses-js", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We heard a talk by Prof. Dan Ariely describing the idea of using self-binding contracts to create positive behavioural change.

It is all too easy to unintentionally take sides and hurl harmful, unproductive comments at those you disagree with without taking the time to think about all sides of an issue. Moreover, we wanted to help users be actively conscious of whether they were engaging in inappropriate \"locker room banter\" to inhibit targeting of marginalized groups. We aim to provide a tool that facilitates safe and respectful discussion of these issues, as well as educate all parties involved on the content of these issues. </p>\n<p>PCBot is a Slack bot that can be added to any Slack channel. It moderates the discussion of the channel by detecting if participants are making offensive/targeted comments towards minorities. Users will receive either private or public warnings if they post something that is deemed offensive, and the bot will also issue channel-wide warnings if there are multiple instances of inflammatory content. Moreover, in the event that a warning is issued, if the discussion centers around a currently trending political topic, the bot will post resources to educate all users on the content of the topic, encouraging each user to construct rational, factual arguments. </p>\n<p>Tools we used: Microsoft Azure, NLP, key phrase detection, sentiment analysis, topic detection, basic feature engineering and machine learning, web scraping and HTML parsing. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/slack\">slack</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sentiment-analysis</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ml</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jerryjliu/inequality_slackbot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jerryjliu/inequality_slackbot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Helped set up bot and virtualenv connection, added Cleverbot integration, recommended direct-message functionality and trend alert, and provided testing phrases.", "", ""]], ["InvestiChat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Based on current events and the increasing education disparity, many presumptions have been made about those who are not eloquently versed\u2013assumptions about their character, morality, race, religion, ethnicity, etc. We wanted to create something that could bring attention to this through a murder mystery game.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Through an interactive Facebook chat bot, users are able to solve a murder mystery by conversing with suspects.

Nov.18th, 2016, right before HackDuke 2016 started, some annoying smoke smell resulting from wildfires in NC forest enveloped Duke campus. However, it was especially upset when people wanted to know the real time air quality and to do something about it but found no convenient access to the information they needed. \nAir quality has always been the focus of public health issues, because it has an impact on us all. In addition to offering users a more direct and convenient way to monitor the real time air quality on their phones, we feel thrilled at the idea of providing a pathway for citizens to actually participate in environmental improvement, to reach out to those who will be able to make a change, and to contribute to the place they live in.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>AirMap is an android application composed of three parts: a map of average ozone values measured across the U.S. during 2016, a graphical representation of the Air Quality Index in the last 10 years in a user-specified ZIP code, and a resource page which finds the contact information of local representatives in that ZIP code. These parts allow users to find out more about air quality locally and nationally, and use this information to engage with representatives in order to create change.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Android Studio and programmed in java. The mapping portion is supported by Esri\u2019s ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Android, using data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The figure-finder portion was supported by the whoismyrepresentative.com API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the greatest problems we ran into was finding the data we needed. Since air quality changes through time, and it is imperative for people to know the current state, we wanted to be able to access real-time data regarding measures of air quality. We ended up being unable to find a database that becomes updated continually, so we had to manually download and upload the data we used.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re proud that we created this app! None of us had prior experience with Android development, and we are really happy that we were able to make a user-friendly and engaging app despite having to learn everything on the spot.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>While working at your first hackathon, the learning curve can be very steep. We realized this as we tried to create our first app as a team of all new-hackers. However by the next day, we realised that even without much experience you can build something that you are proud of and that someone else can benefit from if you work hard enough. As long as you have an interesting idea, you can achieve some implementation of it. </p>\n<h2>What's next for AirMap</h2>\n<p>We would like to include more air quality indicators in the mapping aspect, as well as work with the EPA to make their data more easily accessible by using a database. Realize the function of directly sending an email to a senator from the app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/huijiayu/AirMaps\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/huijiayu/AirMaps\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Famulus", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To eliminate kids from searching the web for good educational content, allowing them to vote and submit what they and their peers think are good educational material.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The idea behind this web application is to provide a community governed, kid friendly corner, which allows user to submit high rated educational videos and games the public community can add build together using the blockchain.</p>\n<p>The site uses ethereum's blockchain to store website information, and allows the community to add or remove content based on a general consensus vote.

Although the technology is still very immature, I became fascinated by the idea of visible light communication, and how it could eventually be a supplement to help power our growing IoT networks in our offices and homes.</p>\n<p>Although I did not have access to his setup, I wanted to see what kind of low-cost prototype I could put together. I had originally purchased the lamp and materials from Ikea, as well as some microcontrollers and power supplies ordered online.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using an encoding technique called Manchester encoding, my lamp is able to output character data at a speed of around 40 kilobits per second. Users can enter whatever data that they want from one terminal, and another user can see the data being transfered from another terminal. Note that because the lights flicker so fast, the human eye cannot actually see the light bulbs flickering.</p>\n<p>Visible light communication has several advantages over WiFi. Since the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than Radio Frequency, bandwidth exhaustion is not a problem. In addition, since you always need to maintain direct line of sight, it serves as a formidable deterrent to eavesdropping. Finally, there is potential to utilizing Li-Fi in order to offload traffic on conventional Wi-Fi networks at peak hours.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using an arduino, and latter a TIVA C microcontroller, I was able to drive a power MOSFET in order to rapidly switch the light on and off. By encoding the incoming data as a series of switches, I am able to interpret my modulated light patterns with a photodiode that is connected to another microcontroller. The Lamp is from IKEA, and the power junction was purchased from Homedepot. Basic knowledge of circuitry was required in order to properly power the lamp.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Almost immediately I was set back after one of my MOSFETs, along with one of my microcontrollers blew out. I ended up having to create an entirely new board using a breadboard.

After looking more into food waste across the globe, we've decided to combat the growing issue.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Smart Orders looks to optimize food bought by event planners by using an algorithm that calculates the perfect order for the attendees, event planners, and the environment. We have created a survey to best identify event attendees\u2019 needs that only needs to be completed once, ever. This allows us to maximize their satisfaction by tailoring their preferences to the order. Also, event planners are able to save money due to knowing exact needs and not overspending. Lastly and most important, the environment is improved through reduced food waste. In conjunction with our mission, we are donating 5% of our profits to food waste programs (like Food Forward, Food Waste Alliance, and End Hunger) that the users choose between.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The bulk of our project is rooted in our order creator algorithm. We started by doing market research on the things that people tend to have the strongest opinions in. We then considered the ways in which this information could be processed in order to give meaningful results. The way that we built it, user preferences can be saved under their usernames and every event planner company can use our plug in to get the information on people\u2019s food preferences. When the users agree to give the company this information (through a button) we will ask the user if they want to update their preferences. Event planners can create new events through us and we will have a database with all the users that signed up through their event creator. At any point in time the user can view the information and metrics and produce a quote.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>When implementing our idea we talked at a high level with a mentor and did not think about the choices of the services we were using. We built the front end using Wix to make sure we had a very visual and easy to use website by the time of submission. However, this did have some drawbacks since it made it harder for us to control the functionality of the website and limited the flexibility of features. We also built the backend using Java and then realised that the better choice would have been Python in order to make it easier to hook up the front and back end using servers. We sent a long time trying to work around what we had already built to hook up the front and back end but our lack of knowledge of serves unfortunately did not allow us to hook up the system in time. We do have a roadmap of how we would do this: re build the website using HTML/CSS and add functionality to it using JavaScript and then write the backend in Python, which would enable us to use the fact that it\u2019s an scripting language to easily hook it up. We are firm believers that this could be accomplished with a little bit more time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the ability of our website to maximize solutions to multiple problems with minimum complexity.  Whether it be event planners\u2019 tight budgets, attendees\u2019 pickiness, or the well-being of the planet, our product is unique because it targets multiple different needs and elegantly addresses them with a solution that requires very little effort from the users.  Additionally, we are proud of the flexibility of our product design.  With the ability to save food waste and recommend preferred food for situations outside of event planning, such as group dinner outings or local restaurant exploration, Smart Orders\u2019 versatility </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned in the challenges section this experience was very useful for us to learn how to put together different pieces. We have all taken several Compsci classes at Duke and none of them have taught us full integration of something. Thanks to several mentors who we talked to we got a better idea of how we can hook up different aspects of the projects and what needs to be deployed were. We got to learn how to use embedded HTML and JavaScript on websites and learned a lot about the limitations of using Wix.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Smart Orders</h2>\n<p>As Smart Orders gains users, it will build its database based on their preferences.  Then, we can use machine learning to more accurately make predictions about the type of food that an event should cater, given information such as the location, number of attendees, feedback from past events planned, and other data (gender, age).  This way, our algorithm will become more and more accurate, attracting more and more users.  Additionally, Smart Order can be adapted to functionality beyond simply event catering.  For example, groups of registered users can use Smart Orders to find a restaurant that fits their dietary and budget preferences.  More long term, we can add event planning functionality, so we can not only recommend food but also facilitate invitations, effectively becoming the next EventBrite.</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZaldyDuke/hackduke\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ZaldyDuke/hackduke\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lm2604.wixsite.com/smartorders\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lm2604.wixsite.com/smartorders\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>lm2604.wixsite.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Carpool Finder", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Carpool Finder \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/500/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Chrome Extension Icon</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Carpool Finder \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/581/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Example Facebook Group</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Carpool Finder \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/593/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Extracted Facebook Posts</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Carpool Finder \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/546/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Annotating Locations</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I often rely on Facebook carpool to get rides home during University breaks. Carpooling is great because it cuts down on emissions from transportation, but finding a ride through Facebook wasn't always easy. The ambiguous text-based format of Facebook groups meant that you might not be able to find the ride you need just through the search bar. I spent a lot of time just scrolling through my local University's carpool group to see if someone had posted the ride I listed.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>I built an API to analyze posts for any public Facebook carpool group.\nPosts are first filtered for spam, then classified into driver or rider and one-way or round-trip. \nNext, the coordinates and times noted in the post are extracted.</p>\n<p>EX.\nPost: \n\"Looking for a ride to va beach tuesday morning. Checking for the off chance that anyone is leaving for Virginia Beach early-ish tuesday morning, but my plans are still tentative.  Will pay for gas if I come!\"</p>\n<p>Driver: no\nRoutes: ['start': {u'lat': 36.8529263, u'lng': -75.97798499999999}, 'end': {u'lat': 38.0335529, u'lng': -78.5079772}]\nDates: ['11-22-2016']</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used a Facebook scraper to collect posts from carpool groups, then annotated a small set of posts (~300), classifying them and also tagging locations that appeared. The classifiers were trained using the sklearn library tf-idf to construct the feature set, and then exported to pickle. I trained StanfordNLP's named entity recognizer CRF model using my tagged data, and it performed around 90% accuracy. I obtained coordinates for the locations using Google's places API. To extract the dates, I used a modified python wrapper of StanfordNLP's SUTime, a temporal extractor that works by using regular expressions.\nI ported these methods into a Django app to be run as a Rest API.\nLastly, I worked on using the API to create a website to display the routes on a map and calendar, that could be hovered over to display the original Facebook post.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It was challenging to get all the natural language processing and machine learning libraries to work together. The stanfordNLP library was originally in java, so I used a python wrapper involving jar files to port it to python. I ultimately decided to build a rest API to modularize the Facebook post retrieval and processing of coordinates and times.  This means other teams could reuse this API for Chrome extensions or other projects.\nConverting the colloquial names of places into coordinates was also tricky! I used Google's places API to make queries given the colloquial name and the home location (of the FB group) context.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm really proud of how hard I worked on this project.  I felt really motivated with the theme of HackDuke being Code for Good! I didn't have time to do a Chrome extension as I had planned, but I am happy with the results.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to adapt to changes in schedule. I also learned a lot about current natural language processing techniques and how to train classifiers and models.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Carpool Finder</h2>\n<p>Next is the Chrome extension!!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sklearn</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lli5ba/carpool-finder\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lli5ba/carpool-finder\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["BigBrother", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BigBrother \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/452/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BigBrother \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/451/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BigBrother \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/453/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Dashboard asking to confirm profane posts</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BigBrother \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/449/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Email notification</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BigBrother \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/454/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Click on the post to view on timeline</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BigBrother \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/450/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>My cool chrome extension</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BigBrother \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/455/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Image and text hidden because of chrome extension</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Online harassment is a term for harassment over the internet. It can have real life consequences from trauma, depression and on extreme cases even death. Learn more about it here. According to the, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), around 4400 people commit suicide every-year due to cyber bullying (online harassment).\nReference: <a href=\"https://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/</a></p>\n<p>Online harassment has been growing and as facebook has the biggest network of social communication, we believed the first step in this big movement would be to stop it here. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It goes through your news feed on timely manner and figures out cases of online harassment. Our application looks at images as well as texts and filters out profane content.  It notifies you via email right then so that you can take immediate action. For each post, there is a 'bad' score associated for the person who is harassing. Once the user confirms, they are being harassed, the score of the person harassing increases. Once the score reaches a threshold, we block the user from using facebook. </p>\n<p>Our app also has a chrome extension, that can be used to protect the viewer from viewing any profane content on Facebook. Facebook is widely used amongst all age groups, including children. Hence we feel that protecting them from any profane content is of utmost importance. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used facebook API for users to login and give permissions to view their timeline content. We used facebook graph api to get all the information, including images, text content, user details. </p>\n<p>We send the images and text to microsoft azure api \"Content Moderator\". Content moderator flags the texts, images and looks for words and that might be offensive. It also looks at an image and filters out images that are not appropriate.</p>\n<p>We get back the data and send a notification to the user via nodemailer asking them to take an action against a detected harassment. </p>\n<p>We also save the post id onto the database which is used by our chrome extension to hide those contents from being viewed/rendered.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Coming up with an idea to curb online harassment which is one of the biggest issues in the world.</p>\n<p>As usual javascript asynchronous calls and debugging where the issue was.</p>\n<p>We had a diverse set of people working together from different colleges and groups, but we would say it was a fun collaboration and something we all enjoyed.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating a product, we think will go long way and can be used to decrease online harassment to a great great extent.</p>\n<p>Being able to collaborate work in such less time.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Even if the idea is tough, its not true that its not possible. And even if the idea is simple, its not true that we don't face challenges. We learned how to work collaboratively, helping each other as well as working on our portion of the hack. We also learned that we have the power of making a change, all that is required is a little motivation and of course an environment like hack duke :P :D.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BigBrother</h2>\n<p>There is a lot of scope for BigBrother. First thing is BigBrother is still learning and with time we expect it to detect lesser false positives. Another thing BigBrother ultimately looks forward to doing is curb harassment of many other online platforms like twitter.

Statistics show <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/monitor/2014/09/cover-pressure.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">one third of college students feel depressed</a>. So we thought the health and wellness theme of <strong>Hackduke's Do Good Challenge</strong>, provided a great opportunity to pursue this idea.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>TriggerNow</em> uses Speech Recognition and Semantic Analysis to determine a person's state of mind from the words that they use. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used react native to make the app itself. To perform the semantic analysis we used an open source classification data set of over 20,000 words ranked with positive and negative values to give a sentiment score for each phrase the app picked up. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Too many dependency configuration issues to count, especially with Python. Android development in general is very difficult to setup, even without having to use Android Studio.</p>\n<p>We also originally planned to use a heartbeat sensor, but we realized that the pebbles didn't have a heartbeat monitor, so we have to adjust our plans. </p>\n<p>We considered using a muse headband but that was simply too much temerity data and we decided we wouldn't' have enough training data to get reliable results. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We never used <strong>react-native</strong> before, and this is our first ever <strong>NLP</strong>-based hack!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Basics of <strong>NLP</strong> and <strong>neural net</strong> algorithms as well as react native and android dev. A very educational 24 hours!</p>\n<h2>What's next for TriggerNow</h2>\n<p>Future steps will include refining the NLP algorithm as well as adding more parameters to our consideration to give more nuanced diagnoses of a person's mental state. We think by including analysis of heartbeat and examining more precise speaking patterns such as inflection, frequency, and what sequences of words someone utters we can gain a more subtle understanding of his or her mood. </p>\n<p>Moreover by tracking someone's location we can determine locales that might cause someone to feel anxious and inform them and try to put them at ease with a either recommendation or a distraction. </p>\n<p>We plan to eventually build out a decision engine that will evaluate and weigh these factors across time frames to create a mental health profile which users can track and look back to see the progress they've made. </p>\n<p>More importantly we want to provide more interactive feedback for users so as to resemble a kind of personal diary. Since many people who suffer from some form of mental illness or are just going through a tough time keep a diary as a means of expressing their struggles and finding relief. Saying something out loud can provide an even greater sense of relief because it gives the speaker a feeling of permanence. Thus we want to respond back to someone's statement with something that might cheer them up or distract them like an image of their cat or an event they can look forward to, or a quote with which they can find solace. Ideally we'd like to capture the intoxicating feeling of playing an old school text adventure where it seems like someone hard coded almost every possible combination. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Andrewjeska/TriggerNow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Andrewjeska/TriggerNow\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["The NLP algorithm and the dictionary of terms", "Developed Mobile App and Flask API Endpoint"]], ["Duke MyChart: Simplified Radiology Reports", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Duke MyChart: Simplified Radiology Reports \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/753/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Annotated Screenshot of Front End</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Duke MyChart: Simplified Radiology Reports \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/754/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Screenshot of Front End of My Chart</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Duke MyChart: Simplified Radiology Reports \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/785/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Database for Medical Terminology and Simpler Explanations</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it is about</h2>\n<p>The medical reports often contain a lot of medical jargon commonly not understood by patients.

Within challenges, six different energy challenges are available for selection, each with a brief blurb describing these challenges. One can view current challenges and daily tips or past completed challenges, as well as select a new challenge. We plan to implement a notification system each morning with that days tip. Additionally, our team is midway through implementing a \"Favorites,\" which involves the use of a star-shaped button on the daily tip, if the user particularly enjoys one tip, and wants to make it a permanent habit.</p>\n<p>Favorites is a part of the \"Profile\" grouping. Here, the user can view their favorite tips, organized by challenge theme. They can also see a summary of their tip success rate in History at the end of each week, promoting accountability. Finally, About Me will incorporate user behavior and location to tailor tips.</p>\n<p>Communicate encompasses all workflows for building a community.

By using VR to display locations in native american oral histories, students can \u201cvisit\u201d relevant locations and learn the culture and vocabulary surrounding these locations in little to no time or cost, especially since we are using low cost VR technology such as the Google Cardboard. </p>\n<p>During this hackathon we targeted Bitterroot Salish, a language that has under 1,000 living speakers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>culturED uses virtual reality to allow users to interact with locations that are relevant to oral histories of various groups, and learn their cultures and languages through this interaction. </p>\n<p>Using webVR, we are able to represent a significant cultural location in the form of the Madison Buffalo Jump and describe some of the histories and vocabularies of the buffalo jump. This location was used by numerous tribes including the Hidatsa, Shoshone, Lakota, Dakota, Nez Perce, Bannock, Arapaho, Salish, Cheyenne, Blackfeet, Crow, Gros Ventres, Cree and Assiniboine and is included in the oral histories of many of those.</p>\n<p>This means that our location is easily extendable to be applicable to the languages of these respective tribes. This technology is also easily applicable to other languages and locations. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>culturED is built using webVR and angular in the frontend. Our 3D images were graciously provided by <a href=\"http://runningwolf.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Running Wolf</a>. The recordings of Salish were part of a textbook series created by the Salish &amp; Pend d\u2019Oreille Culture Committee, Salish Kootenai College, and The Salish Institute Nk\u0313\u02b7usm, with specific language help provided by Ana Alonso.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Finding recorded vocabulary on a limited set of recordings was fairly difficult. We hope to expand this vocabulary by directly working with groups such as the Salish Kootenai College in the future. Also, since none of our team mates had learned WebVR in the past, it was difficult to get it up and running.</p>\n<h2>What's next for culturED</h2>\n<p>The Madison Buffalo Jump is included in many native american oral histories, so using the current scenes with different languages is possible in the future. Also, as other locations are added, this case study provides a strong basis for anything from classroom learning technologies to expansive language protection.</p>\n<h2>Special Thanks</h2>\n<p>Special thanks again to <a href=\"http://runningwolf.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Running Wolf</a> for the images, Ana Alonso, and the Salish &amp; Pend d\u2019Oreille Culture Committee, Salish Kootenai College, and The Salish Institute Nk\u0313\u02b7usm.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webgl\">webgl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">a-frame</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">facebook-webvr</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bern/hackduke2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bern/hackduke2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cise.ufl.edu/~bmarger/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cise.ufl.edu/~bmarger/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cise.ufl.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on building on webVR and checking the accuracy of the recordings we were using.
