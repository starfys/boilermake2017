It's the platform designed to manage assisted living, senior care, or rehabilitative facilities in a lightweight, open source package.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SKYSync provides an interface and monitoring solution that delivers urgent and significant information to Caregivers. It consists of an administrative web application and a companion Pebble smartwatch application that work in tandem. Residents are given smartwatches preloaded with the software, effectively establishing continuous monitoring for location, physical activity, sleeping habits, and more.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The webapp is built with PHP, Javascript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS with an underlying set of APIs driven by a MySQL database. This interfaces with the smartwatch running a PebbleJS application to exchange data between all three components. Frontend styling is provided by the <a href=\"http://materializecss.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Materialize</a> CSS framework. APIs used include Google Maps and Pushbullet.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many of our problems were minor issues with Javascript and JQuery. After some tinkering we were able to resolve most issues, and our dependence on JS for this project pushed us to better understand the language.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>The underlying backbone of the entire project was the most difficult yet rewarding component. We created an internal API to serve the appropriate data to each leg of the project (webapp and Pebble app), and this made the interactions more efficient and portable in the long run.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The group as a whole learned much about web technologies--throughout the project we were pushed to use unfamiliar approaches to the problems at hand and each of us took away lessons in data transportation, security, and wearables.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SKYSync+</h2>\n<p>SKYSync+ will benefit from more development. It is apparent that a tool of this nature has a place in the senior and health care industries, and the team looks forward to further exploring the future of the platform. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pushbullet\">pushbullet</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I developed the form that enabled caregivers to create new patient profiles, wrote requests to store patient information with our database, and pulled information from the database to display patient details in the dashboard.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Machine learning has become a pioneering technology in the field of computer science. We sought to build a hack that involved and built upon machine learning methods. Our mission with InstaTag is to provide a means for users to get the most out of their social media posts. As social media becomes a larger and larger part of everyday life, it becomes increasing more important for both businesses and nonprofits to optimize how they advertise. #InstaTag uses image recognition and machine learning to create hashtags that will produce the most likes. More likes means more coverage, and for businesses and nonprofits, that could ultimately improve profits and donations. So while the normal everyday user can use #InstaTag for their profile, our app has deeper implications with the evolving world of social media.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>InstaTag generates optimum hashtags by running image recognition on the uploaded image and generates hashtags against previously learned images and hashtags. We used machine learning with the Clarifai API on Instagram data to find which hashtags corresponded to the most likes per picture. Thus when a user uploads an image, we are able to generate optimal hashtags for their image.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Beaker to research optimal tag matching algorithms. We then used Java and JSoup to collect data about images, hashtags, and metadata from Instagram. We then applied machine learning on the data collected with Clarifai. Our frontend is built with HTML and Javascript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had challenges getting good tags for the images especially with less common words. We solved this by using a ranking heuristic. Scraping the JSON text also required some tricky regex magic.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We researched different kinds of machine learning methods in order to implement and effective and accurate hack.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">beaker</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jsoup\">jsoup</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">friendship</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["http://sharing.beakernotebook.com/gist/anonymous/44dd2e97206183a5e23b", "", "", "", ""]], ["WristWatch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/riNekkRqiW4?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WristWatch \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/334/151/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>It's an elegant solution for wrist monitoring.

So many great songs, movies, books... However, the content we can identify with the most is what is most relevant to our current stage in life. Content discovery services out there just don't capture this. What if there were a discovery service that would reveal to us new things based on where we are on our personal journey...</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PicktureThis is a photo-based music discovery service. Given a photo, PicktureThis will find a Spotify playlist perfect for the scene. The ideal version of PicktureThis would be a mobile app, where the user can capture a moment they are currently experiencing, and be catered a personalized music experience for that moment. PicktureThis is currently implemented as a web-app as a proof-of-concept.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Given a photo, we use Clarita's API to perform object and scene recognition. We then get a list of tags related to the photo. This list of tags is then mapped to 132 music genres using word vector similarity calculations. We used Google's word2vec word vector library to compute similarity between tags and genres. We select the genre that best matches the photo, and find a Spotify playlist in that genre using Spotify's API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many Many challenges with getting things set up, especially with installing python packages and setting up the website on Azure. We also had trouble conceptualizing how to find songs given photo tags. It was only after scouring through countless music APIs and realizing the limited search capability they provide did we think of using word vectors. Other challenges were neither of us had much experience programming web apps. There was a lot of learning on the go and troubleshooting, but it was well worth it!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud that we were able to get a web-app working. We could imagine that if this app were further developed it would be useful to many people. As a user you can compound on new experiences with new music, and the convenience of photo-based song discovery is definitely very appealing. For example, looking for new yoga music? Just take a picture of your class and a new playlist will be handpicked for you.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about web development, getting environments set up, doing API calls, a little bit about word vectors, and developed a lot of patience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PicktureThis</h2>\n<p>PicktureThis would be great as a mobile app. If we can have it interface with photo-sharing apps like Instagram then it would be even more useful to people. Also, music is only the beginning. PicktureThis can extend to catering movies, short films, poetry, art, books... With the rapid advancement of object and scene recognition technology, it will become more and more easy to discover content we can connect deeply with.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spotify\">spotify</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">word2vec</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ErnestChan/pickturethis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ErnestChan/pickturethis\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["StreamLighter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>We saw that during streams, many people want to see instant highlights right after a moment happens.

Our metric for a highlight was seeing the density of chat comments per second. We maintained a moving average of the density of comments and if the chat exploded in comments, we would start recording. Once the chat died down, we would end the recording, add 8-7 seconds of footage before the highlight started and about 5 seconds of footage after the highlight ended and that would be a highlight.</p>\n<p>We made a small web app to compliment this.

User location input, TRV overlayed sky map image, and raw flight telemetry data</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This project was inspired by Intuitive Machine's Terrestrial Return Vehicle (TRV) TRaVeller spacecraft, and the suggested project statement to \"let a user know if TRV is visible from their current location.\" The <a href=\"https://intuitivemachines.com/Aerospace/SpaceSystems/\" rel=\"nofollow\">TRV</a> is an automated precision return vehicle, designed to deliver a scientific payload to a Low Earth Orbit (and beyond) and autonomously re-enter the Earth's atmosphere for a safe, precision landing. The initial idea was to create an Android application based on the open source Google Sky Map project, allowing users to explore the current location of the TRV on their mobile devices -- an augmented reality window of the night sky.</p>\n<p>We also sat in the Google Cloud Platform workshop at HackRice and learned how to use Firebase to build real-time web applications, which was incorporated into the project's cloud infrastructure.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Spacecraft-Spotter is a web application that utilizes real telemetry data from the TRV to map its position in a simulated sky, allowing users to locate the vehicle in their own sky overhead as it makes its way home from the International Space Station. It was built to help people learn more about the TRV spacecraft and to interactively follow its mission in an engaging manner.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The web app runs on a virtual server on the Google Cloud Platform. The frontend web interface was built with HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, and Underscore.js. Backend cloud services were provided by Firebase, which hosted the static site and its data content. Geolocation API's from Google Maps and freegeoip were used to determine a user's location based on their IP address. Alternatively, the user can specify a different city or custom latitude/longitude. With this information, Stellarium (a planetarium software) can generate a simulated view of the sky from that location, showing exactly what you would see when you look up at the stars. This 180-degree FOV view was then exported to a PNG image.</p>\n<p>Intuitive Machines provided a CSV file of simulated telemetry data of a TRV landing from the ISS to Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. This CSV file contained over 200,000 data entries for various TRV characteristics including mission time, sensor states, propellant and engine statuses, velocity/acceleration, attitude quaternions, and more. A Python script utilized NumPy data structures to parse and manipulate the CSV data to determine the TRV's latitude, longitude, altitude, and flight path angle. A calculated transformation was done to map the spacecraft's lat/long coordinates into the user's sky perspective at a discrete timestep. A further transformation was done with ImageMagick to overlay an image of the TRV onto the Stellarium image, incorporating the spacecraft's position in the sky, flight path angle, and altitude. The TRV image rotates over time corresponding to the flight path, and the closer it gets to landing, the bigger it appears on the sky map.</p>\n<p>The output overlay image is then displayed back on the web interface. An extra feature was added to \"animate\" the flight by generating overlayed images at discrete timesteps and displaying them in sequential order.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into several challenges throughout this project. As a demo, the web application was functional, but not optimized for performance. The largest bottleneck on latency was due to having to run the Stellarium software locally on the server. We could not find a good, open web API to generate an image of the sky based on the user's location. So, we had to settle with an offline solution of Stellarium.</p>\n<p>It also took some time to fully interpret the telemetry data in the CSV file. Parsing the information is one task, but manipulating the data to ensure proper unit conversions and coordinate system transformations proved to be non-trivial. A less-than-ideal workaround was used to position the spacecraft into the sky image; it may not be 100% accurate, but it's good enough to display a landing pattern that can deceive the untrained eye.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>HackRice 2016 was both of our first hackathons, so we're proud to have gone through the experience (and to actually submit a project). We were fairly late in the game when we settled on this idea, so it was very rewarding to collaborate and see the project come alive. We were just a team of two this time around, but just imagine what we could do with a team of three!</p>\n<p>This was also Rohit's first Node.js application!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A lot! Both of us worked with new technologies and API's that we were previously unfamiliar with. We learned about Firebase and the Google Cloud Platform that same day from a locally-hosted seminar. We also learned about autonomous spacecraft landings, astronomy, celestial coordinates, and how MLH works.</p>\n<h2>What's next for spacecraft-spotter</h2>\n<p>There are so many more features that we could add to improve the functionality and performance of this project. Although it was fun to build, it is unlikely that we will revisit it. We live in different cities, and Rohit is finishing up his last semester of school!</p>\n<h2>Misc.</h2>\n<p>Hieu met Rohit at a shuttle stop in the visitors parking lot at Rice University in Houston, TX. They had both driven several hours from other cities (Hieu from Austin, Rohit from Arlington), and arrived on campus around 7pm to attend HackRice 2016. Both were completely lost, but managed to find their way to the hackathon with the help of three friendly Rice students. There, they shared a table together, discussing potential project ideas. Intuitive Machines was one of the hackathon's sponsors offering a special prize for working with their data set. With no other exciting prospective projects in mind, we went to work.</p>\n<h2>Fin.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stellarium</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/imagemagick\">imagemagick</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/underscorejs\">underscorejs</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/freegeoip\">freegeoip</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cheehieu/spacecraft-spotter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cheehieu/spacecraft-spotter\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on interpreting the spacecraft's telemetry data to transform and project the TRV onto the sky map.

All code has to be home-grown and Amerian made.</li>\n<li>Instead of \"True\" and \"False,\" we have \"fact\" and \"lie\"</li>\n<li>Only the most popular English words, Trump's favorite words, and current politician names can be used as variable names.</li>\n<li>Error messages are mostly quotes directly taken from Trump himself.</li>\n<li>All programs must end with \"America is great.\"</li>\n<li>Our language will automatically correct Forbes' $4.5B to $10B</li>\n<li>In it's raw form, TrumpScript is not compatible with Windows, because Trump isn't the type of guy to believe in PC</li>\n<li>The language is completely case insensitive</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Grammar</h2>\n<p>The grammar of the language is fairly convoluted, but here's a taste of the enlightened decisions we've made.</p>\n<p>Arithmetic operators:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>'+' and 'plus' do addition</li>\n<li>'-' and 'minus' do subtraction</li>\n<li>'*' and 'times' do multiplication</li>\n<li>'/' and 'over' do division</li>\n<li>'&lt;', 'less', 'fewer', and 'smaller' all evaluate to 'less than'</li>\n<li>'&gt;', 'more', 'greater', and 'larger' all evaluate to 'greater than'</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Control flow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use ',' and ';' to treat compound statements as a single evaluation, similar to how '()' are used in other languages</li>\n<li>Use ':' and '!' to define the scope of loops and if statements, similar to how '{}' is used in Java</li>\n<li>'if', 'else if', and 'else' do what you think they do</li>\n<li>'not', 'and', and 'or' do what you expect</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The exciting parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strings are denoted by double quotes (\"I love Trump\")</li>\n<li>The 'is' and 'are' keywords are used both to check for equality, and for assignment. To use for assignment, say something like 'Trump is great' or 'Democrats are dumb'. To use to check for equality, do the same but append a '?'. For example, you may need to ask yourself 'Trump is \"the best\"?' (although we all know that would evaluate to 'fact' anyway)</li>\n<li>Assignment can also be done via the 'make' keyword. E.g. 'Make America great' assigns the value of the variable 'great' to 'America'</li>\n<li>Printing to stdout can be done via 'tell' or 'say'</li>\n<li>While loops are denoted via 'as long as'. And that's the only type of loop you need anyway.</li>\n<li>If a 'word' (so anything that could be a variable name) is deemed unnecessary by the compiler, it's simply thrown away. So you can make truly self documenting code, or code that appear to read very very similarly to real speeches by the big man himself. You can find some interesting examples in our 'test/test_files' directory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But most importantly, Trump doesn't like to talk about his failures. So a lot of the time your code will fail, and it will do so silently. Just think of debugging as a fun little game.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>Created for HackRice (hack.rice.edu) by:</p>\n<p>Sam Shadwell, @samshadwell</p>\n<p>Dan Korn, @DnlRKorn</p>\n<p>Chris Brown, @CryoBrown</p>\n<p>Cannon Lewis, @cannon10100</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://samshadwell.github.io/TrumpScript/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://samshadwell.github.io/TrumpScript/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>samshadwell.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://makepythongreatagain.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://makepythongreatagain.org\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>makepythongreatagain.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote the basic barebones tokenizer that Sam refined, expanded, filled in all the keywords I forgot, and added the Easter eggs to, then slaved over the parsing while Dan and I tried to figure out Pythons abstract syntax tree class and he attempted to destroy it as only the single fluent TrumpScript user could.", "", ""]], ["StockTalk: The (not so) Ideal Stock Market", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ORQtQrWfdGA?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StockTalk: The (not so) Ideal Stock Market \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/552/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our logo and tabs.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StockTalk: The (not so) Ideal Stock Market \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/553/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>You can buy and sell shares as the value of companies increase or decrease in real time.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StockTalk: The (not so) Ideal Stock Market \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/334/156/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The tweets we read and filter show up under the stock prices.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by Ghandi, finance, and @realDonaldTrump (that's a joke).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project is a multi-player investment game in which the stock prices of three tech giants (Google, Microsoft, and Facebook) are controlled by the positive and negative tweets each company receives.

Family members and friends can upload old photographs or pictures of cherished items to a \"therapy Facebook account\" for the patient. This account is used to sign in to the app and give the therapist access to these pictures. From the therapist end, new patient information can be added and notes can be added about the progress of each patient. Family/friends can see these notes but not edit them.\nTo facilitate music therapy, the therapist goes to <a href=\"http://ec2-54-84-51-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com/hello\" rel=\"nofollow\">our music player</a> to play music from the server.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>Our Android app interfaces with an API built using Node.js. The patient database is built using MongoDB and Mongoose. The music player uses JavaScript and runs on our Node server.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>Ideally, our service would provide more fully integrated support for music therapy, such as in-app access to a wider variety of songs. Additionally, we would provide the ability to edit the patient's schedule through the app itself, as currently we only display their schedule.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ralphie9224/Alzheimers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ralphie9224/Alzheimers\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ec2-54-84-51-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com/hello\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ec2-54-84-51-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com/hello\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ec2-54-84-51-210.compute-1.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Strength Builder", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLoX_RdzoJs?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>HackRice</h1>\n<p>Strength Builder is a system that allows users to be able to quantify their rehabilitation progress.

Some patients usually become very depressed, because they can not see their progress. This is very debilitating because you need to believe you can recover in order to continue recovery. We built this system so that people can visually see their progress no matter how small it is.

Primarily we needed to make it easier for competitors to get around and enhance communication between competitors and organizers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This solutions serves as an all in one stop for any needs a participant at an event may have. Users can schedule which events they want to attend, get push notifications reminding them of upcoming events, get help from maps to get to the final destination, view contact information of organizers, and see what event other attendees are visiting.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our final solution used both a mobile and web front end, sharing a mutual backend hosted on heroku. The mobile side is used by the event-goers and is the portal through which they get access to all this useful information during the event. Meanwhile the website is used by the event organizers to set up events and send important notifications to subsets of the event-going population.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was our first experience using an MVC (model view controller) system. In addition to this we'd never used Ruby to program before or implemented a solution on the Heroku framework. There were many finicky details we ran into along the way regarding implementation, along with the more important issues of making sure the whole app came together in a well unified manner.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were especially proud of being able to successfully use an MVC model to represent our data as well as implementing a full stack framework with not one but two front ends.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned more about android development, mvc systems, database development, fullstack development, ruby, sinatra web servers, heroku hosting services, and using RESTful apis.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Liaise</h2>\n<p>We hope to further polish the app until it's ready for publishing to the Android App store. Along with this, we'd really like to look into developing an iOS counterpart to the current mobile frontend. This would allow us to receive maximum market saturation within the next few years.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">location</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rubygems\">rubygems</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sinatra\">sinatra</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">activerecord</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">push-notifications</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rake</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Rice Delivery", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Rice Delivery \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/334/280/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>rice_delivery</h1>\n<p>Rice Hoot/etc. Delivery Web App    </p>\n<h1>file structure</h1>\n<p>client:\n    - templates:\n        - accept_delivery - code for accepting deliveries\n        - create_order - code for creating a new order\n        - main_feed - feed of orders (filterable), make an order, access user profile + settings\n        - user_history - active orders, active deliveries, history\n        - user_profile - edit venmo, profile info</p>\n<p>collections:\n    - Mongo collections (active tasks (public), user tasks (private))</p>\n<p>public: image Assets, etc.</p>\n<p>server:\n    - </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/venmo\">venmo</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CarlosTheG/rice_delivery\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CarlosTheG/rice_delivery\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Helped iron out some of the details.

I feel that data structures and algorithms may seem daunting to individuals who are new to computer science. I feel confident that through the animation and active interaction of basic data structures, anyone can learn the basics of computer science and learn to love software.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Render currently provides an interactive experience with four basic data structures. Users are able to input nodes and elements while the interactions created are displayed in real time.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Render was created in Java making use of the JavaFX library. Each scene or window is an implementation of JavaFX's layout and control classes. The animations were made through the Application class and the methods pertaining to said library.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Some challenges I encountered were due to getting used to the GridPane node class which I had decided to use primarily for this project. Keeping width and height fields consistent within a considerable amount of layers had proved to cost many hours and pieces of paper, but in the end the convenience the Container provided had made the efforts worth it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm extremely proud of how clean and modern the project turned out to be. I felt some doubt in the initial decisions I made in designing the GUI but seeing the finished product makes me feel very accomplished.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a considerably amount of GUI development using JavaFX, as well as using CSS in the design of certain elements. I took a lot out of this project, and I will definitely use the skills and libraries I learned in future projects.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Render</h2>\n<p>I hope to add even more data structure animations as well as algorithm visuals. I plan on investing some time learning web development as well with the hopes of making Render more easily available as an open source academic resource.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/josh-marasigan/Render\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/josh-marasigan/Render\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["twith8", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"twith8 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/334/041/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>twith8</h2>\n<p>Project developed for hackRice</p>\n<h2>Our Story</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We're a bunch of novices here that are primarily familiar with front-end languages such as HTML, CSS, and JS with the exception of python.</p>\n<p>We initially had a more complicated idea, but we decided to take the less stressful(but still very stressful nonetheless) route and found a way to combine what little knowledge we have into a simple project. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>thus we have - Twith8</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>figuring out how to connect the front with the backend</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>we kind of figured out how to use flask for the firsrt time\nTwo members learned worked with python for the first time while the other used html,css, and javascript for the first time. </p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/starrynight56/twith8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/starrynight56/twith8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked primarily on the python backend.

You scan your facebook messaging app, and you have friends who have taken the class or could possibly help you, but you don't want to inefficiently send out a bulk amount of messages, hoping to get someone who will reply quickly. We were motivated by the idea that Rice should have a quick and easy way for people to indicate casual online \"office hours\" in a particular subject, so if person X indicates they are available to tutor via FB message from 10 PM - 2 AM on a certain day, person Y can immediately know to message person X and not stress over finding someone to help.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The design is simple. From the start page, users can either select to be a \"tutor\" or a \"student.\" If you choose to be a tutor, the app logs the user in via FB and asks what classes you're available to help, where you can indicate your availability to tutor for a certain day. Also, the tutor can remove any availability they've indicated in the past. On the student side, the student chooses a class they need help in and a list of tutors who can help them and what times they can help are listed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used two MySQL tables to store all the information, PHP for server-side scripting, Javascript, the FB Javascript SDK to handle logins, and HTML/CSS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We struggled to make it both user-friendly and simple, but we're proud of what we ended up doing. One challenge I didn't anticipate was that I made the design in a \"flow\" of different page elements appearing on a single page, so it would be easy to go from Page3 -&gt; Page 4 but not from Page4 -&gt; Page2.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It was my first hackathon, so I'm proud that I completed a project!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Organization is really important, as well as having a clear plan.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tutors @ Rice</h2>\n<p>Maybe, improving the features and proposing it to Rice Apps!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexhwang/ricetutors\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexhwang/ricetutors\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Class Connect", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NP4H2AzQsfg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Class Connect \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/924/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Log in page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Class Connect \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/925/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Course List</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Class Connect \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/926/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Class list screen</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted a easier way to connect with our classmates, especially after having gone through classes where group work and group studying were crucial to success. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Built for college students, once you log in with Facebook and enter your classes, it will automatically match\nyou with Facebook friends in your classes.

After that, several algorithms has managed to play this game automatically.<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22342854/what-is-the-optimal-algorithm-for-the-game-2048\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion on StackOverflow</a> However, most of those algorithm requires certain level of knowledge of the game. For example, arguably the best algorithm to solve this game is some variation of expectimax algorithm with heuristic builtin. We are interested in how we can attempt to develop a strategy with machine learning that does not require any knowledge of the game. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We built a wrapper on top of the game 2048 that allows our ml bot to control it. Then we applied the method NEAT(NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) developped by Ken Stanley. It use genetic algorithm to build a evolving neural network that starts simple but grow complex overtime. </p>\n<p>To train our neural network, we started with a neural network that has 16 input nodes each receiving the value of the tile on the game board, and 4 output nodes that represent four actions: up, down, left and right. We then created a large pool of random network that comes from our initial one. For each network, we trained it by feeding the game board to the input node, took the output and perform the right action, and repeated until it terminates. For each run, a fitness score based on how well the network did is assigned to the network. Then we <strong>mutate</strong>(adding new node to the network, creating new connections or deleting node) and <strong>cross breed</strong>(produce a new neural network that combine bits of two parents network) our pool of networks and evolve them over generation. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a wrapper on top of 2048 that controls the game, a node.js server that server as the messenger between the game and client that wants to control the game. We built our custom game controller and custom fitness function on top of ANJI, an open source NEAT implementation.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>As many other machine learning methods, there is a myriad of parameters that fine tune how the algorithm works. We spent time reading the NEAT paper and adjust the parameters until we reach a comfortable configuration. Also we do not have enough time</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We had fun learning new machine learning methods and seeing it in action.

Through the utilization of game theory, we can create an interesting game that fosters competition and enjoyment.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created a backend off of Heroku and Parse, which then powered our two pronged front end, both web and mobile. Our web was created utilizing python and HTML/CSS as well as bootstrap technologies. Our mobile platform was created using Swift and cocoa pods.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team was relatively inexperienced in programming, as well as hackathons, and we were a little lost in choosing an idea for this competition. We began with an overly ambitious project, which we realized, as time went on, that was simply impossible to complete within the short period of time. However, we managed to help each other to accomplish something together that none of us could have accomplished alone.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we could have created this product in such a short time. We managed to utilize two platforms as well as utilize backends that we were unfamiliar with. We learned a lot, and accomplished a lot as well.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a variety of programming concepts and skills, ranging from backend creation to bootstrapping to mobile development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for less IS more</h2>\n<p>Less is more is something that we believe can become a great product that will be used by millions of people worldwide. Through its simple interface and engaging gameplay, we are able to create the ultimate website for users to engage in prisoners dilemma with other users all across the globe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://riceless.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://riceless.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>riceless.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front-end web development for this project using HTML and CSS..", "", ""]], ["CeleBiddies", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Initially, we were working with the Muse to develop an app that would regulate REM Cycle sleep to make you more efficient with your time, however, it was hard to monetize this considering just purchasing the Muse is fairly expensive and it doesn't seem that many people are using it. We then spent the rest of the night searching for inspiration and came to talking about the PowerBall and how much money was being distributed and then remembered that people were making money off their Fantasy Football leagues on DraftKings.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Celebiddies allows you to bid on celebrities essentially adding them as draft picks to your lineup. The more volatile the celebrity (the more they are known for causing trouble which is determined by a machine learning algorithm), the more points you will receive if they do something great, however, the more points that can be potentially deducted if they do something bad. For example, Kanye decides to laugh at a baby in a parking lot and decides to throw away the baby's candy and Twitter finds out, if Kanye was in your line up ohh boy you are about to lose some points for his behavior.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Machine Learning algorithm to develop if a celebrity is receiving points off their score or are having points taken away from them. From here, an iOS app as well as a website was created. The iOS app is using a RestAPI to take the data and make it presentable and more engaging to mobile users.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some challenges we ran into were to connect everything and learning how to use AWS for the first time.

While the song is playing, you can click or type on your keyboard to match the beat of the song. An indicator will let you know if you're on-track.</p>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>Imagine you're in a crowd enjoying a concert. Everyone starts clapping and it sounds amazing! Then, as time goes on, the clapping drifts away from the music until the two seem completely unrelated.</p>\n<p>Isn't it horrible? We wanted to offer a website to help fix this! Here, you can learn to match a beat and get some practice doing so.</p>\n<h2>Fueled by Passion - And Other Things(tm)</h2>\n<p>The project is a JavaScript web application using <a href=\"https://phaser.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phaser.js</a> hosted as a Web App on <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Azure</a>.

To build this, we had to learn an entirely new language, an entirely new library, and still piece together all of the content for the project. It was a ton of fun, but this would probably have turned out a bit more polished if we possessed experience coming into this.</p>\n<p>Also, as it turns out, audio/input latency can be a major issue. Some machines run this fine, others can hardly play due to the audio/input lag. No idea how we could make this better.

That, and our sick beats, yo.</p>\n<p>Denise: <em>tiredly rolls eyes</em> You can't ask me question like this right now.</p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\n<p>Audio is difficult. It sounds easy, but it's not.</p>\n<p>You have to be sharp or your project will fall flat. This doesn't come naturally.</p>\n<p>When you get stuck, it's important to not lose your rhythm.

It helps calculate who won at the end by letting players submit which train segments they had by tracing the segments on a map, rather than counting up segments of various lengths (like other Ticket to Ride apps require).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Android Studio</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We never programmed with Android before, so everything.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Android</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Android</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ticket To Ride - Expanded Deck</h2>\n<p>More results at the end, to see what cards everyone had and when they drew them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mongoose700/HRBunnies182\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mongoose700/HRBunnies182\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Democratic DJ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNhdaV0Pb0k?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Democratic DJ \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/819/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Democratic DJ \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/825/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>About page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Democratic DJ \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/830/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Host's page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Democratic DJ \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/831/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Friend's page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Democratic DJ</h1>\n<p>Source code for the Democratic DJ web application created for HackRice 2016.</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<h3>Code Overview</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Front-end primarily implemented in HTML, CSS, AngularJS</li>\n<li>Back-end implemented using Node.js, Express, MongoDB</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>When music meets freedom!

Because of this, its hard to find time to fit in things like exercise and studying. We've tried using many different commercial planners, but none of them were able to help find time for everything. Unlike, other commercial planners, SmartPlanner plans when to do flexible events for you (exercising, studying) based around not only your appointments but also based on your own unique, personal preferences.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SmartPlanner lets users input all of there events in an easier to read calendar. This includes both one-time events and recurring events. Then, the user sets their preferences for what time of day (morning, afternoon, or night) they like to do their flexible events. Using these preferences, the SmartPlanner puts these flexible events into the user's calendar.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote the entire thing in Java and used Swing to create the user interface.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had very little experience with Front-End development or working with the Swing package. Learning how to use Swing was very challenging; we had to do a lot of research.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to finish our first Hackathon!!!!!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that coding something even as simple as a planner can be very challenging, especially given the 36 hour time constraint. We also learned a lot of new information about how to use Swing in java.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SmartPlanner</h2>\n<p>There are still a few bugs that need to be fixed, especially with the preference settings. Also, the user interface is extremely basic. We'd like to use something more advanced than Swing, so that we can create a more visually pleasing user experience.

One group worked on understanding the Google Maps API and implementing it with JavaScript and HTML.  Another group focused on creating a database with MongoDB and Flask on the back end.  The remaining member of our team focused on the webpage design and data entry.   </p>\n<p>This was the first hackathon for all five members of our team and when combining our subproblems, we ran into difficulties making the front end and back end meet.  We attempted our best to reconcile the work on the back end for the database, but ended up scrapping it and hardcoding a miniature database to pull data from for the demo.    </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The subgroup working on the Google Maps aspect of this hack had never used either JavaScript or any API before, so for them, successfully comprehending and implementing it in our program was a huge victory.  We managed to incorporate the webdesign with the Google Maps page to have the entire front end run together and look nice.

Shuffling through your music is time consuming and distracting. Music that is too slow or too fast cause our footsteps to be out of sync with the beat of our tunes, leaving us with a feeling of uneasiness, which all too often discourages exercising altogether. The right work out song matches your pace, because your feet have a beats per minute measure when you move. We created Pacer to keep your workout in perfect rhythm, listening to the music you love. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app synchronizes your music to match your work out. To begin, Pacer loads and analyzes your music files from your phone and organizes them by tempo. When you start moving, Pacer analyzes the accelerometer data gathered from your phone, identifies your steps and motions, and determines your pace. Throughout your workout, whether it be a run, walk, jumping jacks, or sit ups, Pacer keeps you motivated by playing music that meets or slightly pushes your pace, depending on your preference settings.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Android Studio and coded in Java to create an application for Android phones.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The two main functionalities that make up Pacer - analyzing sound files for beats and analyzing motion data for footsteps - are non-trivial topics being studied in research programs today. We quickly discovered that these problems could not be adequately solved by different importable libraries, causing us to make some tough choices. We decided that we most highly valued the accuracy and sensitivity of pace detection. One team member with a heavy math background worked with Gaussian curves and the peaks in motion data graphs to solve the problem in MatLab, meanwhile collaborating with another team member to translate this piece of code into Java for the Android application. </p>\n<p>An even more challenging task was finding the beats-per-minute of an audio file. After trying several libraries and reading about audio analysis algorithms from research papers, nothing came close to the accuracy needed to pair music with exercise. We decided to embrace the tradeoff and utilize the very human ability to identify beats. For each new song without a bpm measure recorded, Pacer plays the song and asks the user to tap along with the beat. We take this data and record it such that songs need not be analyzed more than once. Interestingly, this method of manually determining bpm is often faster than methods using beat-recognition programs. </p>\n<p>Partway through the hackathon, we learned that Spotify had a Running feature that offered very similar functionality to Pacer. After testing the Spotify feature, we learned that our painstaking choices for pace determination accuracy indeed pay off. By using our own analysis on accelerometer motion data, Pacer more generally detects jerking motions, allowing your workout to consist of any repetitive trackable motion - rather than only running. Pacer allows users to use their own music that they know and love - rather than a predetermined playlist - and dynamically changes songs to match a change of pace. While Spotify's Running tracks only paces within the 140-160 bpm range, Pacer accommodates a larger audience by widening detectable ranges significantly. </p>\n<h2>What we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Working through the challenges proved to us that Pacer is in fact a worthwhile endeavor. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Pacer</h2>\n<p>There are many great extended functionalities that can be added to Pacer. Customizing workouts, recording progress over time, and helping users set and reach goals are next on the docket.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jemitk/Pacer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jemitk/Pacer\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on front-end app UI and design.

Inspired by a demo in the HTC vive tour that involves painting, the team wanted to see if they could achieve the same effects using the myo armband and Unity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The application tracks the movement of the myo armband, allowing the user to \"paint\" on a virtual canvas by waving their arm while wearing the armband. As the user waves their arm, the object tracking the movement will move along in the application. The object leaves a trail of color as it moves, leaving the effect that the user is painting. The trail disappears after 5 seconds.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The team used the Unity engine and the myo armband and sdk to build the application. First, the team synced the myo armband with the laptop via the Myo Connect application and then map the myo armband to the mouse. Unity can detect the position of the mouse and therefore the position of the myo armband. We created a gameObject in Unity that moves along with the myo armband position. Then we added components such as a trail renderer to it which gives it a trail as it moves. We also created two white planes to serve as the \"canvas.\" </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Originally we planned to make this an immersive virtual reality experience by adding a head-mount-display component such as the Google Cardboard to view the Unity application. However, we run into problems with having the phone sync with the armband in one app while the unity app runs on the android platform. Unfortunately the team had to abandon the head-mount-display part of this project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Since this is the team's first time developing for the myo armband and many team member's first time using Unity, the team is proud that they accomplished the painting application.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned features of Unity such as adding components like the trail renderer to objects and learned to use the myo sdk.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Virtual Paintbrush</h2>\n<p>If the team had more time, the team would add features such as mapping certain gestures to control the brush size and brush color.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag

Site: Gerrymandered.net</h2>\n<p><a href=\"Gerrymandered.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerrymandered.net</a> was created by Yash Aggarwal, Sami Glasco, and Zeyi Lin during the weekend of January 15 - 17, 2016, for the <a href=\"http://hack.rice.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">2016 HackRice hackathon</a>. With the heated debates of the 2016 Presidential primary races already underway early in 2016, this website serves to underscore the continued importance of Congressional races even during Presidential election years.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The website allows users to enter a location within the United States and territories to see in which Congressional districts they live and who their Members of Congress are. Users can submit parts of a full address, a zip code, geographical coordinates, or use the browser-based location tool to pass in an address.</p>\n<p>Once a valid location in the 50 U.S. states or territories is entered, the user is greeted with the name and a map of his or her Congressional district. Below the map is more information about the lawmakers in each district, including the district representative in the House and the two state Senators. For citizens to engage, there are options to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>view these lawmakers' voting records for bills, resolutions, nominations, or other measures</li>\n<li>visit their websites</li>\n<li>contact them over the phone</li>\n<li>send documents to them via fax</li>\n<li>provide consituent feedback directly online</li>\n<li>like them on Facebook</li>\n<li>follow them on Twitter</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, there is an FAQ section to the site that explains the concept of gerrymandering and why it is electorally significant to the average voter. There is also a prompt to help build a broader base of eligible voters by linking to resources that help them to register to vote if they have not done so already.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Gerrymandered.net was built using the following tools:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://atom.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flask</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Maps API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api\" rel=\"nofollow\">govtrack.us API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Handlebars</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heroku</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://macdown.uranusjr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MacDown</a></li>\n<li>Map of the United States: <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-USA-states.PNG\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-USA-states.PNG</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/congress_api\" rel=\"nofollow\">The New York Times Congress API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://purecss.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PureCSS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Python</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://slack.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Slack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Sunlight Foundation API</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WebStorm</a></li>\n<li>...and a generous amount of food and caffeine from the hosts of HackRice</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Gerrymandered.net was not our first idea; we originally thought of a broadband comparison tool that would scrape the websites of various Internet Service Providers and give the user the best \"bang-for-buck\" Internet deal. However, this idea was already in very mature fruition--just see some of the talented work done by the folks at <a href=\"http://broadbandnow.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://broadbandnow.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Having scrapped our initial idea Saturday morning, the main challenge that our team encountered was the time crunch of finding a new idea. After a quick session of brainstorming, we were off to the races.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>HackRice was our first hackathon! There were many new experiences for the whole team but above all we were thrilled to follow through with this commitment and see this project come to fruition.</p>\n<p>In particular, for our first hackathon, we felt that we were able to iterate quickly and work together effectively. For example, being able to pick up the syntax of a new language like Python or explore new ways of using services like Heroku were fun learning opportunities that will prove invaluable in the future. For two of our group members, it was our first full stack website, and being able to transition between having a back-end and front-end role was fun.</p>\n<p>Another accomplishment we were proud of was exploring the hackathon from a more civic-minded perspective. In today's day and age it is easy to drown out voices in heated political debate, so we thought that any little tool to help quell those passions and bring about objectivity and transparency could help.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We primarily learned the power of APIs. Without the availability of numerous datasets, such as the ones made accessible by using APIs provided by <a href=\"https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api\" rel=\"nofollow\">govtrack.us</a>, <a href=\"https://sunlightfoundation.com/api/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Sunlight Foundation</a>, and <a href=\"http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/congress_api\" rel=\"nofollow\">the New York Times</a>, we would not have been able to easily access such rich historical data.</p>\n<p>On the otherhand, we also learned that sometimes APIs may have their own issues--one of the API calls that we used returned some inconsistent data. We actually ended up making our first API <a href=\"https://github.com/sunlightlabs/congress/issues/517\" rel=\"nofollow\">issue report</a> this way.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gerrymandered</h2>\n<p>A few things are left to do for the site, and with some extra time and tweaking, we think they can happen:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a graphical interpretation or visualization of Member of Congress' voting records over time</li>\n<li>state and local representative information</li>\n<li>exploration of other APIs, such as Google's Civic Information API--there's a whole new world out there!</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">atom</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">govtrack.us-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/handlebars-js\">handlebars.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">new-york-times-congress-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">purecss</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sunlight-labs-congress\">sunlight-labs-congress</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://gerrymandered.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gerrymandered.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gerrymandered.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zeyilin/gerrymandered.net/tree/gh-pages\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zeyilin/gerrymandered.net/tree/gh-pages\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["helped write some code", "wow\ni feel gerrymandered", "wrote code, helped write code"]], ["DeCoRe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Problem with Yelp:\n    * Lots of irrelevant material when it comes to deciding what to order\nSolution:\n    * DOOR - Deep Object-Oriented Recognition\n    * A quick way to process information and decide what to order and what to avoid\nMethod:\n    * Long Short-term Memory Embedded Neural Network that really understands the concept of food\n    * Essentially insert text (one sentence or 10 million reviews) and we will extract all of the food words</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>* The network doesn't use explicit dictionary (or else we won't be able to discover food terms not in list)\n* Network learns to categorize each food based on context, term freuquency, linguistic relationship to \n  search concept and neighboring words.

In these diseases, inflammation of the intestines causes a variety of unpleasant gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In the past, I performed examination on the intestinal bacteria of those suffering from these debilitating diseases in order to understand how the composition of these microbial communities change in the disease.</p>\n<p>Not only have I had some history of GI research, I've had GI problems myself; in addition, several of my friends have been diagnosed with conditions like CD and irritable bowl syndrome (IBS). I've been thinking a lot about the use of technology in improving quality of medical care, and that thought process and my own experience led me to this idea:\nDoctors, when presented with digestive problems, will often ask about frequency and consistency of bowel movements in order to gain insight into gastrointestinal health and abnormalities. Data on the duration of abnormalities (diarrhea or constipation) and patterns in abnormal bowl movements could provide insight into causative factors. However, it is often very hard for patients to remember information about their last bowel movement, so much as ones they had a week ago.</p>\n<p>I chose to utilize my new device, the Pebble Time, in order to solve this problem. I created an app for quick and easy recording of poo data. The Pebble is a good choice of device for a medical wearable, as it is compatible with both IOS and Android. Wearables are an exciting new trend in mobile technology. In my mind, they serve two major purposes: notifications &amp; haptic feedback; and quick access to simple functions which might otherwise be contained in mobile apps (requiring you to take out your phone). I hope to utilize this second purpose (quick entry) in developing a medical monitoring app that allows quick input of stool data. This data may later be analyzed and visualized for medical monitoring or research.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There are two components to this application: a Pebble WatchApp written in C which allows for quick entry of stool data; and a webserver/database/website which allows for data storage and viewing.</p>\n<p>The WatchApp allows the user to quickly enter in a value from the Bristol stool scale (a system which enables patients to easily &amp; intuitively communicate the consistency of feces to their doctor). Users simply scroll through a list of descriptions until they find one which matches their own - the entry is very speedy after a few uses. In the future, I will consider adding optional inputs for volume and presence of blood (these could be enabled on a phone-side config). Right now the watch face has been tested on Android, but should also work on IOS.</p>\n<p>The website, which can be found <a href=\"https://poopguru.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, is used to view the data which is recorded by the WatchApp. Right now, I have a server running a demonstration visualization for the data collected by my watch (or anyone running the app).</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This build took a full day of coding, in several different languages, and using several different sdks/frameworks. I began by developing the user interface for the Pebble WatchApp using C. This took a good bit of time as I am not an expert in C (this is actually my first major project incorporating C). </p>\n<p>I then developed three different javascript programs: the first runs on my mobile phone using the PebbleKit Javascript API; it is responsible for receiving the data sent from the C WatchApp (over bluetooth) and then sending that off to the web-server for entry into the database. The second is a node.js script which hosts a webserver, which can receive new data, store and retreive entries from the MongoDB, route, and serve data/webpages. The data which are output by the node.js server are used in the dashboard. I use the highcharts library to draw charts; the third script makes async JSON calls to the node.js server to fetch cleaned data, then creates and appends the charts.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge I ran into during this competition was formulating an idea. Many other participants came in with teams and ideas already prepared. I began by joining a team from the Google Sheet, but our original Pebble app concept fell through (a resource we thought was free actually cost 150k). We brainstormed for 3 hours, but failed to come up with any great solutions - I found it very difficult to brainstorm for such an open-ended challenge. I pitched this app idea to the group, but nobody wanted to join me, so I just began coding it as they brainstormed. I finished out the first night by getting a functional UI up and running.</p>\n<p>My other major challenge was an accident: on Sat. morning I was working on the WatchApp, when my computer ran out of power. When I rebooted, all of the files in my project directory (including my git repository) were corrupted. I had not yet created a remote repository, so all my progress was lost. I was not shaken, however, and I was able to use the C tricks I learned the first time around to rebuild all that I had lost within an hour or two.</p>\n<p>A small inconvenience: I had originally planned to use my free domain from domain.com to link to the dashboard. I registered for pooplogger.com, but unfortunately my domain-name has not yet been setup.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I overcame all of the major challenges I came across in the course of this hack: the inability to come up with a good idea with my original group, and the loss of my work. As a solo developer, I also think that I did a pretty good job on this large and multifaceted project.\nI'm also proud of this idea: it is simple, yet could have some significant implications for gastroenterological healthcare and research.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>All sorts of stuff! Practiced some C. Learned to think about ideas and iterate quickly. Got a hang of building watchapps for pebble. And met new people!</p>\n<h2>What's next for PoopLogger: Gastrointestinal Health Tracking on Pebble</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of features that could be added to this app. I believe the logical next step would be publishing this as an open source program, and incoporating my priority features. I might also want to introduce an account system to keep track of everyone's data; currently the dashboard is a proof of concept to demonstrate the capacity for visualization and includes all data. \nStarting today, I will be using this app myself to track my intestinal health!\nEventually, I would like to talk with healthcare providers and researchers to see if they could incorporate this sort of technology into their work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/highcharts\">highcharts</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://poopguru.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://poopguru.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>poopguru.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jpoles1/PoopLogger\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jpoles1/PoopLogger\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I made this.

Although she is actually really good at photoshopping random objects together, I thought maybe I can help this time to speed up her process in photoshop all the people she hates.

Tuition is is going up, but perhaps the more significant change is the price discrimination and the cost to the wealthy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">beaker</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">data-science</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://sharing.beakernotebook.com/gist/Avery-Whitaker/b1c8e4dae554933a3da6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sharing.beakernotebook.com/gist/Avery-Whitaker/b1c8e4dae554933a3da6\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sharing.beakernotebook.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["A Safe Safe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jg98_d1sxMw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h3>Welcome to A Safe Safe</h3>\n<p>This was a hackathon project developed during HackRice 2016.

However, the challenging and defending teams often change from round to round, and each player is trying to increase his or her individual score, regardless of which team they're on. The game's fluid partnerships combine bluffing and reading hand strength from poker with trick-taking strategy.</p>\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n<p>The game requires two 54-card decks (each containing one red joker and one black joker). A piece of paper to keep track of player ranks is recommended. Each player starts at rank 2 and promotes to ranks 3, 4, 5, ..., 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. After each round, the challenging team's score is tallied to determine whether either team's members will be promoted (see the Scoring section).</p>\n<h2>General Rules</h2>\n<p>There are two phases to each round of play: drawing cards and playing tricks. </p>\n<p>The game ends after a player is promoted from rank Ace. If multiple players at rank Ace are promoted in the same round, then they remain at rank Ace and gain bonus ranks (Ace+1, Ace+2, etc.) until there is only a single player with the highest rank at the end of a round. Alternatively, the game can be played for a fixed number of rounds, or the game could end after a player has passed an earlier rank (e.g. the game could end after a player is promoted from rank 10).</p>\n<h2>Drawing Phase</h2>\n<p>The drawing phase begins once the two decks of cards (including one red joker and one black joker in each deck) has been shuffled and placed in a stack within reach of all players. The player to the right of the KotH of the current round cuts the shuffled stack, and players draw cards one at a time into their hand, proceeding counter-clockwise, until there are eight cards left in the stack (thus each player will draw 20 cards), at which point the drawing phase ends.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the drawing phase is to determine the \"trump suit\" (all cards of the trump suit are trump cards), as the \"trump rank\" is determined by the rank of the KotH (e.g. if the KotH has rank Jack, then Jacks of any suit are trumps cards in that round). While drawing cards, players may look at their cards; if any player draws a card with the trump rank (following the example above, if any player draws a Jack), then that player can \"declare\" the trump suit by placing that card face up for all players to see (the declared trump suit would be the suit of the face-up card). If another player has a pair of identical (i.e. same suit and rank) cards of the trump rank, they can override the trump suit by placing that pair of cards face up, changing the trump suit to the suit of the pair of face-up cards. If no trump suit is declared when players have finished drawing cards (quite rare), then the KotH can verbally choose any one of the four suits to be the trump suit, and this declaration cannot be challenged.</p>\n<h2>Playing Phase</h2>\n<p>The playing phase begins with the KotH drawing the eight remaining cards into his or her hand. The KotH must place any of the eight cards now in his/her hand face-down as \"dead cards,\" which should be kept separate from the discarded cards during the hands of the round and should not be shown to any other players. Once the eight dead cards have been placed, the KotH must call for a teammate by calling the suit and rank of a non-trump card (e.g. \"King of Clubs\" or \"Ace of Diamonds\"). This \"called card\" determines which of the four remaining players will be the KotH's teammate; the first player to play the called card is the KotH's teammate, which makes the remaining three players the challengers. Once all players acknowledge the called card and trump suit and rank, the KotH can lead off the first trick, with play proceeding to the right (counter-clockwise).</p>\n<p>For the rest of the round, the strengths of the cards are, from strongest to weakest:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Red Jokers</li>\n<li>Black Jokers</li>\n<li>Cards that have the trump suit and trump rank</li>\n<li>Cards that have the trump rank but not the trump suit</li>\n<li>Cards that have the trump suit but not the trump rank, with Ace being the strongest, and 2 being the weakest (assuming that 2 isn't the trump rank)</li>\n<li>Cards that don't have the trump suit or the trump rank, with Ace being the strongest, and 2 being the weakest (again, assuming that 2 isn't the trump rank)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that when comparing two cards with equal standing (e.g. any two identical cards or any cards that have the trump rank but not the trump suit), the card played earlier in the trick is favored. The winner of the trick takes all of the cards that are worth points in the trick (if the defending team wins the trick, the points may be discarded since scoring only counts the challenging team's points), and then leads off the next trick. Only three ranks of cards are worth points: fives are worth five points, and tens and kings are worth ten points.</p>\n<p>Any single card or pair of identical (i.e. same suit and rank) cards can lead off a trick.</p>\n<h2>Scoring</h2>\n<p>At the end of the last trick of each round, the points won by the challenging team are summed. If the winner of the last trick is a member of the challenging team, this sum is incremented by double the point value of the eight dead cards that the KotH placed face-down to get the challengers' final score; otherwise, their final score is the total points that the challengers won in the round.</p>\n<p>If the challengers' team's final score is less than 80, then the KotH's teammate becomes the KotH of the next round, and if the challengers' final score is also 40 or greater, the defenders each gain one rank. If the challengers' final score is less than 40 but greater than 0, the defenders each gain two ranks. If the challengers' final score is 0, the defenders each gain three ranks.</p>\n<p>If the challengers' final score is 80 or greater, then the KotH of the next round is the challenging player closest to the KotH's right. If challengers' final score is also less than 120, no players gain any ranks. If the challengers' final score is at least 120 but less than 160, the challengers gain one rank. If the challengers' final score is at least 160 but less than 200, the challengers gain two ranks. If the challengers' final score is at least 200, the challengers gain three ranks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/perl\">perl</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexander-jiang/kingofthehill\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexander-jiang/kingofthehill\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]]]
