Soteria was named after the Greek goddess of safety and preservation from harm. The entire functionality of the application involves a web interface (to be used by any university's security control center), an iOS mobile application for students, an accompanying Pebble application for students as well as an iOS application for security personnel. The iOS application allows any university student to notify the university's security control center that they are walking back home (or to any other destination) and are willing to be tracked until they safely reach their destination. The control center can track the student's path and accordingly notifies the nearest available security personnel to keep an eye out for them. The student can use the application to immediately alert security in case of an emergency or imminent threat and can also call security or 911 at the tap of a button. The accompanying Pebble application allows any student who owns one to never have to pull out their phones to be protected by Soteria, which can prove useful in dire circumstances. Soteria has lots of room for improvement. We hope to move beyond campus security and focus on keeping entire communities safe in the future.</p>\n<p>Technologies used - Angular.js for the web application front-end,\n                                 Node.js and MongoDB for the back-end,\n                                 Objective-C for the iOS application,\n                                 JavaScript for the Pebble application</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/hophackss/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/hophackss/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the Pebble companion application and polished the UI/UX.", "I created on backend using node.JS + mongoDB.

All these people, especially the elderly, face serious risks in their everyday lives. Our team explored possible ways to improve the quality of life of these specific groups of people, and created Touch+.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Touch+ utilizes haptic feedback to allow users to better handle their surroundings. An I.R. distance sensor is attached to a custom 3-D printed mount below the wrist, and acts as a substitute for a traditional cane. Depth data gathered from the surroundings by the I.R. sensor are interpreted by a raspberryPi in the users pocket. After analysis, data is presented to the user by way of pulses on a Myo armband. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our system, at its core, is a dynamic interface. It allows many pieces of technology with huge potential to work together to create the best overall experience for the user. This experience starts with the Myo arm band, which can turn the entire system on with a simple flex of the wrist. Positioning data from the arm band is then sent to the rasPi, which decides on the correct postioning algorithm to use for the user's particular orientation in space at the moment. Data from the I.R. sensor, prototyped in this project by an xBox Kinect, is then gathered and transformed into a frequency. This frequency is sent back to the user's Myo, and is presented to the user via the Myo's haptic feedback features.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Interfacing so many different devices caused an entire host of challenges to occur. For instance, communication between incomplete or closed implementations of different products forced us to need to develop a brand new dymanic run time communication pipeline to maintain data flow and decrease communication latency.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have developed a portable, lightweight navigation system to aid the visually impaired. The communication latency between all devices in the system is nearly 0, and thus, the user relieves fast and accurate feedback about their environment. In testing, participants had no issue navigating twisting and turning hallways with their eyes closed. We attribute this success in testing to the optimization of feedback based on the position of the user's arm in space, which we gather using the Myo. Users can seamlessly transition from feeling for subtle bumps by pointing towards the ground, to search for far off walls by pointing directly in front of them. Finally, these positioning algorithms are entirely I.R. based, and thus, work just as well in complete darkness.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Every team member came out of the project with a much more knowledge of computer vision and hardware interfacing than they came in with. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Touch+</h2>\n<p>We would like to lose the prototype kinect sensor for a less bulky I.R. or L.I.D.A.R. sensor. We would like to continue to utilize the Myo armband, and further optimize the user experience by refining the dynamic arm position algorithm transitions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bstadt/Touch-hophacks2016-.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bstadt/Touch-hophacks2016-.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did most of the software on this project.

We\u2019d recently seen the new Star Wars movie, and were immediately hungry for more. Unable to bear the wait until the next movie comes out, we decided to see if we could write a program to automatically generate a screenplay for a new Star Wars movie. We were also very excited by the recent release of Google\u2019s TensorFlow API. We\u2019re strong believers in deep learning and saw this as a perfect fit for our task.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The specific language model we\u2019re using is an LSTM, a specific type of recurrent neural network. The LSTM reads the scripts for Star Wars films one character at a time, and tries to predict the next character. After a few hours, it becomes very good at doing this. We can then give it a starting seed, and then have it predict the next page of text. By doing this, it is effectively generating new content inspired by the patterns it finds in the training data.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Google\u2019s TensorFlow API to build our LSTM. TensorFlow allows us to have a strong amount of control over our network\u2019s architecture, and it has good support for GPU computation. This meant that we were able to train efficiently on an AWS GPU instance. The network itself uses one-hot encodings for every character in the training text, and then feeds this into two stacked hidden layers per LSTM cell, and then uses a softmax classifier to predict the one-hot vector of the next character. Using the Adam optimization algorithm, we can minimize the resulting perplexity with respect to the network weights.</p>\n<p>After training, we can generate text by feeding in a short seed word, and then incrementally computing the hidden states and then the predictions for the next character. We adjust the predictions using a temperature which can control how original vs. faithful the new text is compared to the training data, and then sample the character from the adjusted distribution.</p>\n<p>For the front-end, we developed a web application in Ruby on Rails, incorporating HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website provides a clean and approachable interface into the neural network parameters.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve done some work in TensorFlow previously on convolutional neural networks, which was relatively easy, but the framework for recurrent neural networks was more difficult to work with than we were expecting. It took us quite a while to understand how to generate data once we had trained the LSTM, but by reading up on the theory behind the networks we were able to figure it out. Andrej Karpathy has a blog post on RNNs that was particularly helpful in this regard. </p>\n<p>We also had some difficulty setting up the web server. It was an interesting (and painful) process of setting up the proper build environment for Ruby on Rails on our Amazon ec2 Instance and getting it to serve up our website to a public DNS.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we\u2019re proud of</h2>\n<p>The model does a very good job of learning the subtleties of the way that text in a screenplay is formatted. It quickly learns that the text is broken up into paragraphs, separated by character names in all caps, often centered on the page. It also learns how to construct vaguely meaningful sentences, which is very impressive considering that it is trained on a character by character basis, and has no understanding of words beforehand.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about how RNNs work through this project. Although we have some experience in other techniques, this was our first project on modeling text data, which came with its own unique challenges. It\u2019s interesting to think that our model knew absolutely nothing about the structure of our data, or even the way that characters are grouped together to form words. This makes our model highly generalizable, to the point that we could apply the same network architecture to learn how to model almost any other text or even arbitrary time-series data.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s next for The Force Ghost Writer</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s still a lot of parameter tuning that can be done to improve performance. We weren\u2019t able to conduct an exhaustive search over all hyperparameter values, but doing so could probably make our generated text a fair bit more realistic. We\u2019re also severely limited by the size of our dataset; all in all we have only half a megabyte of data in total, which is much less than is normally needed by deep learning models. Expanding on our dataset could give us much better results.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">deep-learning</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neural-networks</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">star-wars</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-tensorflow</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/asrivat1/TheForceGhostWriter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/asrivat1/TheForceGhostWriter\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front-end, including CSS and Html within the Twitter-Bootstrap design framework, and helped interface the front-end controls with the back-end implementation.", "", ""]], ["JHUCourseVisualizer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>JHUCourseVisualizer</h2>\n<p><em>Are you ever confused about what courses are prereqs?

Here in DC, when the potomac floods, sewage floods into the river, and the water becomes undrinkable. Lead pipes are scattered throughout the city, and leech into the water when the water system is flooded with chloramine. While residents often learn about water safety at home, it's difficult to find out about hazards when traveling. </p>\n<p>The disaster in Flint Michigan has brought attention to water safety. But the Flint story didn't gain national attention until December of 2015, even though the EPA cited major violations in Flint's water system months earlier. Going to the EPA's website and navigating their complex maze of datasets isn't something the average American has the time to do, but the data is something they need to be safe, whether at home, or when traveling. Imagine if the residents of Flint, and visitors to Flint, had water safety data at their finger tips.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WellSpring is an Android app that uses gps to report on water quality near you, using EPA and crowd-sourced data. It provides recommendations for users to protect themselves, given the water quality violations reported by local water systems through the EPA API. The application provides recommendations for water purification devices, as well as a set of tests that users can purchase to test their home water quality. Users can then add their test results to the database. This will eventually create a more detailed, neighborhood-level database about water quality and contamination. Crowd-sourced and EPA water tests are displayed on Google Maps. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>WellSpring was built in Java using Android-Studio. The database is hosted by Amazon Web Services. We scraped and parsed data from the EPA API, as well as additional EPA and state-level documents and sources. We also used the Zippopotam.us API to geocode the data, (in order to populate the database without running into the Google Maps rate-limiting). Tests and detailed information are displayed on Google Maps, along with general recommendations. In addition, users can purchase water quality tests (from Amazon) and use the app to contribute to the database. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The EPA API documentation does not describe field values, which are often represented as numbers rather than descriptive strings. For example, contaminants are listed by their code, and are described in a separate dataset, but the contaminant dataset does not include reference to the code number, which prevents merging of the data. We had to go down to scanned state-level reports in order to reconstruct contaminant and violation codes in order to create a meaningful database, and make meaningful recommendations.</p>\n<p>The guest internet connection was insufficient to continuously query the API and post to the database. We had to learn how to run the code off an Amazon Server in order to fill the database. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to create a final, usable, product. While there is room for improvement, the app as it stands can already help people by proving them with reliable, up to date information about water safety near them. It takes complex and opaque data and makes it easy to use. \nThe data in the EPA API mostly consists of codes with no keys, making it difficult for non-experts to use.

No one on the team had ever built a database on Amazon, or built a complete app. Everyone on the team learned a new skill to contribute to the whole. </p>\n<h2>What's next for WellSpring</h2>\n<p>We will contact the EPA to ask some questions about the data fields in order to provide more nuanced information within the app. Right now, we make general recommendations about how to handle categories of contaminants. By having more detailed information about contaminants, we can make more specific recommendations about, for example, how long to boil water (i.e. 3-minutes or 10-minutes), whether iodine tablets will kill pathogens in the water, and which filters are certified to remove chemicals in the local water system. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RobRoseKnows/water-map\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/RobRoseKnows/water-map\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Database design and wrappers.

The success of clinical trials are important to not only big stakeholders like pharmaceutical companies, researchers, physicians, but also ordinary people like taxpayers and special interests. Approximately $10 billion is spent funding clinical trials every year, yet there lacks a functional query tool that makes the results and successes of these expenditures transparent.  Even with very specific tools such as clinicaltrials.gov, finding the right clinical trial can be extremely frustrating. Failures in clinical trials are hardly ever reported, with approximately 10% of studies ever published. Of these 10%, most are difficult to find and locate on the clinicaltrials.gov website.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>CSI is a functional query tool that displays the best clinical trials (both ongoing and complete) in the nation around any disease. Given search parameter such as age, gender, and health status, CSI searches for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>clinical trials that our user would be eligible for by state. Finding the right clinical trial can be time-consuming, so we used parameters tin the study design of each research study to narrow down the best clinical trials going on in every single state</p></li>\n<li><p>clinical trials ordered by rank and reputation of the sponsor. Since a large number of clinical trials are completed without any results, we penalized sponsors who did not publish the results of their clinical trials.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Django as our back-end framework, with Javascript as out front-end. In Python, we scraped every single webpage in <a href=\"http://clinicaltrials.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://clinicaltrials.gov</a> into a SQL server database, which communicates with our Django back-end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Django has a high learning curve, and some problems we ran into include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>implementing the search functionality on the clinical trials database</li>\n<li>getting the UI to communicate with the back-end</li>\n<li>scraping the page sources of clinicaltrial.gov for more information that the Clinical Trials API does not give out</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This is our first Django project. As a team, we have an eclectic background in stacks such as Android, Flask, Meteor, and Raspberry Pi, but at this hackathon, we wanted to develop with something we haven't seen before. In addition to using the Clinical Trial API, we're proud of writing our own python tool that scrapes the the page sources of clinicaltrial.gov. None of us have had experiences developing UI before, so we're proud of getting more experience with javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CSI: Clinical Search Index</h2>\n<p>We hope to scale CSI further by giving our website more functionality, in which users could query for pharmaceuticals, and learn more about a disease just from the CSI website.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/highcharts\">highcharts</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/adam2392/clinicaltrials\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/adam2392/clinicaltrials\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["GoBet", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GoBet \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/301/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Splash</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My little brother is a HUGE fan of the video game, CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Operations) and one of the things he loves about it is its betting community, <a href=\"http://csgolounge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://csgolounge.com/</a>, which allows players to bet virtual items on e-sport tournaments.

Students either go to Barnes and Nobles and pay huge amounts of money for textbooks, or scour the internet in order to save some money in exchange for giving up their precious time. For an independent college student, the two most important things are arguably money and time. All around college campus, there are students looking for textbooks, but at the same time, what do students do with their old books? Drawing inspiration from the hectic Facebook group markets, we sought to create a more streamlined buying and selling interface for students to obtain textbooks from each other at a cheap price and at a low time cost.</p>\n<p>Challenge: The main challenge we ran into was storing user-inputted data, and then calling upon it using javascript. Also, users would want a simple interface to post their offers and search for what they need, forcing us to balance the information we could gleam from the users with the ease of use of the site.</p>\n<p>Action: Our web interface is essentially a online store, but instead of producing goods in a factory store far away, everything is kept in your proximity. By creating a platform where students with textbooks can sell to students in need of those textbooks, we have created a simple yet elegant crowd sourced textbook gathering engine. By keeping the textbook market in a small area, students can save time finding books, and find books for cheaper from their friends and classmates. Using HTML, Javascript, and CSS, we built a program that would connect buyers and sellers at the university and find buyers the best price for the materials they need while also making it easy for sellers to advertise unneeded textbooks.</p>\n<p>What we learned: We learned to format html files and utilize javascript on our pages and how to setup a domain that would be able to host our sites.</p>\n<p>What's next for mydtf.org: Next, we plan to host the domain and connect the program with our domain, mydtf.org, in order to put the website live, create accounts, and set up a timer for each bid function.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/stevenzhang18/MYDTF2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/stevenzhang18/MYDTF2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Vitalight", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vitalight \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/093/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Hardware</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vitalight \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/098/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Software</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Hypertension is a very prevalent but often overlooked disease.

Patients sacrifice so much of their time to attend the costly therapy sessions, only to struggle with their daily at-home exercises. Whether the patients are bored or simple don't have the necessary corrective feedback, patients of modern at-home physical therapy struggle to accurately complete their whole therapy regimen, resulting in complications, setbacks, and an overwhelming unnecessary cost for the patients and their families.</p>\n<h2>What We Do</h2>\n<p>HandE uses your laptop camera to track the motions of your hands. By providing an interactive mechanism for therapy, HandE allows for the patient to interact with the computer during their prescribed exercises. The app incorporates the exercises into a game, ensuring the patient is motivated to complete their exercises. HandE also has the potential to provide precise feedback on the patient's motions, track their daily improvements, and report completion data to their doctors and therapists.</p>\n<h2>Why We Do It</h2>\n<p>Our team is passionate about using our interests in image processing, machine learning, and computer vision to provide an important medical service to millions of people worldwide without requiring the use of outside hardware devices. We strive to change therapy, to truly bring therapy to the patient. </p>\n<h2>How We Do It</h2>\n<p>On technical side: we collected the data by taking around 400 pictures of our own hands motions. We isolated hand from its background using computer vision knowledge(opencv), compressed and encoded the images into small-sized, but good quality bitmaps in Python. We use machine learning algorithm in R such as K-means Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Ensemble models to classify the bitmaps into one of seven categories (six hand positions, one empty picture with no hand) . As we bring in more data points, the means of the clusters are more representative of themselves, therefore the more closer between the new points and a mean, the more likely it belongs to that clustering. Finally, this analysis then calculates and reports which motion is being performed. The game responds to the motion in the appropriate manner, as if the user had pressed a key or clicked the mouse.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the largest difficulties was isolating the hand. As powerful as OpenCV is, our team only had experience in haar cascades and facial detection. Isolating the hand required further ingenuity, forcing us to leverage our statistical background to conduct deep analysis on the cropped matrix of each hand image.</p>\n<p>Also, combining the back-end analytics, machine learning with the front end data collection and reaction was tricky. We ran into issues with library compatibility, cross platform issues, and even translating from R back to Python.</p>\n<p>Last but not the least, image with high resolution takes a lot of memory for personal computer. Usual software cannot process that large-scaled data. We come up with two resolutions for this. First is the dimension reduction using Principle Component Analysis, which poses difficulty for us to reduce the dimension for new data points. Then we come up with the idea of compressing the image while maintaining the aspect ratio of it.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">image-processin</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">app</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["GUI", "", ""]], ["Drip Drop", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Frigid shower temps in the morning</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Automatically warms shower to optimal temperature and diverts water to a secondary tank to conserve water and save energy.

Unfortunately, sometimes people do not make smart decisions when inebriated. Driving under the influence is one of the leading causes of death among teens and young adults because they may act without realizing how impaired they are. We thought of using the Sensor framework in Android as a way for people to self-check their impairment due to alcohol and make better informed decisions about getting home safely.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>BAC Logging.</strong>\nThe main screen of 2am acts as a log where users can keep a count of how many drinks they had. Based on this tally, as well as the elapsed time, 2am estimates your current BAC and the time at which you will be fully sober again (0 BAC). There is a button which refreshes the information, and another button, <em>Begin Testing</em>, which will begin the field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Field Sobriety Testing.</strong>\nThe first test is the line test, where the user walks in a straight line holding their phone. In this test, 2am records the gyroscopic motions of the device. The next test is the typing test, where the user has to type a sentence that appears on their screen. In this test, 2am records the speed and accuracy of the typing. The final test, the reaction test, involves a quick change of color to which the user responds by pressing the screen. 2am records the reaction time.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong>\nUltimately, 2am will take into account the BAC levels and the results to determine whether you are intoxicated and/or impaired. It is important to note that even if you are not legally intoxicated, you could be sufficiently impaired that your driving would be noticeably affected. Similarly, if you aren't impaired but are still legally intoxicated (above BAC=0.08), you could be charged with a DUI if pulled over while driving. Therefore, 2am evaluates your intoxication and your impairment independently from each other, and will provide appropriate cautionary advice depending on the results, such as call/text a contact, or flag a taxi or Uber.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For the logging part of the application, we created equations to calculate BAC as a factor of age, gender, weight, amount of alcohol consumed, and elapsed time since consumption. These equations were based on research conducted by the National District Attorneys Association.</p>\n<p>To better understand the effects of alcohol impairment, we considered the standard field sobriety tests used by police officers and decided that of these, the line test could be readily recreated using the gyroscope on the device. We also asked several of our peers who drink about how they feel it affects their motor or cognitive skills. From their input, we decided to use the typing test, as many said that texting on a phone was difficult for them when drunk. Finally, as reaction time is very pointedly related to the risk of getting into a motor vehicle accident, we decided to have this test be the final test that 2am performs.</p>\n<p>As this weekend was rush weekend for fraternity membership, we expected the freshman dorms to have many drunk students. So, Saturday at around 2 AM, James and Himanshu visited the freshman dorm AMR II. They asked several drunk and sober students in the dorm to walk in a straight line, heel to toe, while holding a Moto G 2nd Gen open to a debug app which logged gyroscopic data. Also, they had each participant type the sentence: <em>The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy brown dog.</em> onto the testing phone to see how their typing was affected. Finally, they measured the reaction time of each participant with the common ruler drop test. Based on the data collected, we calibrated the thresholds for normal and impaired results for each of the sobriety tests. The rest of Saturday was spent developing the entirety of 2am, and Sunday morning, James and Himanshu went back to AMR II with the largely complete app and tested it to see if 2am could accurately predict whether the patient was intoxicated.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>With only one proficient programmer (Tushar) in our group of four, the major challenge we had to deal with throughout the entire hackathon was how to manage our work and time so that certain parts of code would be ready at certain times to coincide with the write-ups and our field testing. We all had to help with writing code to the best of our abilities so nobody would be over/underworked.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we were able to successfully analyze gyroscopic data to determine how the motor skills of inebriated people varied from sober people. Based on the observed data, we were able to define a threshold which could accurately distinguish whether the user was sober or not.</p>\n<p>To rehash the time management challenge outlined previously, the smoothness with which we coordinated everything was something to be proud of. We were able to send two members out on both nights to collect data from the campus, write up an extensive guide for 2am, as well as a research report, and write all the SQL and Java code for the Android app, all within the 36 hours of hacking time.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we are all proud of ourselves. With the exception of CS-major TJ, we were all biomedical engineering students, but we took on the challenge of thinking like a computer scientist to help TJ write his Java and auxiliary code. We also used our skills in physics, math, and biology which formed the foundation of 2am. Our chief code-monkey, TJ, took on one marathon of a coding assignment, effectively single-handedly. Despite this, he never complained and would still take time to help with the other parts of creating 2am.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>All of us learned about Java and Android app development. Rohan specifically had to learn SQL from scratch to create the tracker which is used in the main logging screen of 2am.</p>\n<h2>What's next for 2am</h2>\n<p>If this application can successfully determine the impairment and intoxication of an individual, hopefully this app can go on the market and help people make smarter decisions on how they are going to make it home. An improvement to the software that could be made is to have the app use some kind of learning algorithm, where it will refine its own parameters as more and more users use the app to perform their field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p>In the future, one potential idea for the app is to make a business deal with taxis or Ubers where individuals can receive a discount on an Uber if they are not sober. This would expand the customer base of these transportation infrastructures, while providing an incentive for intoxicated people to avoid the dangerous decision to drive back home. One way that we can expand the technology being used in 2am is to see if the gyroscopic sensors in the phone could sense impairment in people who recently smokes marijuana, as current methods of testing for marijuana abuse are either very time-inspecific or expensive.</p>\n<p>#team2am</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/excel\">excel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/notepad\">notepad++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mspaint\">mspaint</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/z7garof\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tinyurl.com/z7garof\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tinyurl.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Data Analyst and Business Consultant ", "Database Integration and Chief Editor", "Lead Developer and Project Manager", "Head Writer and Field Researcher "]], ["Path Hero", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Path Hero \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/492/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Interface</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired to build Path Hero because we noticed that people, at the start of each semester, often scramble to find a good route to class.

It\u2019s difficult, especially for the organizer, to keep track of who is running late or may have to cancel last-minute. We wanted to create an event-planning app that would help avoid this hassle. The original idea actually sprouted from one of our teammates when he was running late for his meeting and he did not want to message the entire club. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>pointME allows users to create an event, and upon doing so, this creates an appointment where the user can chat with other event attendees, share files, and get directions to the event location. Each appointment also has a shareable link that is used to invite others to the event through Facebook. Most importantly, the appointment shows the location of the attendees via geolocation prior to the event, allowing easy visualization of who will be able to make it to the appointment on time, which the organizer and others can see to avoid hectic group messaging.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The basic skeleton of this application is built around phonoegap. For the front-end, we used html, css for the display, and javascript/jquery to make the app more responsive. To handle the back-end, we explored a JSON-based database called Firebase, which uses AngularJS. Most of the native-app-plugins were installed using cordova, and we implemented different API's from google and firebase to polish our application. We initially thought about handling the back-end using PHP and MySQL through ajax queries in javacscript, we figured that it would be too complicated since cordova doesn't support PHP. We developed locally using MAMP, which is a local apache server provider. It was a fun project!</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge for our team is learning the complex world of web-app development. Three of the four group members on our team have only meddled with html enough to print out \"Hello World!\", let alone css, cordova, onsen, firebase, and angular js. It is safe to assume that the team spent 70% of the Hackathon learning the syntax and nature of each language. On top of which, many features we wanted to implement required heavy use of online APIs. I think at this point, every one of us feel like we've read textbooks worth of documentations.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re extremely proud of all the features we were able to implement, even with our limited experience in web-app development. These include Facebook login, Facebook sharing, group chatting, and geolocation.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Oh man, where do I begin? As mentioned before, the team members have definitely developed a much more indepth understanding of web-app development. From front end coding to UI organization to collecting back end data. We feel like we grasped a much better idea of this industry, gained a ton of respect for others and are very inspired to continue to work in this genre. I think the most valuable lesson we learned is just how effective a team can be when everyone is easy going and works diligently on their task.</p>\n<h2>What's next for pointME</h2>\n<p>Stress aside, we all really enjoyed coding pointME. The project started off as an off hand idea and evolved into something we are all very proud to present. Of course, we will continue to upgrade and refine the app. We have many more functions such as car-pooling, estimation time to destination, and having every event placed neatly in a calendar. Until it is ready enough for us to seriously consider the business side of it. Our goal is to release/sell the app early 2017.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mamp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">onsen</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firechat\">firechat</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://sungwoopark.com/pointME\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sungwoopark.com/pointME\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sungwoopark.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front-end, UI, Implementations, Planning, Video", "Back-end, front-end, UI, Implementations, graphic", "", ""]], ["Footprint", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Footprint \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/319/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Statistics and metrics about such enormous topics as climate change and carbon footprint are often hard to reconcile with our understanding of our daily lives.

These cases fill up reservation slots, lengthen waiting times, and waste time that would be more valuable to a patient who could actually receive treatment from his/her GP. </p>\n<h2>Our Solution</h2>\n<p>Medvisor provides an online platform that has two login options: Patient and Doctor. Patients are able to submit their  healthcare complaints, including information about their symptoms and concerns. Doctors, who are only able to login by entering a valid medical licence number (or proof of their licence), can read the complaints submitted by the patients. They can then decide whether these patients would benefit from seeing a specialist, and if so, which one. Through redirecting these patients to the appropriate specialist, or upvoting the previous suggestions for patients who've already been redirected, doctors can help get rid of the intermediary step of going to a GP, making time for those really in need. Also, by receiving medical opinion from multiple doctors online, without having to travel to their GP's practice, patients also save time and money. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our web platform using JSP (Java Server Page) and Google AppEngine's API. We managed our database through Google Datastore (NoSQL). We also used a Bootstrap framework.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We did not know until very late, that JSP is considered ancient and is really not the most convenient way to setup a web platform for our purposes.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We believe that we have a significantly large audience who would truly benefit from our idea by receiving effective medical feedback efficiently. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that we should learn how to use Node.js, Django, or another popular, practical web platform building framework. We also learned a lot about JSP and Google AppEngine. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Medvisor</h2>\n<p>Perfecting functionality and UI. Encouraging Medvisor to be used by countries worldwide, especially developing countries where medical resources and professionals are much harder to access.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jsp\">jsp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">datastore</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://mymedvisor.appspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://mymedvisor.appspot.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mymedvisor.appspot.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["HealthMate", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HealthMate \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/151/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HealthMate \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/150/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HealthMate \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/175/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HealthMate \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/176/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HealthMate \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/343/177/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>What if we told you that there was something you could do to save up to 125,000 lives annually while lowering the cost of healthcare by up to 300 billion dollars?

Unsecured connections make us cringe, forms without validation make us tear our hair out, and the thought of manual memory management leaves us cowering in the corner.</p>\n<p>Worse than all of these specters, though, is an open wifi connection. Putting traffic on a public network is a nightmare; anyone with internet access and a quiet conscience can read it, and anyone with a little expertise on top has a good chance of being able to exploit it. However, not all people have the luxury of being able to remain online. In a sad piece of irony, such public networks are regularly used by the people who have the most to lose.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, we created <strong>PortNort</strong>, a simple pocket-portable network security solution. For the prospective user, it's a simple device. One simply connects PortNort to the wifi network, then connects himself to PortNort. WIth that simple gesture, she has given herself all of the protection Harsh and I have hidden under the hood.</p>\n<p>Should one wish to pry PortNort open however, he would find a great deal more. First, a whole host of simple network hardening tricks. This layer includes things like checking the MAC of a router (to ensure that it hasn't been spoofed), filtering out reverse-path packets (to avoid leaking private IP space), and ignoring ICMP redirects (to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks).

ATLAS then displays the videos containing the object that they searched for. \nATLAS leverages the latest computer vision research to identify objects that provide semantic phrases and words that categorize objects in videos. For example, a user could sync videos from their Facebook, Instagram, and Google Drive and then search for \u201cbicycle\u201d. Every video with a bicycle from different sources will then be displayed to the user.  This is also applicable on larger scale. For instance, on January 27th, just outside the Johns Hopkins\u2019 campus, there was an attempted kidnapping on a female student. A man in a minivan approached her with a gun, telling her to get in the car. She didn\u2019t listen and kept walking, later reporting it to campus security. It took at least two days, January 29th, to process the video feeds from traffic and security cameras to collect more information to help identify the man. However, if security had used ATLAS, they potentially could have identified the minivan much quicker by searching \u201cvan\u201d. Expediting the Identification the van sooner could have lead to actually finding the man responsible for the attempted kidnapping. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used TensorFlow libraries and other Python libraries to configure a strong CV analysis program that provides object recognition and labeling, to which we also interface with.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Complete integration of the front end communication with back end sever application.

By aggregating all the objects, we hope to relate objects to form action phrases. We would also like to use parallel programming, to harness GPU\u2019s computational power, to reduce processing time. In addition, we would like to target to a more specific audience and perhaps use ATLAS in government surveillance programs and medical services.  \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LatencyTDH/ATLAS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LatencyTDH/ATLAS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Developed main front-end components and assisted in developing with TensorFlow and modifying the shell script.", "", "", ""]], ["OpenTrckr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>OpenTrckr</h1>\n<p><strong>In the last year, the instances of cases of the Zika virus have exploded, and unfortunately the demographic that is the worst affected is pregnant women and their unborn children.
