</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>BookBuddy actually comes out of asking college students what they wish existed. When we were preparing to come to this competition, we asked several people in our department to tell us if there was anything they wished there was an app for. One of those ideas was an app to buy and sell used textbooks, which really resonated with us. Everyone's felt the sting of being forced to overpay for a book at the campus bookstore, and we thought we'd try to do something about it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>BookBuddy allows university students to find peers nearby to buy books from and sell books to. It saves everyone money by cutting out the middleman of resellers, and allows students to communicate anonymously until they are ready to pay. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built an Android app that interacts with a Python server which is running on a Raspberry Pi. The app is interactive with the user, allowing them to search, post, and chat, while the server keeps track of everyone's data. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The backend provided us with a number of challenges. None of us had previously done much back-end development, the most experience anyone had was setting up a LAMP server. Given this, the initial plan had been to aim for something user-friendly, building our backend as a REST API written in Python by using Django. However, as soon as the server was set up, it became apparent that the versions of Python that were installed on the Raspberry Pi were incompatible with the REST API frameworks available for Django. After fighting this for a while, we decided it was better just to pivot, and switch over to Flask. This still involved a considerable amount of Python wrangling, but in the end we got it up and running.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Honestly, we're proud that all the functionality is there and that it looks as nice as it does. Going in, we were doubtful we'd be able to pull together a fully functional app by the end of the time period, especially given the scope of this design and the relative lack of experience we had in these areas. From the start, we split up the responsibilities, delegating tasks to whoever we felt would be most efficient, and one of our priorities was getting a BitBucket repository set up so that we could collaborate as efficiently as possible. Somehow, we managed to get everything done. To be honest, we're still kinda surprised by how well delegation and collaboration worked. There is no way that any of us could have built anything this intricate on our own.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about databases and Android notifications. We also learned a good deal about UI design, through simple trial and error, as well as learning how to work with one another more efficiently. This is our second time working together on a project, and none of us have experience with designing systems that have both a front and back end up and running. Obviously it'd be a little silly for us to list every single facet of Android or Python that we learned about this weekend, so to sum up what we took away I'd say that what we really learned the most about was simply learning how to work together, whether that's in terms of people, software, or networking.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BookBuddy</h2>\n<p>We don't know! We'll probably do an interest survey once we get back to our school, and if enough people like the idea we might try to host it somewhere public. It's not an app that's likely to make a lot of money, but that wasn't what we were going for anyway. If we do continue on with it, there are still some features we'd like to add, and some functionality that could be streamlined in preparation for scaling. Overall, BookBuddy's future is uncertain, but it might well be available to college students one day, if they want it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on the front end, creating the user interface and navigation within the app.", "I primarily did the back end and networking.", "So far, I named it and have worked on graphics.

We, as many people do, wanted to integrate new technology with our passions. Our passion: music. We wanted to give people the fun, creative experience of playing a musical instrument without requiring a physical instrument. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MimeSound pairs virtual reality with motion sensing technology to give the user a truly immersive experience. MimeSound comes with an array of different instruments, easy to play, and fun to play with. The program contains a string-synth, bells, a lazer-harp, a drum kit, and a dubstep -thingy. Controls are simple and intuitive. Touch things with your hands.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>For hardware, we used a <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/kinect\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Kinect for Xbox 360</a> paired with the <a href=\"https://www.oculus.com/en-us/dk2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oculus Rift Development Kit 2</a>. For real-time-rendering we used <a href=\"http://www.unity3d.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unity 5</a>. We connected Unity, through nerds.de's <a href=\"http://www.nerds.de/en/loopbe1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">LoopBe1 internal midi port</a> to <a href=\"http://www.reaper.fm/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reaper</a>, a digital audio workstation, using Keijiro Takahashi's <a href=\"Keijiro%20Takahashi's%20Unity%20midi%20bridge%20asset\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unity midi bridge</a> asset. When a user triggers a sound, a midi signal is sent to Reaper which implements the sounds using a variety of VST's. We did all of our Unity scripting in <a href=\"https://www.visualstudio.com/vs-2015-product-editions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visual Studio 2015</a>, and all of our modeling in <a href=\"http://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Autodesk Maya 2014</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blender 3d</a>.  In order to link the Kinect with Unity 5, we used RF Solution's Kinect with MS-SDK <a href=\"https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/7747\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unity asset</a>.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>We had to manage many pieces of software in order to implement our project fully. We originally had the idea to build a theremin. We ran into issues with the virtual midi port, and decided, in the interest of time, to scrap it, and to implement the bells in its place. Another challenge that we faced during development was motion sickness. A lot of tweaks and settings were hard to get just right, so that not many people would get sick from feeling like they were moving without actually moving.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the way that everyone in the group contributed their own, unique talents to the project. Paul Biermann, used his musical knowledge in order to choose the scales and to build the sounds in the game using Reaper and VST's. Robert Young contributed his practiced knowledge of the C# language, coding most of the program. Nick Benge contributed to the group by leading and by navigating the interfaces of Unity, as well as some coding and modeling. Nick Pecka contributed to the group by modeling all of the objects in the program. We are also proud of creating a polished product within the time constraints. We had a functional prototype for one instrument by the end of the first night.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>For most of us, this was our first hackathon. We learned what hackathons are like. Among other things, we all learned how to connect 2 applications with MIDI, how to use Reaper and VSTs to customize sounds, Unity doesn't actually have support for mesh colliders, among other things.</p>\n<p>Sleep is good. Sleep is love; Sleep is life. </p>\n<p>Sleep is for the weak.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MimeSound</h2>\n<p>Optimally, we would not need Reaper in the background in order to run our program. If we had more time, we would find a more succinct way to implement the VST's. Hopefully, the program would be its own downloadable package and usable out-of-the-box. We would spend more time honing the graphics, adding textures, light, background, particle effects, and an avatar. We would add more instruments, sounds, and options into the game. Eventually, we may have several people playing at once. The possibilities are endless.</p>\n<h3>Tagline - <em>A virtual orchestra at your fingertips</em></h3>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">reaper</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maya\">maya</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/midi-js\">midi.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I came up with the idea, proposed the systems to connect together, and worked on scripting and level design.", "I did a lot of the scripting for actually playing the instruments.

We faced many challenges, yet gained so much knowledge and experience.  We came to HackISU open to any ideas and ready to learn.  We were offered the idea of creating a self balancing robot and decided to tackle the task.  We first started by creating the circuit with breadboards and later converted them to a PCB.  After it was converted we ran into some serious issues.  First, the motors didn't have enough torque.  Second, the motors were sending voltage back into the circuit breaking the connection to the gyroscope.  At this point, we were pretty stuck with the project, however, the amazing Rockwell Collins mentors John and Josh gave us the inspiration to continue on.  They helped us get the correct motors and solve the \"noise\" issue with the gyroscope.  Once these issues were solved, it was time to start programming.  We wrote everything in C using the Arduino IDE and implemented a PID controller.  After all this, the PID wasn't tuned to perfection, however, we had a working self balancing robot.", "", ""]], ["The Darkest Doors", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Darkest Doors \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/293/483/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My inspiration for this project came from a very disturbing and unsettling nightmare I once had.

The Arduino portion consists of a camera with a servo mechanism (that will move the camera) as well as a piezo element that will detect a door knock with the help of a signal amplifier, both of which are attached to an Arduino Mega. </p>\n<p>The PCDuino portion is responsible for pushing the notification and video stream to the Android phone once a knock is detected. Finally, the mobile phone is responsible for listening for the packet from the PCDuino.</p>\n<p>As for what went wrong, basically everything did. Getting Knock Knock up and running was rather challenging. Initially, we had looked into making a black bean turret that will be steered by an Occulus DK2 and fired at the flick of a Pebble Watch. Sadly, the person who was able to run the DK2 on their PC vanished, leaving us to find another idea Once we settled on Knock Knock, even more issues emerged. Firstly, the piezo element that would pick up a knock were difficult to work with due to its high sensitivity. Secondly, setting up the PCDuino took some time despite turning it on and off numerous times. Thirdly, finding a way to send a signal from the Arduino to the phone was far beyond the scope of what any one of us had worked with. And fourthly (not finally), even though there was a way to send data packets from the PCDuino, Android Studio didn't feel like receiving them.</p>\n<p>Given how stressful it was to set up Knock Knock was, we consider the fact that the computers and windows around our workspace remained intact as our greatest accomplishment. Asides from that, being able to come from absolutely nothing to a tolerable of something in the space of 36 hours in spite of the novel challenge as something to brag about.</p>\n<p>We learned that 1) Android is nasty 2) The Power of Collaboration as well as a lot of stuff relating to hardware as well as the Android Developer Environment, which is terrible.</p>\n<p>Next in line for Knock Knock is putting it on our doors! One of us was bad at answering the door and instead of turning down the volume, he saw it as appropriate to make an entire three piece set-up loaded on caffine in under 36 hours.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pcduino</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I tried to recearch how to work with the Pebble Watch as well as possible pass arounds to some problems.", "", "", ""]], ["CLMapps", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Our inspiration was the thought that it would be to it would be cool to see different things about cities.</h2>\n<p><strong>It allows people to search cities</strong></p>\n<h2>We built the back end in python and we used Google App Engine.

As an avid collector of blu rays I thought to myself, \"This would be cool to have for my 120 movie collection.  I was pretty new to programming and did know anything about arduinos or machinery so I never thought this would become a reality.  Over the past year I purchased several types of arduinos, rfid reader/writers/ and a buttload of solder.  I learned the basics one step at a time until I finally could talk like a true \"beginner\" arduino nerd.  The main goal was to build this machine.  I put together several SQL databases to practice how they would be collected, tested the working of stepper motors and servos, and figured out that you aren't supposed to touch the red and the black side of the wire at the same time.  Today is actually one of the more exciting days of my life, because almost all of my spare time at home has gone into trying to figure out exactly how to build this gosh for saken movie machine!  </p>\n<p>Upon purchasing a movie you push a button to find the movie and check it into the system.  Once you use the rfid to place it into a certain spot in the array of movies it will guide itself to the closest open location.  When you wan't to watch a movie you can either use the quick check out method where you simply press a button and scan the rfid in the moviebox.  Or you can use the integrated app to sort by movie title, genre, actor or any other prefered type.  Upon selection you will then press watch this and the movie will be dispenced checking it out for you.  </p>\n<p>I constructed a box I saw in my mind which would fit a good prototype.  Then I complied a list of all materials I may need.  WE used eprom to store data on the arduino so it would always have the locations of movies stored, even upon updating of software.  I used a 200 step stepper motor to move the gears and a whole lot of mistakes I will take as learning experiences for the real deal.</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge I ran into was cutting circles by hand.  Apparently human error is a thing, which ended up hurting the rotation in the end.  Also we had to create the movie holders by hand, instead of a nice machine that would do that work for us.  I hadn't done wood work for about 10 years and was concerned about using a hand saw for the cutting, but that worked out nicely.  Also I am insanely tired... but happy :)</p>\n<p>I did not think that this idea was a reality.  My brain kept telling me that it would be too hard and that it was too much for me to handle.  I am not lying when I say I failed about 50 times preparing for today.  It was a frustrating struggle to learn all of the thing nessesary but holy crap I made it work.  I was going to do a simple personal website because I didn't think I was ready to commit to making it.  However I changed my mind and could not be more excited.  This machine that half works and is not fully put together is one of the coolest things I have EVER done personally.  When I do go on and create the real thing with all the nuts and bolts and shiny lights and plexi glass covering the front with double or even triple spinning wheels, and my buddys come over to hang out.  They will see the grandeur that started as a simple box I made for a hackathon and be in awe when i tell them \"It was easy!\" :)</p>\n<p>I learned that wood is a pain.  You cant put back what you took away, and what you take away should probably stay taken away.  I learned that my brain unfortunatly is always telling you that some things are out of reach when really \"A lot of small steps, will eventually take you far!\".  I learned that builders and creators and inventors are the most suportive people, and they really do help drive the fire to be innovative and create and learn more and more.  This was really fun.</p>\n<p>My Cybox (\"Twohy's Movie Machine\") is a plan I will continue to create with.  This simple box with a few gears will be a beautiful piece of art in my home.  I will make the application work directly with the machine and continue to improve it.  I could not be happier with the result that WE came out with today, and am so excited to make machines do my cutting for me!!!!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vb</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tools</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">eprom</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rfid</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["ColorAnalyzer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>ColorAnalyzer</h1>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>We've all found ourselves looking through that massive collection of photos, trying to find that one image and berating ourselves for not using a better tagging system. \"I'll do it better next time, I swear!\" we say to ourselves.

After brainstorming, Kevin landed on the idea of creating a dashboard that displays time, speed, and distance traveled on a bike ride.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project displays distance, speed, and time of the bike on an LCD display.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In order to count the spokes on the bike, we used an IR LED and an IR photoreceptor to detect an interruption. These sensors are located on the back wheel. We then connected this to the arduino by way of a breadboard housed under the bike seat. Using the spoke count, our program then computed distance by multiplying a spoke to circumference ratio. To calculate time, we used the arduino's built in timer.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were going to implement a pebble display for our dashboard, but it turned out that without a bluetooth shield for the arduino we could not transmit our data to the pebble. Therefore, we removed the pebble from our project. We also ran into a problem where our lcd display would randomly stop working. After spending multiple hours troubleshooting, we discovered that we had soldered a bad connection onto the LCD panel. We eventually replaced it with a new one.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>After discovering that our IR receiver and transmitter system was too sensitive (It was oscillating interrupts on the edge of the beam) we added a new condition to our code. This condition stated that if there was multiple interrupts between a certain time period, then it would only count one of those interrupts. This length of time was based off a hypothetical max speed of a bike being 30 mph. Also, we are pretty proud of our project considering none of us had ever worked with hardware before.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned soldering skills, circuitry, arduino programming, and lots and lots of troubleshooting.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Bike Dashboard</h2>\n<p>We hope to integrate the bike dashboard with a smart watch in the future. This way the user would not need to mount the dashboard to the bike, and instead open the app on their watch and keep track of their stats that way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["eiko", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I was interested in the idea of quantity and if people could win something they would do it</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A place to give money and win money</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using HTML and asp.net I made a lot of the front end and some back end, did not have time to do much back end though</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning asp.net</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning asp.net</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>.........asp.net</p>\n<h2>What's next for eiko</h2>\n<p>Hopefully a decent back end</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/asp-net\">asp.net</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Ultimate Werewolf Mod", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ultimate Werewolf Mod \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/055/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1><em><strong>YE OLDE HACKATHONNE SCRIPTURE</strong></em></h1>\n<h2>Genesis</h2>\n<p>The nights..... they seem so long... why has our God [game master] forsaken us?

In the first few weeks, it grew rapidly in membership, almost doubling in size every week. We were soon contacted by various clubs and students interested in our web development services. However, we had a dilemma: What kind of web dev club would we be without a proper website?</p>\n<h2>Our Goal</h2>\n<p>We came to the hackathon to have fun and write code, but our hope was that by the end we would have at least a foundation for the website to grow from.</p>\n<h2>Why is Nicolas Cage everywhere?</h2>\n<p>Well, we needed image <a href=\"http://www.placecage.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">placeholders</a> for content until we could actually generate the real content for the website. It became a running joke, and I'm sure Mr. Cage will find a way to live on in the site after the official launch.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Web Development Club?</h2>\n<p>We have gotten a fantastic start to the club website, and we have many projects on the horizon! Our next major effort will be redesigning a website for a club on campus and continuing to improve our own site. For anyone interested in learning about and growing their skills in web development, come check out Web Development Club! <strong>We meet in Coover 1016 on Wednesdays from 4:10 - 5:00 pm.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://rawgit.com/ISU-WebDevClub/club-website/master/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rawgit.com/ISU-WebDevClub/club-website/master/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rawgit.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Created the Home page, About Us page, and logo.", "I created some pages, added dynamic content generation for some pages, and cleaned up some code.", "Created resources page.", ""]], ["NoteParse", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p><strong>no working demo</strong></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My messy notes and time spent organizing things.

We wanted to create a fun game where players could team up with anonymous opponents and think alike to create a tag for the given photo.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When you hit play, <em>ImageTag</em> pairs you up with a random opponent for each round of the game. For demonstration purposes, an image is generated using Flickr, though any photo source could be used. Once the timer starts, you have <strong>15</strong> seconds to both describe the given image with the same tag. If you both enter the same phrase, you are each awarded <strong>10 points</strong>, and move onto the next picture. You are given a total of <strong>2 minutes</strong> to score as many points as possible!\nAt the end of the game, you are shown all of the images you viewed, along with all of the tags submitted. You are also given the option to add your name to the <strong>Top Scores</strong> page.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We split our team into two parts- front end and back end development. The front end worked with CSS to create a presentable webpage for the game, including the <strong>Play Page</strong>, <strong>Help Page</strong>, and <strong>Top Scores</strong>. The back end, using C#, relies on SignalR to connect users to our web server. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we ran into several issues in the back end. The local IIS authentication to the SQL server proved too challenging to master in this short period of time, so databases did not end up working out for us.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we were able to create a working, fun end product. This is the first time that any of us had participated in a Hackathon, and it was great to see what we could collectively accomplish in 36 hours. We are proud that we were able to utilize Signal R/web sockets for client communication. Being able to get all of this functional in a short period of time was frustrating, but very worthwhile.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about how to use web sockets in a practical way. Some of us were also introduced to bootstrap and making the front end of a website practical and visually appealing. Overall, we each learned a different skill that helped us to work together to come up with a successful end product.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ImageTag</h2>\n<p>Ideally, we would like to improve some of the features of this web application. If we were to scale the project to reach a greater audience, some of the features would need to be made more efficient as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/net\">.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://imagetag.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://imagetag.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>imagetag.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["webcode", "", "", ""]], ["OffKey", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OffKey \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/517/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>OffKey</h1>\n<p>Hackathon Fall 2015\nA Project that uses raw sockets to authenticate users with public keys\nRunning Docker containers to provide all of the services</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hasjo/OffKey\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hasjo/OffKey\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["HackISU- Fun Homework Break Timer!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Every single member in this group was new to android development when the weekend began.

Not only that but you can see what your friends have watched and can make watch together lists with them! It also can give you suggestions of what to watch next based on what your friends have watched. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>After setting up our computers with all the software, we set up a git repository and divided the work up. We started learning Angular, working on building the database, and working with nodeJs. Using these we made the building blocks for the web app, the data management, and the database itself. From there we just had to combine our work into the finished product.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning the new languages and getting everything installed and working together was a huge problem, getting to the point where everyone's computers were on the same page took quite a bit of time and was frustrating.We also hit a couple blocks along the way just due to the newness of some of the syntax trying to make our code efficient.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>Group members learning new languages, several team member had never touched angular before and the integration of the laguages to make something cool was a huge accomplishment.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>So much practice with the languages new and old. (See below list) We learned so much in each of them and really got a larger understanding of how we can make them all work together for one project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for rovedb</h2>\n<p>We might continue poking around on it for fun in our free time, and hopefully our friends will get some use out of it. Who knows maybe it will even go father than that.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/neo4j\">neo4j</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">winjs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/grunt-js\">grunt.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coffeescript\">coffeescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["E.g., I worked on the backend and cleaned up our landing page's CSS.

For example, someone hosting a party can plug in their phone to their speakers, start a room in the app, and begin adding music which will trigger the app to begin playing the music. Once guests show up, the host can give out the room key and the guests will then be able to join the room on their phone and begin adding their own music to the playlist. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/youtube\">youtube</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cheerio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">request</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NAWilson9/DunkyBox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NAWilson9/DunkyBox\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["CyVivor", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanting to play with cool things!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a virtual reality world navigated with an Oculus Rift, a wii remote, and a myo to control your character and your offensive/defensive resources.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Unity with C#</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>No prior knowledge - mapping a wii remote in a 3D world</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>^^</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Everything!</p>\n<h2>What's next for CyAudit</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-modeling</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">virtual-reality</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Mrparkers/Hack_isu_official\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Mrparkers/Hack_isu_official\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["worked on auto turrets, as well as collisions of objects.

Especially around midterms and finals, it sucks to spend precious study time wandering around campus looking for the right spot. We think we can leverage our skills and the Internet of Things to solve this problem by making Iowa State\u2019s lecture halls, classrooms, and study spots \u201csmart.\u201d</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>Using the sensor hardware we built, we will be able to report the current occupancy status of a room to a user-friendly web application. This will be done in real-time, so all students have to do is go to our website, select a building, and we\u2019ll show them the open areas in that part of campus! With this new room occupancy information, students can make informed choices about where to study and meet.\nAs an added bonus, this hardware can also indicate whether the lights in a room are on or off. This allows the university to make informed decisions using analytics from our application about classroom usage, room popularity, energy consumption. Because of Iowa State\u2019s continued growth in enrollment, managing classroom usage effectively is more important than ever. The Occupancy Project will help Iowa State get the most out of their current buildings and be at the forefront of smart and sustainable technologies.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>At the core of our hardware, we used an Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 breakout WiFi microcontroller to connect to the ISU network and transmit the signals. For occupancy detection we used an IR sensor and photo resistors to determine light status. We used the Arduino IDE and C to program the hardware.\nOn the software end, we used Parse to manage the data received from the hardware and Materialize framework (CSS/JavaScript/HTML) for the front-end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>One of the big hurdles we encountered was getting the microcontroller to communicate the sensor data correctly. After spending hours modifying the circuit, rewiring ports, and adjusting power sources, we were finally able to obtain non-gibberish communication from the device.\nAnother issue we ran into was getting the microcontroller to correctly use the REST API to post sensor data to Parse. Because Parse only accepts HTTPS (secure) connections and the WiFi adapter on our microcontroller does not support them, we had to post to an intermediate server and then transmit the data from there to Parse.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>As a team primarily consisting of software-focused engineers, none of us was particularly experienced in the hardware aspect of our project. It was very rewarding to overcome the hardware and embedded systems difficulties and finally see the sensor data being transmitted over the ISU network to our database.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>Although some of the team had used Parse before, we all became more familiar with this powerful tool. We also learned how to configure a microcontroller to interact with sensors and communicate the data over the network correctly.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s Next For The Occupancy Project?</h2>\n<p>We think we can make this concept a reality and bring true value to ISU students. Our first goal is to get ECpE department permission to set up our system in rooms throughout Coover Hall as a test environment. Once we show the value of our product on this small scale, we will bring the idea to Student Government and request a wider implementation across campus. In the meantime, we will continue to build out our web application so that it\u2019s intuitive and easy-to-use.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">esp8266</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photoresistor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microcontroller</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://theoccupancyproject.parseapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://theoccupancyproject.parseapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>theoccupancyproject.parseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/samcennis/TheOccupancyProject\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/samcennis/TheOccupancyProject\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Email Notification Mystery Box", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/233/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/234/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/235/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/236/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/237/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/238/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/239/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/243/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Email Notification Mystery Box \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/277/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Often the number of unread emails in my inbox is a really quick way for me to know how much work I have to do.

If you are interested, you can follow @itwbaer or @foundryeprises on twitter for updates on its release :) Thanks!</p>\n<p>Main site page is anteup.online</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Code/Unity", "Title, art/visuals"]], ["Omega Suit ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1sSePYN051w?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/897/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/898/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/899/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/900/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/901/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/902/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/903/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/904/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Omega Suit  \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/292/905/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Friend built a light suit but it was rudimentary and hard to handle.
