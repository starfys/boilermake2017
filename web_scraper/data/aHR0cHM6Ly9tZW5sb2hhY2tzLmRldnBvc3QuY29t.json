We would leave everyday at exactly 7:20, and if I was late that meant we were late to school and received tardies. I wanted to use Uber because it would cost less than $6 for my short rides, however because of Uber's lack of reliability I couldn't. It could take anywhere from 1-15m, and I wake up at 6:51, leave at ~7:00, so even if I immediately called the Uber it could still be too late or they could be forced to wait up to ten minutes. I was forced to use more expensive Uber alternatives that allowed scheduling. It seem illogical that cheap, convenient Uber couldn't be used more reliably. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Schedule future rides and even create unique recurring schedules. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Ionic and Angular to create our front end, we used ngOath to have top of the line security and google cloud engine for our database and server. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>ngOath. The final and hardest part was setting up the Authorization to verify the user account and data and create top of the line security to protect both our users personal information and Uber's data. Uber actually won't even let you use call a car unless you implement their top of the line security protocols. </p>\n<p>Connecting the server to the fronted was additionally a major challenge for our team, especially given the time constraints. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>There are four major elements of the app that were significantly difficult to code.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The UI. We were inspired by material design, however we thought we could improve on it and make it better. We custom styled almost the entire app. </li>\n<li>The database. Our app has a working user database that stores rides and all the ride details. It's important the Uber works even if you're phone is dead so all processing and data is manipulated on the server. </li>\n<li>Uber's APIs. We successfully integrated numerous Uber API's. Connecting the server to the front also was not easy. </li>\n<li>ngOath. The final and hardest part was setting up the Authorization to verify the user account and data and create top of the line security to protect both our users personal information and Uber's data. Uber actually won't even let you use call a car unless you implement their top of the line security protocols. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that authorization is a complete pain, how to stay up all night, and how to take an actual design (wireframes) to a finished product in an extremely short amount of time. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Uber Scheduler</h2>\n<p>We need to finish working out the bugs and smoothing out the app. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AlexFine/MenloHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AlexFine/MenloHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["CodeCollab", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CodeCollab \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/739/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CodeCollab \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/740/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CodeCollab \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/741/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CodeCollab \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/742/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CodeCollab \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/743/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We came into today's hackathon without a team. We didn't know anyone, we had no clue what we're going to make, and honestly, that's one of the best parts of a hackathon - making new friends and coding something with a bunch of random people. But at the end of the day you want to have a solid idea, a great team, and also find a way to get to that hackathon. That's what CodeCollab does. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>CodeCollab is a platform for hackathon attendees all across America to post their next greatest ideas and form teams. Users can view the hackathons they will be attending, see the different ideas that other people have posted and join/make teams. If you have an idea of your own for a hackathon, you can add your idea to a list of ideas and specify who you're looking for, and how many members are needed in your team. Also, since a main issue for &lt;16 high schoolers is how to get to events, ride-sharing with other hackers, including your teammates is utilized.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started off with a Google App Engineer Server, written in Python to parse the MLH.io website and get the data of hackathons that were needed. The iOS app was completely written in Swift 2.0, Xcode 7.2. We used a Firebase backend to save the users and hackathon data, what ideas/teams they're in and more. We utilized MapView and GeoLocation to get routes and places of different users going to the hackathon.   We also created a web app that could list the hackathons and allow the joining of teams.  We also plan to add facebook integration so that people can contact their teams via facebook messenger.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest problem CodeCollab had was the integration of Firebase, and getting the information from the GAE to the iPhone app. It took us an extensive amount of time to get Firebase up and running, almost giving up at one point because Cocoapods was giving us numerous issues. The problem with GAE was that since there was so much information, the app loading time ranged around 20 seconds, and the parsing was done haphazardly. Last but not the least, we had some major trouble when it came to using the MapView with the geotags of the ridesharers.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're very happy that we were able to create  a functional app with a slick UI. We solved a major problem of idea collaboration, used a tricky backend - Firebase, and also integrated a Google App Engine Server, and various iPhone views. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Never leave database integration for the last thing. Before you even start the app, make sure that Firebase, Parse, etc. work and the functions can be called. Also, time management was key for our app. We spent too much time on the first view, which didn't leave much time for the rest, screwing our efficiency. </p>\n<h2>What's next for CodeCollab</h2>\n<p>We want to push CodeCollab into the hands of Hackers all across the World. We know that this tool can be used extensively by all new hackers, and even experienced ones to work on ideas that they like, meet new people and make new friends. As the creators of CodeCollab, we all wish this product existed and know it will help us.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TheCurryMan/CodeCollab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TheCurryMan/CodeCollab\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was a main iOS Developer, forming the major views + design, as well as creating backend Google App Engine and setting up Firebase.

Blood from Henry, the failed member of our crew, unfortunately a casualty of this Hackathon (a cactus was thrown at a shirtless Henry. We have not seen him since.)  Our sweat came from the incredible heat at the beginning.  Our gym doesn't have air circulation or conditioning, so there was a period of time near the beginning of this 24 hour period when we weren't sure that the oxygen content of the air we were breathing was regulation.  The tears came from Lauren, at 2 am, when the Hackathon had gotten the best of her, and her angst physically manifested itself in tears.  She recovered, but we haven't forgotten.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>For all intensive purposes, the three of us were beginners when it came to coding in IOS; 2 of us had never used Swift before, and the last member had very minimal experience.  Therefore, we encountered a lot of difficulty understanding Swift syntax and the Xcode IDE.  Furthermore, we had never used GitHub before, which resulted in a lot of (friendly) arguments among our members.  There was a time from around 2 to 3 in the morning where we were debugging an incredibly simple error.  But we prevailed, and were finally able to fix our code to a point of functionality.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we're proud that we're still alive to tell the tale of our first Hackathon.  We're proud that we created an application that has looks good and actually does</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>In these last 24 hours, we have learned so much, from GitHub to Xcode to Swift.  We started at a place where we couldn't program Hello World to a point where we are reasonably (we would like to think) functional.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for CitizStudy</h2>\n<p>What is next for CitizStudy? Where can we go from here? When you're standing at the top of the highest mountain, where do you think about going? You get a balloon.  Some helium.

That is when we came across the idea that to be able to detect depression, we could look at a sentiment analysis of a user\u2019s social media page to see how trends of emotion were seeming to go.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Epression  is able to use natural language processing technology and machine learning algorithms of integrated apis to extract semantic meta-data from content in order to obtain the necessary components from pages to have Alchemy\u2019s sentiment analyzer give us the analytics for social media pages being examined. From there, we are able to determine whether or not the sentiment in a particular user\u2019s social media page is uncommonly negative and if so, state that the account holder of the social media page should go to a physician to properly diagnose them and complete the necessary steps to get them help. A graph is also displayed, which portrays the change of sentiment in the social media page over time. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We integrated a variety of features in Alchemy\u2019s API into our project. We built the application using Ionic and AngularJS, which allowed us to test and deploy on iOS, web, and Android. We made our app take in social media page typed in by the user and then use ajax calls to obtain the necessary text from the social media page which was then analyzed by Alchemy\u2019s API and outputted a sentiment analysis of the text in a JSON file. We then parsed through the JSON file and got the necessary sentiment values we needed in order to classify the social media page. If the sentiment values were uncommonly negative then our app would display a message stating that the account holder of the social media page should visit a physician to see if they have depression as the sentiment analysis of their posts shows that they might.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Incorporating Alchemy\u2019s API was challenging as sending it the necessary info obtained from ajax calls was difficult as we had to experiment with passing different types of data without being able to manually parse through it to get the desired format. This caused us to have to use a variety of API calls before finally finding the right one. Also, using ionic caused us to run into some challenges as its format was not one that we were used to so it took some time to familiarize ourselves with it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Building it. This was not an easy project to build as we had to use many tools that we had not used before and experiment with them. Incorporating APIs while using angular js and ionic and parsing through JSON files was a complicated task  as we were not used to the format of the calls.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about working s a team throughout this hackathon as we were together for such a long period of time and had to regroup every few hours to make sure each one of us was on task and on pace to complete their part.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Epression</h2>\n<p>Expanding Epression to more than just a few media sites is the goal. In addition, incorporating sources for those depressed to get help on our app is another feature we would like to add.</p>\n<p>.tech domain \n<a href=\"http://www.epression.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.epression.tech</a></p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://aaronlopes.github.io/EpressionSite/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://aaronlopes.github.io/EpressionSite/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>aaronlopes.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AaronLopes/MenloHack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AaronLopes/MenloHack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://epression.tech.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://epression.tech.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>epression.tech.s3-website-us-west-1.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on backend, ajax calls and integrating alchemy api", "I worked on cleaning up the backend code, frontend, and hosting the code on different platforms"]], ["STEMinism", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>While girls at Menlo are encouraged to take computer science and other higher level STEM classes, we know that many girls around the country and the world do not have the kind of support from their teachers and parents that we do. If a girl can't take optional STEM classes in school, for whatever reason, we want to provide her with an alternative- a place where she can find resources online to give her the same opportunities her male peers have in school. We hope that with more access to STEM resources for middle and high-school aged girls, women will have equal representation as men in the STEM work force. Females also face adversity and discrimination when in the STEM field, and our website encourages girls to create their own networks with similarly minded peers so they have a support system to go through their high school career. We also hope to connect girls with female STEM mentors so they have someone to look up to. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our website provides girls with three main things- access to events, forums, and resources. Once someone signs up, they can post events or announcements, such as upcoming hackathons or internship opportunities, which will be displayed on a calendar. The second tab, the Forum, is a page where girls can ask questions and other girls, or mentors, can respond. The last tab is the Resources tab, which contains links to hand-picked tools and websites to learn about various topics in STEM.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML5 and CSS with Brackets to build our website after taking an hour-long course in CSS from Codeacademy. We also used GitHub to collaborate on our code with other members on our team.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Our main setback in this project was that none of us had any idea how to make a website, even though we had a solid idea of what we wanted to do. We had to take the course in CSS before we could start coding, but even after that, we faced difficulties in creating a website with the layout we wanted. We were able to use GitHub to collaborate, but we had many technical difficulties getting that started in the beginning. Lastly, because of a robotics competition earlier in the day, we arrived at the hackathon later than the other teams, leaving us with less time to design and build our website.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>From being complete novices at the beginning of the tournament to being able to help others at the end, we came a long way in our skills with HTML5 and CSS. We're all very proud that we were able to learn so much and gain experience with coding in such a short amount of time. Also, we worked on a time crunch the whole tournament because we arrived late, and we're very proud of the website we were able to build in this time, given our lack of experience.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>None of us had done a hackathon before, so it was an incredible learning experience for us. We had to stay up most of the night, working on a project that we didn't even know how to begin coding. This experience tested our focus after a long and tiring robotics tournament, and in turn tested our dedication to our project. We discovered what it took to stay motivated even in the face of challenges, and we even learned a few handy tricks about finding the tools to code what we wanted, such as looking at the page source of various websites. Also, at the beginning of the tournament, we all collaborated on the home page together, which turned out to be less efficient even though there were more people on the same page. It was very tricky to merge all our changes together into GitHub, so we decided to divide and conquer to code the different tabs of our website, working much faster. </p>\n<h2>What's next for STEMinism</h2>\n<p>Our main goal is to improve the quality of our pages, as well as include JavaScript to interact with the user as opposed to just a static webpage. Of course, we will have to acquire a lot more skills with making websites to achieve this goal, but given the speed with which we learned HTML5 and CSS, we're optimistic that we'll be able to do this in the near future. As for improving our pages, we hope to have an Events tab that takes into account the geographical location of the user before displaying events in that area. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.steminism.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.steminism.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.steminism.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["FriendlyFitness", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We thought about how America has an obesity problem.

Our project consists of 4 separate parts:\n+The Hardware - The Raspberry Pi, the power source, and the speakers\n+The Bluetooth Speaker Part (A2DP sink on the Pi)\n+The Light Server (A Flask Server that abstracts away the physical LED Strip protocols and allows for network addressing of the LED strip)\n+The Pulse Audio Analysis Script</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started by setting up the hardware (wiring up the lights, connecting the speakers), and then we followed that with getting audio to play over bluetooth to the pi and its speakers. From there, we worked on using the PulseAudio api to analyze the music being played, as well as created our own api for controlling the lights. We then merged these together. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a variety of challenges from both hardware and software perspectives. We encountered a phantom speaker that would randomly crackle in and out, and would play popping and crackling noises at high volume without being prompted. We solved this by cutting the cords to that particular part of the speaker and ignoring it, instead continuing our project with one speaker out of the pair. Next we encountered an issue in our documentation for PulseAudio, as there weren't any updated Java libraries, and they didn't have support for the functionality we wanted from pi's audio stack. We solved this by finding suitable python libraries, and spending time refreshing our memory on these parts of python to set up both a flask server and a PulseAudio interface which we used to take the Pi's audio output and then communicate with the pi. Additionally, we had spotty connection issues with the pi over bluetooth, which we tracked down to the wifi and bluetooth modules relying on the same antenna, and solved by disabling the wifi on our pi. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>In particular, we are proud of the power setup we had for both the pi and the LED strip, as it, despite consisting of a laptop power supply and a hacked together power converter, managed to reliably power the LED strip throughout the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned python and both using and setting up flask as well as more about the linux audio stack through our interactions with PulseAudio and using it for streaming. We also learned about audio analysis and fast-fourier transformations, and how we could use them to get the magnitude of the audio waves at various points. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Iris - Sound and Color</h2>\n<p>We hope to add more sophisticated synchronization and improve the update speed of the LEDs, as well as work out any minor interference or issues of the like we have left. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pulseaudio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bluez</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dotstars</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">blown-out-speaker-w/resident-ghoul</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sleep-deprivation</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">a2dp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">systemd</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rrbutani/Iris\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rrbutani/Iris\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rrbutani/SoundAndColor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rrbutani/SoundAndColor\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Oculus Rift Zelda Maze", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were interested exploring oculus rift and its legitimacy as a gaming platform.

In the program you are immersed into virtual reality through the oculus rift and use the arrow keys to move your character. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used unity 5, and created a maze by inserting numerous blocks over an image template on the plane that we had created. After this we added textures, lighting effects and music. We also added player movement and the ability to shift your movement with the camera direction rather than just having it be on one plane.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were a couple challenges that we ran into over the project. First, in the initial setup, none of us had every used an oculus rift with unity before so it took quite some time to just get it working. Also, unfortunately once we got it working the power to the oculus went out, crashing the program halting our progress. After much more work we finally got it back to where it was before. Our second big challenge was player movement. We experimented with a variety of different methods and finally decided to go with a character controller. We believed this was the most effective because it easily stopped players from going through walls in the maze and helped us create a better feels on the characters movement. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully created a working maze using the oculus rift and software we had never used before. We also solved many detailed problems, such as creating visual-based movement and implementing a player object that didn't clip through walls.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned numerous trouble-shooting skills, as we seemed to run into one problem after another.

The other user must enter a code (a signature of sorts) to confirm the debt. Next, users can view a list of their 'relationships' with their contacts: positive or negative net amounts owed. Within each contact's profile, users can create a transaction to resolve some of the debt. The other user will receive a notification to approve the transaction. Lastly, users can nudge others to remind them of debts.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this app using Xcode and Swift. We storyboarded the different windows of our app and then programmed the objects on our storyboard.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were all relatively new to iOS programming and came across a number of challenges along the way. We had trouble adding constraints to the objects on our storyboard. We also struggled with programming the keyboard on the app. There were some other programming issues we came across, but we used many online resources to find solutions to these problems.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of the fact that we were able to learn a lot of Objective C and incorporate it into our project. Additionally, we loved creating our own graphics for the app and a very punny name:P</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that making an app requires a lot more careful planning, thought, and evaluation of what is actually accomplishable than we previously thought. Some of us also had our first experience coding in Objective C and we learned a lot of syntax.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fordebt Me Not</h2>\n<p>As we were not able to complete all of the features of the app, our next step would be to code and finalize our original plans. In terms of new ideas, we might have our transactions feature deal with exchanging actual money between users electronically. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Text Adventure", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>All the ios games I've played as a childe</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a story about you, where you choose the adventure.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I just coded it using the most simple of tools in javascript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>After a while, all the branching paths were very very tedious to manage.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Starting from nothing, I'm really proud of everything I've learned</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This is my first application of code ever.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MenloHacks</h2>\n<p>I hope to learn more about coding, and try some more difficult codes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Phoenixx911/MenloHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Phoenixx911/MenloHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Drone VR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyNOz7U8ZZE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Drone VR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/517/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Drone VR</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Drone VR \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/345/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Hardware Used</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Drone VR \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/346/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Beta testing</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Drone VR \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/377/347/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>AR.Drone 2.0 Power Edition</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration...</h2>\n<p>We were inspired to undertake this project to combine two emerging technologies \u2014 Virtual Reality and Drones. Our goal was to create an immersive virtual reality experience using the A.R. Drone 2.0, a consumer-level quadcopter, and  Google Cardboard, an inexpensive and versatile VR headset.  </p>\n<h2>What it does...</h2>\n<p>The 720p video feed from the drone is broadcasted onto Google Cardboard, enabling the user to \u201cimmerse\u201d themselves in the drone\u2019s world. Additionally, the user can pilot the drone using a PS3 controller.</p>\n<h2>How we built it...</h2>\n<p>Using Node.js, we were able to broadcast the drone's video to a computer's localhost and control it with a PS3 controller. We then used Xcode and Swift to access the computer's localhost and convert the drone's video feed into Google Cardboard format. Finally, we used an app called Duet Display to enable the Google Cardboard to display the video stream.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into...</h2>\n<p>This project proved to be extremely difficult. We had several problems accessing the proprietary systems of the AR Drone. However, we comprised by using npm open-source libraries. Another extraordinary challenge we had was broadcasting the video to the iPhone with high resolution and low latency simultaneously. The drone stream worked perfectly on the iOS simulator, but the iPhone was unable to process the heavy input stream.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of...</h2>\n<p>One of our proudest achievements was getting over that hurdle of streaming high res video to the iPhone with low latency. We used an app named Duet Display as a workaround to mirror the drone video stream to the iPhone.</p>\n<h2>What we learned...</h2>\n<p>We learned that handling large video streams was an arduous task, and we had to learn how to use systems such as Web Sockets and compression.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Drone VR?</h2>\n<p>Potential future applications include aerial cinematography, military reconnaissance, and even disability assistance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">duet</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ar-drone</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ps3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ar-drone\">ar.drone</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">css-3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">atom</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/terminal\">terminal</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SFHSHacks/Virtual-Reality-Drone\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SFHSHacks/Virtual-Reality-Drone\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped with Node Js development and rendered the video stream using HTML", "Streaming the drone's video to localhost, formatting the server using html, and controlling the drone via ps3 controller.", "Design and iOS dev", ""]], ["Execute Order 66", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Emotions run high when coding and there is always member of the team that swears a little too much in github commits.

However, with the help of Mr. Amberg, we learnt about how Afero boards work and how to create IoT's.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we could do this whole project without any prior experience and formulate a new idea on the spot for our hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt about IoT's and how they operate, as well as the Afero board, and experimentation with the Arduino.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Threat Detector</h2>\n<p>We hope to use the Afero technology in other applications that can help others with hackathons and projects, as well as in the industrial world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">afero</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">grove</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kaushalpartani/529986b40858b6d5cb79a912acd46402\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/kaushalpartani/529986b40858b6d5cb79a912acd46402\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gist.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the hardware side of the Afero, such as connecting the wires to the sensors and Arduino, and beta testing the Android app  and Chrome Store app with the Afero board.", "I worked on the arduino file that combined the range sensor and LED Backlight. I also added the Afero board through software (and hardware through soldering) to enable notifications.", "I worked on code that used an ultrasonic sensor with the arduino in order to print out text/color on the LED. The output was based on the range of an object to the sensor. I additionally, tried to implement a simple iot using an afero module so that it could send notifications to a phone if an object was close to the sensor. Unfortunately, there were some issues with the module which didn't allow me and my teammates to implement said iot.

Maybe you don't understand soccer, but you want to be included with your friends and watch the game. With Sports Pal, you can select whatever game you're watching in baseball, soccer, basketball, or hockey, receive live play-by-play updates from ESPN, and be able to tap on keywords to see the definition. Sports Pal is intended to be a supplementary quick reference to the action you see on your TV.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]]]
