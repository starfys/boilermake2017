These goals were feasible, but were not reached due to a lack of motivation. Also, we, being fortunate enough to live in Silicon Valley, have opportunities that many others across the globe don\u2019t have. We wanted to make something that could potentially help those who do not have access to technology. Thus, striving to combine motivation and donation, we created Donation and Motivation Service, or DMS for short. </p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>A user sets a goal, a time limit, and a value online through our website. The value is the amount of money he/she will donate to charity if he/she do not complete the goal before the set deadline. In this system, motivation is both increased and maintained, and if he/she genuinely cannot achieve the goal, it will go towards a good cause. Specifically, that good cause is an established organization called \"Computers 4 Africa\", in which they use funds to ship computers to African schools for use. Also, through a social aspect of our product, users can draw inspiration from other fellow ambitious users through a real-time chat service. The service is also mobile friendly. Lastly, users get a kick out of our service through the tone of sarcasm throughout the experience. </p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We separated our project into two servers with the idea of having microservices. One server serves as a front-end and the other provides a back-end API with database operations. On the backend side, we ran Node.js as well as Express to create routes and endpoints for the frontend to access. For storing the data we used a lightweight and flexible npm module called LowDB, which essentially functions as a JSON file. On the front end side, we built a React application using Redux as a state machine. </p>\n<p>For the processing of money, we utilized Stripe\u2019s API to ensure secure transaction through credit card. In the chat server, we utilized AngularJS to process user data and messages, and PubNub API to stream the data in realtime.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>\n<p>To create the real-time chat server that supports multiple chat channels, We ran into many problems; We had no idea how to start or how to connect to PubNub, had difficulties with visibility of messages, and struggled through limited JavaScript knowledge. While we were all experienced with coding, we were also relatively new to the parts of the application we were working on. For example, Nathan, who is better with electronics, worked on the real-time chat aspect of the app. Meanwhile, Avik, who had never managed state client side, built a state machine on Redux. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We\u2019re Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the way our website turned out aestetically. It is very pleasing to the eye, and it took a long time to develop the styles through CSS.</p>\n<p>Instead of having everything on one server we were able to use microservices. This let us split our team into back and front end and work on each part separately making us far more efficient than if we had used only one server.</p>\n<p>In the real-time chat, users can either join a general channel or a channel specific to their goal. As previously mentioned, multiple channel server proved to be especially challenging, but we persevered and gained a lot of experience with JavaScript along the way - that is why we are proud of it.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We gained experience in and learned various programming skills. Among these are git, JavaScript, online transactions, proper code structure, node.js, and redux.js. Also, this is the first time we were in a group with each other, and most of us did not know each other. Thus, we had a great time getting to know each other and working as a team.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for DMS</h2>\n<p>We believe a lot of potential lies in this idea. We want to expand and improve our chat room, building it into even more of a social network, in addition to connecting it to social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram. Although it focuses on short-term goals at the moment, it can grow to incorporate long-term goals, bigger goals such as studying for the SAT in 6 months or losing 20 pounds in a year, with higher donation stakes. Lastly, it can grow to utilize hardware for users to physically and quantitatively track certain goals, such as motion sensors that add to the accuracy of fitness goals. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microservice</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stripe\">stripe</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/redux\">redux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pubnub\">pubnub</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lowdb</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://damnation-6825f.firebaseapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://damnation-6825f.firebaseapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>damnation-6825f.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://smhacksdonate.github.io/motivate/chat/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://smhacksdonate.github.io/motivate/chat/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>smhacksdonate.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the multi-channel chat server with PubNub and AngularJS.

Ctrl alt shift plus uvwxyz F1234, it takes forever to memorize them when you switch between different apps and programs.</p>\n<p>So we built this Open Source Keyboard. A tiny 36 key keypad that takes care of all the hotkeys for you. Hook it up with your device and write down what key combinations you want to input in the UI, you then could hit one button instead of 5 to give commands. </p>\n<p>For hardwares, we brought our tools here and made everything on ourselves from chips to buttons. For softwares, the program is coded using java, its serial port classes and JFrame for UI. It took us almost 24 hours to finish our prototype, in which we rewrote the codes and redesigned the UIs again and again to perfect the whole thing. </p>\n<p>We have learned a lot in this project. It's our first time using rxtx class to stream our data. And it took much time to debug: we simply need to coordinate between the ui, the port, and the keypad itself. Hopefully, our efforts had made this keypad user centered, delicate and efficient. </p>\n<p>Next step, we are planing to move this Keyboard to Android and make it an app. So maybe one day we could just lie on the sofa and get our computers under control with our phones.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jframe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["The Gift of Food", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/442/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The awesome webapp</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/444/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/451/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/395/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The ios app woot woot</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/408/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/394/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/391/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/392/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Gift of Food \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/393/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were still brainstorming ideas when we arrived at the hackathon. However, one thing struck as a big problem that still does not have a solution. The distribution of food. A lot of the subway sandwiches here were taken by people who later decided not to eat them. This often resulted in entire sandwiches gone to waste. After researching online, the facts and figures about the amount of food waste by restaurants shocked our team:\nFood loss per day amounted to 49,296,540 lbs in all full service restaurants and 85,063,390 lbs in all fast food restaurants.\nAfter seeing the problem, we came up with the solution, we came up with a food distribution system where extra food at the end of the day can be donated by donors to a nearby homeless center. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app, Food is a gift, takes food from potential donors who have extra food lying around and pairs volunteers to pick up food who in turn donate food to nearby homeless centers. Homeless centers are often neglected and do not receive as many as donations as they should. However, restaurants who have extra food at the end of day can put it up for donation rather than throw it away. </p>\n<p>There are two separate platforms for this project: a webapp and an ios app. We wanted to get a bigger user base and try some new platforms to learn at this hackathon. Both the webapp and ios app allow users to sign up and volunteer/donate food. Then it pairs them based on location and gives a notification on all the necessary details to aid a smooth delivery of food.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The webapp was designed using html5/css and react.js. React.js was used for building the user interface of the website and it updates the components of the website where the data gets updated and sent to firebase to be handled just like the ios app. The form handles the data from the volunteer and donor such as the time, date, and location. This in turn gets processed by firebase and handles the information necessary to convey to the volunteer. </p>\n<p>The mobile app was coded in swift using xcode. The backend of the ios app is connected to the firebase where all the data from the donors and volunteers are collected and stored. The backend does the handling to find the volunteers to the closest homeless center. On both the donor and volunteer page, they both see the location with a map. This uses mapkit which displays the location after getting the handling back from firebase. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>1.The map was not being updated accurately and was throwing false coordinates. To solve this, we had to research a better method of updating the map.\n2.We ran into a problem with bridging the C-code to swift code as we did not have much ios experience. \n3.Integrating firebase into the webapp and saving authentication was not working. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>1.Getting the ios app to work completely and integrated with the backend. Our team had limited experience with ios but we wanted a challenge and wanted to explore new platforms. \n2.The ui/ux of the website was very well designed as we spent time designing color schemes and icons.\n3.Getting the backend to be completely integrated along with the map as it was a major hurdle to pass\nWe are ultimately proud and thankful that we are able to make a product that can make a difference in people\u2019s lives and can help them for the better. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to develop a complete app in ios with integration on firebase. Previous to this hackathon, we didn\u2019t have much knowledge with swift and xcode. But now, our team can readily design and develop an app that integrates with firebase. There were a lot of nitty gritty bugs that were unknownst to our team while we are coding and struggled a lot. We learned how to implement maps and location in our project to aid our cause. We learned how to use authentication in firebase to validate the users who sign up. </p>\n<h2>What's next for The Gift of Food</h2>\n<p>Our goal is to continue improving the data handling and adding more features such as reminders using pubnub or twilio. Notifications can be sent to the volunteers and donors nearby. We want to talk to nearby homeless centers and hopefully even deploy in real-life as this project has shown us that even a student can be the difference for the impoverished. Incentives such as charity points can be given to donors. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">react.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/donumvictus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/donumvictus\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Developed the entire iOS application for The Gift of Food", "Developed the web application  using ReactJS.", ""]], ["FoodTracker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodTracker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/531/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The unhealthy eating habits of many people these days</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Each of the 5 food categories are listed.

Even though there are aisle descriptions, they are often vague and it's impossible to remember where each category of products is located. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using various APIs and algorithms, our app generates a store layout bitmap and animates the path that the consumer should take to minimize the time spent at the store and to pick up all groceries.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Bitmap - \nAs we didn't have access to an actual store layout, we created a mock bitmap in excel with 0's representing free space and 1's representing obstacles such as aisles, cashier counters etc. We then translated this into a bitmap of the whole store layout in Java.</p></li>\n<li><p>Pathfinding - \nOur app uses an existing database from Supermarket API which when given a product name returns aisle number and other product information for many prominent retailers. Using information about the location such as \"Aisle 11 Back\" we would then plot an exact coordinate on the bitmap that fills within the bounds of Aisle 11 back. After adding all our products to the list and having all the bitmap coordinates, we then had to find the most optimal route between all the points. This is essentially a different use case for the Traveling Salesman Problem except starting and ending point are the same, so using a slightly modified genetic algorithm we calculated the most efficient (or close to most efficient) route. Because the algorithm did not account for obstacles between the positions of the products, we implemented the A* algorithm on the bitmap matrix to find the best path between the individual points to avoid aisle and other obstacles. </p></li>\n<li><p>Firebase and UI - \nAfter adding an item to the grocery list and clicking the start button to map the path, the Supermarket API searches for that item's aisle number. The aisle number is a key for the possible coordinates within that aisle and a \"best fit\" position is returned. A major part of this app was designing the UI as in 8bit even though the animation was functional it was hard to interpret the store layout and where to go. We added numerous features to clarify this, such as animating the current path to the closest item, adding a pulse for the item we need to go to, and varying the sizes of the item points. See image above. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Pathfinding algorithms!!!! We had no clue where to start with this except that one of our members had some prior experience with TSP and we had heard of A*. Understanding how exactly these algorithms worked and how to integrate it took a lot of time. We spent at least 40% of our time designing the UI. Figuring out how to represent the store layout and then actually making the bitmap took some time as well.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Functional app that looks nice!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A lot! Android development (We hadn't really developed in Android only knew Java from CS class and had some experience with Studio), Pathfinding Algorithms, Firebase integration. </p>\n<h2>What's next for PinPoint</h2>\n<p>Integrating the shopping list with another app such as Evernote so consumers can import lists. Actually finding real store layouts (they exist somewhere) and figuring out how to efficiently create bitmaps of each.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">a*</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TheCurryMan/PinPoint\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TheCurryMan/PinPoint\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Implemented the TSP GA and the A* algorithm.

For each object drawn, a user can control a various set of properties, like position, color, size, and many others. It also scans your code for syntax errors and alerts you. Every time you make a change to your code, it is automatically saved in the cloud to your account, meaning you can access the code from anywhere without having to save.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"demo\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/F9sSQT1.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--1OTFe4x1--/http://i.imgur.com/F9sSQT1.png\"/></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started by creating data structures which contained properties for each element type. By using these data structures, we then iterate through each element using a loop and print each one programmatically to the canvas. On the other side of the editor, we created an algorithm that would take a user generated input, strip down all filler words, and get the basic meaning of the line of code. We can then use the output of this algorithm to set assign different properties to the data structure. This project totaled to around 1500 lines of code.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some of the hardest things to accomplish while creating our product were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Creating the algorithm to decipher the meaning of a user's code in English.</li>\n<li>Using data structures to effectively organize the large amounts of data created by our program</li>\n<li>Creating user accounts that can save code automatically</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were aiming to just get the language done, but we virtually had finished by 3am, and we were ecstatic to continue adding more functionality to our program, such as user accounts. By the end of the hackathon, we are proud to have created an algorithm that can effectively convert casual English to code, full with a beautiful UI and UX.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How to use a javascript 2D canvas</li>\n<li>How to efficiently organize big data for future use</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Pseudo Code</h2>\n<p>In the future, we hope to add more functionality to our program by adding logic and other features such as conditional statements and variables. This would add another layer of depth to Pseudo Code and we would love to continue spreading our passion of coding to the world of beginning programmers.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pseudo-code.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pseudo-code.org/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pseudo-code.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the language processing and a majority of the user interface!", ""]], ["Airports Web Page", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Airports Web Page \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/533/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>This is the Airport Webpage. </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Airports Web Page \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/539/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>This is Jet Blue one of the links from my webpage.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I always thought web development would be a cool way to express my ideas. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This web page talks about airports (I am a beginner)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Used codeacademy, google, html5, and css3. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Trying to make a button link. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Putting my mind together and using my resources. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>That html5 code has many attributes. </p>\n<h2>What's next for AirPort Web Page</h2>\n<p>I'm going to continue adding on to my skill along with adding onto the Airport WebPage. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Along with learning and applying more with html and css I started java script (really hard) so I can later apply it to web development.

Maybe you\u2019ve seen them once before, or maybe twice, and became curious about their name or other relevant movies they were cast in? </p>\n<p>The Solution: \nWell, we have a solution to this. Our android app can allow you to take a picture or a screenshot of this mystery celebrity and run it through a facial recognition API, returning the name and relevant features of this star, including other movies and a basic biography. This allows for you to get search results fast without having to go through the laborious process of searching through the whole movie cast. </p>\n<p>Technical Hurdles: \nSome technical hurdles we experienced were the multiple functioning difficulties of Android Studio, as well as the APIs we implemented. From connecting to the computer vision microsoft API, as well as the films API, to converting the file to the right form and setting the correct headers to the POST. We also encountered a hurdle when trying to save the image in the device after taking the picture so we could scan it through the the facial recognition procedure. </p>\n<p>Future: \nOur goals for the future of this app include finding and implementing a better API, as the time it takes to run the picture through the computer vision microsoft API can be a lengthy wait. We are thinking of adding more features to the celebrity profile it displays after you feed the app a picture, such as relevant actors/actresses they might\u2019ve filmed a movie with. This would all be displayed in an organized, modern day design.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/katm10/SMHacks2017\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/katm10/SMHacks2017\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Isaac", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Isaac</h2>\n<p>asdf</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/Zephyril/Isaac\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/Zephyril/Isaac\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Catch Apples", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I was inspired by my friend playing another game that looked very fun!

Of course, none of these items are perfect, but simply leave room for further improvement and development. Still, we are happy with the results considering the time constraint of &lt;24 hours.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about time management and working with Git. These were some of our biggest challenges and proved difficult to incorporate into our improvised workflow. However, we grew as a team and as programmers to collaborate and plan accordingly to accomodate our plans as group efforts.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Socratik</h2>\n<p>We still have a long way to go, such as more visual optimization and admin privilege implementation (for teachers) among other external and internal implementations that would further integrate more learning utilities for classroom use. We even planned a highly specialized socratic seminar mode for English or History classes, perhaps even assignment organizing databases.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongolab\">mongolab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">socket</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dsillman2000/SMHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dsillman2000/SMHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed the front-end using hand-tweaked Javascript and HTML along with custom made aesthetic image assets.", "I helped design the frontend and wrote the frontend AJAX code.", "I worked on the backend, implementing a REST API using node.js, express, and socket.io for instant communication.", ""]], ["Teender", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Teender \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/308/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Teender \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/298/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The iOS App Home Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Teender \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/501/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Chat on iOS App</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Teender \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/503/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Add Crush on iOS App</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Youtube Playlist: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyyLQUBDgDslwM5e0w2uUZHFKCebP67kM\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyyLQUBDgDslwM5e0w2uUZHFKCebP67kM</a></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by a friend who was having trouble asking his crush out. We soon realized that this was a problem plaguing many introverted high school students - that of having social anxiety of dating and relationships. We set out to make Teender to help awkward teens like ourselves overcome social anxiety.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><code>Teender</code> is a portmanteau of <code>teen</code> and  <code>Tinder</code>, the dating app. When a user logs into the app using Facebook, they are able to send an anonymous message to the crush of their choice (coming from their Facebook contacts). The crush will be able to see the anonymous message, but will not be able to see what the name of the person is.</p>\n<p>However, if the crush from the first scenario decides to send an anonymous message to his/her crush and that crush happens to be the user from the first scenario, then the app discovers that these two people mutually like each other. Then, the app reveals the names of the other person to each other, and the two crushers live happily ever after. :sparkles:</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>This diagram depicts the user flow, including some of the internal checks and actions that the app performs.\n<img alt=\"pix\" data-canonical-url=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GHZhTagsFV9Lcw4Kn8hTntcQ5DswGKzPVIkhv02xvMQBHa2XMQiCUOfa_84uS7R6zBqj06OJK95HS_A=w2879-h1511-rw\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--wPSaCDoL--/https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/GHZhTagsFV9Lcw4Kn8hTntcQ5DswGKzPVIkhv02xvMQBHa2XMQiCUOfa_84uS7R6zBqj06OJK95HS_A%3Dw2879-h1511-rw\"/>\nWe used Firebase as our realtime database, which stores data for our messaging and profile information. Both our iOS and Android applications access Firebase for messaging, enabling users to send and receive messages and notifications anywhere. Our cloud-based web back-end is written in Node.js and is running in an automatically scaling Heroku instance. It handles sending email invitations to the application, as well as monitoring Firebase for new users and other such administrative things.</p>\n<p>Several advanced measures are implemented to ensure the robustness of the application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Only Facebook friends can send crush messages to each other</li>\n<li>When a user wants to send a message to someone not using Teender, the app keeps track of the invitations and automatically syncs the user with the messages that had been sent to him.</li>\n<li>Anonymity is preserved by ensuring that only until both users have a crush on each other, the receiver of the messages does not know who it is.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h3>Facebook API</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The API is inconsistent in its restrictions. For instance, in searching for a user, depending on what characters are present in the query, it would limit the query to different lengths.</li>\n<li>It is not able to get the friend list of a user, which severely limits the practical usability of the API</li>\n<li>The API does not allow searching by email or many potentially useful fields, which unfortunately limits how much we were able to use the API.</li>\n<li>Doesn't allow querying globally all users; it randomly cuts off the query length</li>\n<li>Too many asynchronous operations</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because of all these issues, we had to store user invites as temporary accounts instead of searching the entire Facebook userbase once a user joined, which would make many things much, much easier.</p>\n<h3>Git issues</h3>\n<p>We ran into an issue in that one team member was signed into the wrong account, not allowing him to use the functionality of the git repository.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Authentication + Firebase</h3>\n<p>It just wouldn't work :sob: until later</p>\n<h3>Memory efficiency in chat messages</h3>\n<p>Sorting chat messages in chronological order without consuming too much memory, as well as ensuring the user's experience was seamless.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're very proud that we were able to build both an iOS and Android application during the 24 hours of the hackathon. Not only that, but we learned how to utilized Firebase for a realtime chat application, and we built a scalable back-end.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Advanced Firebase features such as messaging</li>\n<li>More advanced iOS concepts</li>\n<li>Android app\n\n<ul>\n<li>RxJava for asynchronous API calls</li>\n<li>Material design</li>\n<li>Glide for images</li>\n<li>Retrofit</li>\n<li>Facebook login</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Facebook + Firebase Authentication</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Teender</h2>\n<p>Enhancements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Streamline the chat interface</li>\n<li>Improve the user interface and experience</li>\n<li>Optimize all backend calls to reduce data usage</li>\n<li>AI for recommending cute messages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New Features:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Teender\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Teender\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the iOS App", "I built the Android app and designed the Firebase schema.", "I worked on the back-end web server, as well as marketing and product design."]], ["ToastTaled", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ToastTaled \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/495/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>First Level</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by many adventure/platform games such as Mario, and certain breakfast items.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a game so people can have fun</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We coded using html, css, and javascript</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>At one point, we had trouble with the collision with blocks.

We drive down to compete in hackathons in the Bay Area often, as there aren't so many in our area, and we often find ourselves in a world of cuisine foreign to us and our tastes. Foodle is an Android App dedicated to our team member Vasanth, someone who can never decide where to eat because he never quite knows if the taste is authentic or worth it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Foodle sets out to tackle these problems, by giving users the power to find out what restaurants local residents believe best represent the local culture, are worth the money, or just simply places anyone must visit. Alternatively, users can help review places they usually visit to best explain to strangers and tourist why your local Ramen place is simply the best.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Foodle using Android Studio, and collaboration through using Git to handle version control and push to BitBucket. We used many Google Apis, like Maps, Places, and Sign In to manage our users and the places they like to eat at. All of the information was moved through the cloud using Firebase to allow anyone to access their favorite restaurants anywhere.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Because our other team member, Dustin, drove us all the way down to San Mateo and is responsible for driving us back, he took a backseat in development to sleep so that he could drive us home safely.</p>\n<p>Our greatest challenge, however, was flushing out the design and architecture of the application, as our team had numerous arguments over what our final project actually should be. Many of us were building our own individual parts of the application during the first night, but as the sun came back up we finally came together to put it all together, with much greater efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Vasanth is especially proud of staying up for the entire twenty four hours, but I am proud of how all of use have , through SMHacks, mastered any of the Google APIs and are just beginning to unlock their potential. Perhaps in future projects, this understanding will help us make even cooler things with half of the hassle of async tasks and API calls. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As I described earlier, our challenges and successes taught all of us a lot about amazing software like the Google APIs, and the importance of good planning over blind hacking. Also, it is important to stay hydrated before sleeping, or you end up waking up with a coarse throat. Asking for help from mentors also helped us a lot, and being able to break out of our comfort zone to share ideas with strangers really helped both our project and our knowledge of what we were making.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Foodle</h2>\n<p>At the end of Smhacks, we even began to integrate stops other than food, but that feature remained unfinished in the final version. Maybe later we will finish that feature and expand local reviews to things other than food. We most likely will post the project online on Github and share it with our friends back home to see if anyone else is interested in helping us work on it to improve it.

What fascinated me most about this project was the combination of botany (although this algorithm is useful in many fields ranging from mathematics to linguistics) and computer science.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This project recreates the Lindenmayer System, also known as the L-System.  The L-System, developed by biologist Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968, was a grammar-based system for modelling the patterns of growth in plants.  This theory is founded on recursion, which occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type.  In coding, a function is being defined and applied within its own definition.  This is what creates the symmetrical branch patterns on the trees shown in this project.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using P5.js, I began by writing out the rules for the directions of each tree branch for each generation.  These came in the form of a string.  The ordering of each character within the string determines the direction of each tree branch, while the length (amount of characters in the string) determines amount of tree branches for each generation.  The characters and their meanings go as followed:</p>\n<p>'F':  Move forward\n'+':  Move right\n'-':  Move left\n'[':  Save current location\n']':  Restore previous location</p>\n<p>The ordering of these characters is random, and is different each time the code is run.  Finally, I used a pseudo-turtle graphics system to draw the branches.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One significant challenge I ran into was randomly sorting the strings so that each tree would have a different rule for branch formation each time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>One accomplishment that I'm proud of, albeit simple, was that I was able to use a string-based algorithm in drawing trees.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I became more well-versed on the concept of recursion, as well as sorting strings with JS.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Realistic Tree Generation with the Lindenmayer System</h2>\n<p>For future additions to this project, I plan on having the screen display the rules used for the tree branch transformations so users could get a better understanding of L-Systems.  Also, I eventually plan to allow users to input their own rules while given the characters and generate their own trees.  Finally, I want to come up with a better, integrated way to reset the tree for a new generation that doesn't just entail refreshing the page.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">p5.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://camille-004.github.io/L-System-Tree/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://camille-004.github.io/L-System-Tree/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>camille-004.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["3D Pong", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"3D Pong \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/397/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"3D Pong \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/398/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"3D Pong \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/399/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration came from nothing.

It is a 3Dimentional space that utilizes the space for the paddle.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built it with C# in Unity3D. With the occasional 8 crashes overnight...</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I ran into many challenges that include syntax error, just barely the incorrect logic, the web not having the right answers, and many useful mentors that left at 10pm</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I feel accomplished that I was able to finish this project at all. I knew that I was going to be able to finish it and feel proud about myself doing it. I was constantly going to mentors asking for help for my problems to get solved besides staying stuck, and watching youtube for excessive hours..</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned C# which is very similar to Java, also learned how to use the Unity api.</p>\n<h2>What's next for 3D Pong</h2>\n<p>What is next is what else I learn to do in Unity. For example, when I learn the Api for VR, i will do movement with the paddle with how you face.

Our team did not decide to pursue my idea, leaving it behind. But I realized there was potential behind my idea, so I decided to pursue this idea at a hackaton.</p>\n<h2>What Clubloop Does:</h2>\n<p>Clubloop is currently a prototype for a plug-in that would work for any school grading website(ie. School Loop, Aeries, ThinkWave, etc.). The objective of Clubloop is to allow school club leaders to efficiently contact club members with important information.</p>\n<h2>How I Built It:</h2>\n<p>To build the prototype of Clubloop, I went into inspect element on the School Loop website and copied the website in HTML into Notepad++. Afterwards, I coded the desired area for Clubloop to be in and added a couple of examples for what the news would look like.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I Had:</h2>\n<p>Most challenges that I ran into were related to HTML, since this is my first time ever using it to code. After get help from mentors and watching some tutorials, I was able to figure out the issues in the code and fix them. Another major area of challenge was GitHub and Git. I have never used either before, so it took time for me to get used to the functions of both. </p>\n<h2>What I Learned</h2>\n<p>I learned to clone, add, commit, and push code into Github by using Git and the command prompt, which really made me interested in HTML, a language that I have never used before. I believe that this experience will really change my coding life, since I am more static coder, using only Java and Android, but now I feel like I can become a more dynamic coder, using more variation of code.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for Clubloop:</h2>\n<p>Currently, Clubloop is just a plug-in prototype on School Loop, but in the near future I want to code a website with HTML and JavaScript, so that Clubloop can become a stand- alone site that people could use to keep track of club news. But my real goal is to propose this idea to School Loop, or any other school grading website, so they could implement it onto their website, which would help many students in the future to deliver and receive club news all on one site.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fleung48/clubloop\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fleung48/clubloop\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Photon Watch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Photon Watch \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/957/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Positive Green Slack Notification (Uses IBM Watson AI to determine if the comment was positive)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Photon Watch \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/959/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Negative Red Slack Notification (Uses IBM Watson AI to determine if the comment was negative)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Photon Watch \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/785/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Top View (Blue: Hour, Red:Minute)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Photon Watch \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/784/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Bottom View</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Photon Watch \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/950/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Purple: Overlap between minute and hour hands</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to incorporate the things that we learned in the workshops into a project that would showcase how much we have learned from this hachathon.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Photon Watch tells the user time through its LEDs arranged in a cirular fashion.

We are exceptionally proud of this since it caused us a lot of trouble and we were able to get past a large hurdle.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the Particle Photon development processes and how to impletement these principles for our own personal projects at home and in school.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Photon Watch</h2>\n<p>We would love to be able to connect the Photon watch with all kinds of messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger, Kik, Google Hangouts, etc. Also, we would like to make mobile apps so that users can customize their Photon Watch by changing the colors, sounds, and interactions for each button.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">particle-photon-internet-button-kit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">memes</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">soda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/caffeine\">caffeine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photon</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">libraries</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">people</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">multithreading</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">leds</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vibrate</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">motors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/accelerometer\">accelerometer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">buttons</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">basketball</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">foosball</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jokes</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dick</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">code</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">fuckmyex</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ayylmao</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cats</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">morememes</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dankmemes</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">slackapi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/slack\">slack</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">slackbot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ibm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neural-network</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ai</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">artificial-intelligence</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thelowell.xyz:3000\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.thelowell.xyz:3000\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.thelowell.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on putting it on AWS (ez), the server written in Node.js, debugging the shit photons, implementing IBM Watson, and memes.", "", ""]]]
