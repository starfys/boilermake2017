Thus, accurately predicting stock changes requires knowing which companies are currently trending in the public\u2019s favor. What StockAssist brings to the table that is unique to our generation is generating predictions based on social media trends. Older generations may look to news sources to inform them of which stocks to invest in, but this implies a lag of possibly weeks as news sources need to gather their data and edit it before publishing. By the time the news reaches the crowd, its advice may already be outdated. With StockAssist, we cut out this lag entirely and give you the real-time general consensus of how a company stands by data mining and implementing machine learning on social media posts. This will give the most accurate prediction of how stocks will fare, and thus is revolutionary in advising people with their stock investment decisions. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This web application will take the stock in question and collect all the news, social media, and statistical data about that stock. It will then run this data through our machine learning algorithms to analyze how well the company is doing in the eyes of the public. With this application, the users will only need to check one place to find an aggregated analysis of their stocks from a diverse, real-time generated data set. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The first iteration of the application was written in Go. After discovering incompatibility issues with the Azure platform, the application was completely rewritten in javascript using Node.js. The application consists of two main parts the server and client, with each communicating with another through http requests.\nThe server is where all of the heavy data manipulation is conducted. The server receives a query from the client via an HTTP GET request. The server then takes that query and using Twitter\u2019s REST search api finds 1000 tweets that match that query. Then using regular expressions, the server strips and removes all the referenced URLs (in order to make the semantic analysis easier). After the data has been prepared, we perform an analysis of the tweets using semantic analysis tools hosted on Azure. The analysis tool then returns a score based the words used, and from that we generate a confidence statistic.\nThe second part of the application consists of the client. As mentioned beforehand, the client sends a query to the server, and the server in turn returns a summary of the analysis it performed. The client then generates a stock recommendation based on a determining algorithm, displays a rough summary of that data using a pie chart, and gives a confidence statistic. The client was written in the standard HTML5/CSS/JavaScript while reference several other open source libraries for the visuals and the communications.     </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Developing a web application hosted on Microsoft Azure was our biggest challenge. Initially, our team used Go to develop the back-end of the application; however, Azure never seemed to be compatible with Go. Thus, we had to switch languages, and completely re-write the entire back-end in Node.js. Another challenge we faced along the lines of Microsoft Azure was figuring out the Machine Learning. It was difficult to create training models with the help of different statistics such as chi-squared. We attempted to create an optimal training model on twitter feeds based on binary sentiment analysis. Upon building the training models, it was another challenge to create a predictive experiment based on the optimized training model, and hosting the solution on the web. Although we couldn't get the machine learning algorithm to work, we made great headway in learning this sector of Microsoft Azure. </p>\n<h1>Accomplishments</h1>\n<p>Despite all the challenges present, we were able to finally implement Microsoft Azure as a web host for our application. Even though we did not completely figure out the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, we made great progress in learning how to utilize this tool to perform sentiment analysis on twitter feeds. In order to actually create the machine learning, we used a direct approach with sentiment analysis through node.js. On the front-end, we were able to coordinate all the back-end to co-exist with the front-end. The most important accomplishment was to develop the Azure hosting service, along with our web application.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This hackathon was full of twists and turns and we definitely learned a lot from it. From how to use Azure to what web frameworks work best with our front end, our general takeaway for this hackathon was to remember to reach out for help. The Microsoft team was immensely effective in mentoring us and helping guide us to reach our goals; it\u2019s been a game changer for us and it\u2019s something we\u2019ll be sure to do in future hackathons. </p>\n<h2>What's next for STOCKASSIST</h2>\n<p>We\u2019d love to expand on every aspect of our app. This means we\u2019d love to include more and more social media outlets to better refine our data set, and thus use this to refine our machine learning algorithm as well. We also believe that this app would be effective across more platforms - from mobile to tablets to smart watches. If there\u2019s an influx of negative social media coverage for a particular company, having a mobile app ping our users would be highly effective in helping them save money in the stock market. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://stockassist.azurewebsites.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://stockassist.azurewebsites.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>stockassist.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://stockassist.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://stockassist.xyz\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>stockassist.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on machine learning (ML) though the Microsoft Azure package.

We hope that by using technology we can make response to these situations more effortlessly and reduce friction.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Our application aims to respond to every and all situations related danger; this includes sexual assault, armed robbery, terrorism, domestic abuse, arson, natural disasters. With the use of our application we allow victims a chance to instantly send out an SOS to the police and government; we also allow citizens to upload videos, photos, and audio of dangerous situations as they encounter them, creating essentially a hazard map that informs everybody around them of the danger.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Our solution can broken down into essentially two products: a web application and iOS application. For the average citizen our product aims to help quickly respond to disaster situations. Faced with danger a citizen can tap our widget on the lock screen without even opening the application allowing for instant contact with law enforcement. Additionally during times of national disaster, families can view loved ones through GPS location and know whether  are safe. Finally law enforcement can use either the mobile application or web application to monitor crime statistics, hot spots, and high problem areas.</p>\n<p>Here is a further break down of the three different categories to utilize our product; they are broken down as follows.</p>\n<h3>LAW ENFORCEMENT</h3>\n<p>Officers can find out the number of conflicts reported as well as the distance to the nearest conflict.\nThe number of officers is reported to determine the number of police to be allocated per crisis.\nCrisis mapping indicates what the most urgent crisis is so that the officers know which disaster to prioritize.</p>\n<h3>CIVILIANS</h3>\n<p>Civilian users can register based on their Government ID i.e. Driver's License or Social Security.\nInformation about nearby disasters and their categorizations is provided.\nSimple, intuitive widget on mobile phone allows civilians to send an SOS in times of danger.</p>\n<h3>FAMILIES</h3>\n<p>Users can verify the status of family members in a disaster. \nThe relative distance to the family member can be tracked to provide potential rescue options.\nEach user has his or her location mapped so family members know exactly where the disaster occurred.</p>\n<h2>Future/ Applications</h2>\n<p>This application was inspired by the recent attacks in Paris, but go much beyond that. It was built with the purpose of helping save lives and reduce daily calamities. This application works on the basis of immediate response and can therefore be applied to situations that require a natural disaster relief or situations of unrest in countries like in the Middle East.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/makefile\">makefile</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-maps\">bing-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/squarespace\">squarespace</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sketch3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">parse-node</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AkhilNadendla/Lighthouse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AkhilNadendla/Lighthouse\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on a majority of the front end iOS development.

As a result, we created Diver, a Virtual Reality experience designed to spread awareness about environmental pollution. We started with a simple list of hobbies- what would people want to experience in Virtual Reality? From there, we thought of how we could convert a simple game into a meaningful and immersive virtual experience, in a way that only Virtual Reality could manage. Through Diver, and Virtual Reality itself, we sought to bring attention to the severity of pollution while also allowing users to navigate an underwater, though polluted, environment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Diver is an underwater Virtual Reality experience, where the user is able to use Sixense Razer Hydras to swim and enjoy the beauty of underwater marine life (There's even a whale!), and the Oculus Rift to look around them. However, there's a catch: The ocean is filled with trash, and it's the player's job to swim around and clean up trash including cans and water bottles.</p>\n<p>Once the user has cleaned up enough trash, they will have \"won\" our game, but the message we want to send is much more profound. A message will display saying \"Congratulations! You beat our game! In reality, however, pollution occurs on a much greater scale...\" and at that point, pollution rains from above and throughly covers the ocean floor where the user is swimming.</p>\n<p>In this case, seeing is believing. It's one thing to hear about pollution- it's another to experience it around you. One person alone cannot solve the problem, and that problem is escalating quickly. This is the message we wanted to send through Diver, and the unfortunate reality we wanted to convey.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>To create Diver, we used the Unity Game Engine, the Oculus Rift, and the Sixense Razer Hydras. </p>\n<p>All actual game functionality was built inside Unity, including the scene itself. We wrote several scripts in C# to implement the actual user \"swimming\" and the random instantiation of trash in the scene. </p>\n<p>The Oculus Rift, arguably the most essential part of our message, brings Virtual Reality to the game engine and allows the user to become fully immersed in the experience. It provides 360 motion tracking, allowing anyone to look around them while in the scene completely hands free.</p>\n<p>The Razer Hydras, an input mechanism designed by Sixense, were used to map actual human hands into the scene. When the user holds the Hydras, they gain control of these hands, and can move in a 3D space to move the hands as well. Through this input mechanism, we were able to let the user \"swim\" around them, an action achieved by actually moving the hands while inside Virtual Reality.</p>\n<p>We obtained facts from kanat.jsc.vsc.edu/student/brookfield/mainpoints.htm and music, titled Perspectives, from <a href=\"http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300027\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1300027</a>. </p>\n<p>While the work on Diver was split amongst the three of us, we collaborate for opinions and to keep each other updated and aware on the progress of the part. Tasks were given based on who was capable of doing so. Several examples of collaborative tasks include working with the swimming simulation, designing the murky underwater fog, and music choice. Communication among the team was also important to ensure proper combination and building of the project in the end so that everyone's work gets successfully integrated.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was trying to work with the Razer Hydras to simulate swimming. The user, ideally, should be able to use the Razer Hydras to swim through the scene and collect trash. However, we had trouble deciding the best way to implement the action. We settled with using the Hydras to detect which direction the palms of the hands were facing and, by using the distance from the start of the movement to the end, allow the user to move in the direction opposite of where the hand is facing in a distance relative to how much distance your hands moved, as if they are \"pushing water\" and moving. Mapping actual swimming gestures and practices was unrealistic given our time frame, so the swimming in the game is more of a \"push away from the direction you want to move\", which sometimes takes a bit of getting used to.</p>\n<p>Distributing work was also tricky. However, we were able to get through by lots of communication and making sure each person was up to date with their task and no one was falling behind. There was a lot to do so each part and person were important.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Diver is a creation based on the desire to make a difference in the world. Though it is still, at it's core, a Virtual Reality game, it transcends that purpose and is far more of a message we want to send out across the world. We truly believed in the power of Diver to raise awareness and think that it has the potential to change perspectives for those who don't recognize the actual severity of pollution in the environment. Virtual Reality is still a very undeveloped field, and through our project, we are guiding it in a more positive and helpful direction.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Honestly, we were forced to face the realities of pollution ourselves. Through looking up facts and creating devastating scenes, we had to confront a reality that pollution is far worse than we expected, and essentially tried to convey the same shock we initially experienced.</p>\n<p>On a more technical note, we learned a lot about actual movement in Virtual Reality using the Razer Hydras, and about input mechanisms in general and the role they play in VR.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Diver</h2>\n<p>We want to expand the message that Diver sends. Rather than just presenting the user with an ultimate feeling of hopelessness as trash piles up, we want to show that, through collaboration, the problem can be solved. First, we want to clean up what we have, and improve the actual quality of experience and make it more understandable for the general public. From there, we want to integrate ways and show the user that they can make a difference if everyone pitches in.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">virtual-reality</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">razer-hydras</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows\">windows</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["ShowFinder", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZLE14s5pGE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShowFinder \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/379/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShowFinder \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/381/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>An opportunity to work on a various brand new platforms.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The application on Echo uses TicketMaster APIs to find the events in the city with the details and with consent of the user, it also books an Uber for the user through Uber APIs.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The application uses Alexa Skillset to train the Echo and convert the text to speech and vice-versa.

The database is a noSQL, fully managed and scaleable dynamo db. To ensure minimal latency we don't edit the database directly. We can AWS lambda functions, which pretty gives us a on demand server to run whatever code we need. We used google cloud messaging for push notifications to users. Of course we use google maps and markers to display the play date points. As a team, of course we realize we could not implement everything we wanted.

We realized how tedious it is to browse through postings in Excel of hackers posting their technical expertise and skills. In fact, they all end up looking roughly the same over time. WeHack simplifies the entire process of finding teammates based on desired skills, and exploring teams to better understand the project idea, including skills they're currently looking for as well as how many spaces are open. In addition, there's a bulletin board for the hackathon admin to continuously update, all with locations that make it easy for attendees to pinpoint exactly where the event or food is. This proves to be particularly useful since most attendees are new to the school and unfamiliar with its layout.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WeHack serves as a platform for teams to browse students who are looking for teams. They can search for specific skills, making it much more easier than ever before to find attendees with the exact skills they're looking for. In addition, attendees can view teams, their project idea, as well as the tech stack for the project. The admin of the hackathon event can continuously add bulletin posts with the latest news and updates, all with location included (that open in maps) that make it easy for attendees to find exactly where the event is going on. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built this with Swift for the iOS application, and node.js with MongoDB for the back-end REST API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were several challenges we ran into throughout the process of developing this application. The main one was developing a fully polished iOS app that adheres to Apple's UI/UX guidelines within the timeframe of this hackathon. While we got much of the application working, there is definitely more work to be done.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of developing an iOS application that resolves a real-world problem for hackathon attendees. We placed UI/UX design as one of our priorities as this application seeks to be the information hub for hackathons. We completed read through and understood Apple's design guidelines, and each every button, gesture, and style is optimized for ease of use for the user. We really believe that this application can change the way that people attend hackathons in the future, resolving many of the common pain-points from earlier.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>To make a fully robust iOS application, it definitely takes more than 1-2 nights. We also learned how to build robust APIs in Node.js and the sheer amount of work it takes to develop a UI/UX friendly application that optimizes the user's ease of use.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WeHack</h2>\n<p>We need to fully implement some of the features we set for the roadmap of our product, such as the admin options and messaging. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spencerprescott/WeHack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spencerprescott/WeHack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vishnukarthikl/hacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/vishnukarthikl/hacker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the wireframes, user flow, navigation, UI, UI kit, clickable prototype so everything UX and design related.

So at any given moment you will have someone you are trying to find before someone else finds you. This game has been the subject of large events over the years and has many variations to its name but never has there been an app to help facilitate it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app will allow for players to choose to join ongoing games or create games of their own. Once the player joins, they are automatically assigned a player to find on their smartphone along with a radar pointing to were they are in the predetermined boundaries. They will then have to navigate their way through their campus, city or neighborhood and try to locate their target. Once located the user will have the chance to tag their target by swiping up on their face on the app and send a notification to the target that they've been tagged. The player then earns points and can then carry on with their next target while their tagged target must report to a \"respawn zone\" to continue with their game.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used swift to code the front-end which currently consists of a map that will follow the user on the map as they walk towards the preset pin on the map. Once the user is close enough, they have the option of clicking the tag button and send a notification to themselves that they've tagged the target.

Thankfully, we do have other options like Uber or Lyft which enable us to commute effectively. But unfortunately, it can still get expensive for everyday commutes. So we decided to work on creating a system that provides a cheap as well as consistent solution to this problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>RideOut is a ride sharing application that allows people to pool cars to go from one point to another. It is different from other car pooling or cab applications out there in the sense that it takes into account driver's priorities - drivers post their ride as per their itinerary. </p>\n<p>For example a person X wants to go shopping from his home and return. X can reduce his/her fuel cost by picking up maybe a couple of people on his way who are also looking to go for a similar errand. As a result, the price is considerably lower than other cabs. The riders benefit from this model since they get a similar ride at deflated price. </p>\n<p>People who wish to commute between places can look up for available drivers who have planned their journey on a similar route.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We created an iOS application to showcase our MVP. Coding was done in Swift to speed up development. Back-end was hosted with Parse for the time being. We used Google Maps APIs to carry out all travel and map operations.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Drivers can post rides from source S to destination D with several additional points (way-points) in between. With huge number of drivers posting, this creates a graph of available stops (nodes) and paths (edges). Now the challenge is to provide all possible paths when a rider searches for a ride from source S\u2019 to destination D\u2019. There can be multiple paths using those intermediate way-points which can be tough to find since the Google Maps API returns only points in path A to B (it doesn\u2019t consider all points around its near proximity). But our application should provide all such paths.</p>\n<p>Since time was a constraint, we designed an algorithm which finds rides which uses all such way-points in a x mile radius from source and destination only. But it can be extended in future to use all such 1 mile radius way-points along the entire path (not just source and destination).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>With the time constraint, we are happy to create a close MVP for a ride-sharing app which incorporates a custom routing algorithm as per the novel idea of making the app driver centric and yet keeping the cost cheap for the riders.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt to use Google Maps APIs better than ever before since we never needed to explore the API to the edge. There was this great real world graph problems which further strengthened our knowledge of the most interesting and effective field of Computer Science.</p>\n<h2>What's next for RideOut</h2>\n<p>We wish to provide every transit method for a person who is planning to go from A to B.

Usually, alarm clock apps are unsuccessful at waking people up after a certain time duration of being used (anywhere from a few days to a few months), since users become accustomed to the app's method of waking them up. We decided to develop an alarm clock that makes it difficult to develop muscle memory for, forcing its users to wake up upon the app's activation in the morning.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app begins by implementing a simple clock that can be scrolled through to set an alarm (in either hours or minutes). Once the alarm goes off, the app prompts the user to get out of bed and dance around until the accelerometer has been sufficiently activated for a certain time duration. The app cleverly prevents users from throwing the phone by forcing users to constantly be pressing a button on the screen in order to have the phone's movements recorded. Finally, after passing the physical movement stage, users are given a fun fifteen-slider puzzle to solve in order to wake up the cerebellum. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Although on Friday night, at the beginning of the hackathon, none of our three members had ever developed an iOS application, we learned the basics of Swift and Objective-C to utilize Apple's developer platform, Xcode, and create this app. We specifically utilized the CoreMotion software in order to activate the accelerometer. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some difficulties making our code effective while switching between Swift and Objective-C. Additionally, integration of the different parts of our code was a time-consuming endeavor. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of the fact that we were quickly able to learn new coding languages and create our very first games and first mobile applications. We also spent a significant amount of time making sure the app was user-intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to code in Swift and Objective-C. Additionally, we learned the importance of teamwork and beginning with a simple and intuitive design. We also discovered the potent power of Red Bull. </p>\n<h2>What's next for WideAwake</h2>\n<p>We hope to finish developing the app and making sure to fix any bugs we may find. We also hope to add a randomized variety of alarm sounds and puzzles in order to continue our goal of developing an alarm that counteracts muscle memory. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">paper</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">coremotion</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">audiotoolkit</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://goo.gl/wtNaC2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://goo.gl/wtNaC2\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>goo.gl</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Localization Launcher", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Localization Launcher \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/323/004/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I decided I wanted to design a video game for my Graphic Design class, and I haven't planned to develop it, but I took this opportunity to develop a prototype of the game.

The application uses machine learning optical structure recognition technology to identify up to 9 different structures from a user generated handwritten image. Within the app, the user hand draws a structure which is then sent to the machine learning algorithm to be processed, and is returned as a typeset image.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>ChemType uses a machine learning algorithm called a neural network classifier for optical structure recognition. To generate training examples, we hand drew 40 diagrams of each structure with pen and paper. Because we had such few training examples, great care was taken to ensure high training data quality by preprocessing the images. Dimensionality reduction, reducing each image from millions of dimensions to only 96 dimensions, allowed the neural network to focus on the broad structural features of the molecule. Additionally, we applied a background correction to denoise the images. We then developed and tested the neural network using Microsoft Azure Machine Learning and used Azure's web service to transfer raw data and results to and from our iPad app. The main job of the app was to get the user generated image and send it to Azure, then collect the result of the neural network algorithm from Azure and give the user the corresponding image.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ChemType</h2>\n<p>With more training data ChemType can eventually be able to recognize hundreds of structures. Adding further machine learning algorithms will allow the app to recognize structures it has never been taught before by recognizing their chemical functional groups, as well as recognizing text. Because all the heavy-duty computation is loaded on the cloud, the app has a great potential to be scaled up without putting a burden on iOS or the user's local machine. With the right algorithm, ChemType could make chemistry note taking entirely digital, completely bypassing the need for conventional molecule editing software.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WbT8S-9hucZSAftC-JUzNY9YbbP2ceBcGKWBkEsvjsY/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.p8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WbT8S-9hucZSAftC-JUzNY9YbbP2ceBcGKWBkEsvjsY/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.p8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on some of the iOS components of the application, including image processing, and communication with the Azure web service (sending input data, and parsing JSON data) that uses Azure Machine Learning to return a matching chemical compound.

This is the shortcomings of the blind spots that exist in all cars, however we as engineers will not stand by and let this happen to others. About 18,000 injuries and 300 deaths happen every year due to visibility issues with blind spots in the United States. We wanted to create something that mitigates this issue.  </p>\n<p><strong>## What it does</strong>\nSafeGuard is a portable module that reports any collision incident anywhere. It is a cloud connected blackbox that constantly saves sensor data. A built in rangefinder detects for close by objects, along with other sensors for additional data. For example, the weather shield can be attached to retrieve Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, etc. of a certain location during the time of incidence. </p>\n<p>It can be used in multiple different industries from simple home care to factory automation. Today we have used the SafeGuard module to give a normal car luxury options, such as a backup range detector, an HUD with frontal range, and a blind spot monitoring system. </p>\n<p><strong>## How we built it</strong>\nWe use a Photon Board connected to Azure for saving data. This was after using a couple other boards including the Arduino and Spark Cores. An LED matrix shows how close any object gets within 4ft. Additional i/o devices such as weather shields and speakers can be added. </p>\n<p><strong>## Challenges we ran into</strong>\nAt first we wanted to create a blind spot detector with the Arduino and turn on an LED, but then realized the value proposition of creating an IoT device connected to the cloud. The WiFi shield proved difficult for us, making us explore different option with the Photon and Spark Cores. As a team we came into this hackathon wanting to make something big and grand, but soon realized a valuable lesson: A small thing that solves a big problem is much more valuable than a big thing that solves a small problem. </p>\n<p><strong>## Accomplishments that we are proud of</strong>\nThis is our first hardware hack at a hackathon. We are all software people so learning hardware was definitely new for us. We created a pretty awesome cardboard model of our car named Speedy. Be sure to check us out! </p>\n<p><strong>## What we learned</strong>\nHow to use and Arduino, Spark Cores, Node Js, JSON packets, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Kinect, and Android. \nSmall things that solve big problems are much more important than big things that solve small problems. </p>\n<p><strong>## What's next for SafeGuard</strong>\nSafeGuard is just the beginning of IoT data retrieval. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photon</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cardboard</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ductape</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hud</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Picture This!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Picture This</h2>\n<p><em>Debut @ hackSC2015</em></p>\n<p>Play the most exciting new game!

USC itself recognized this issue last year, and hosted a competition to ameliorate the scheduling mess.

We wished to come up with an app that was spontaneous and had the capability to go viral. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Imagine you are going around USC you see the band tailgating the football team and you like what they are playing. You just take out your mobile phone, open voices and cast this audio byte. Voices limits audio bytes to unto 90 seconds. When you cast out your audio byte, you will have to choose a radius upto which this byte is to be cast to. We know the exact coordinates of where this stream was recorded. The user can optionally add a 50 character text message to describe what the audio byte is about (eg) #USC #Tailgate #USCvUCLA. \nOnce you cast this audio byte into the platform there is no talking it back, it's for everyone to listen to.</p>\n<p>When I login to the web-application or mobile application I will be able to see the streams around me on a map. The streams are marked by colors from dark red to red based on their popularity. Hovering on these streams would given me meta information about byte. Clicking on it would play the byte. I will be able to 'like' the byte or 'comment' on it as well.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>These audio bytes are subjected to a temperature metric. Bytes created by popular users will be 'hotter'. We assign an absolute value of hotness to the byte once it's created. As more users start listening to it, liking it or commenting on it we increase the temperature of the stream by linear amounts. If a stream remains inactive for a long time their temperatures start to drop exponentially over time. With inspiration from 'exponential-decay' of radio-active elements and applying to this problem we came up with an efficient metric to gauge the effective popularity of bytes.\nWe set a lower bound threshold on the hotness when we query bytes. We used simple mysql spatial queries to fetch bytes around a location with their specified radius.</p>\n<p>We built a RAILS API server on top of a MYSQL database. The API server provides well defined HTTP api calls for login, byte creation, listing bytes around a location in a paginated fashion, to comment on streams, like streams (etc). The web / mobile apps interact with this API server based on these defined APIs and interface with the user. The web application was a front end SPA with angular-js. We were also working on android and IOS applications.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We set out to build an API backend, a web-app, an android app and an IOS app. We failed miserably in managing our time. I think we over-engineered the product and started thinking outside the confines of presenting this product at the end of the a hackathon which caused us a lot of time. (eg) I like to TDD, so I spent a lot of time writing tests for the API backend code. We were only able to build a functional API server. All the other three of our front ends are a work in progress. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I believe that this is a great idea. If engineered to scale and built with a nice funky feel to it, I believe this app can go viral.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I personally gained a lot of experience from this project as a leader. Right from convincing my team mates that this is an Idea worth investing their time in, to defusing conflicts, taking calls on feasibility. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Voices</h2>\n<p>This is just the beginning. Over the next one month we are hoping to spend time on this and engineer it right and build it to scale. We are looking to do a soft launch around USC.</p>\n<p>As a longterm vision, I see a lot of scope for Voices in terms of a tool to gauge the sentiment of people around a specific region on various topics. I believe this has tremendous value much more than a service like twitter because we get much more insight from audio data. With the learning technologies available at hand and with considerable data this platform will help gauge sentiments of people much more accurately.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nithinkrishna/voices-api\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nithinkrishna/voices-api\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nithinkrishna/voices-android\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nithinkrishna/voices-android\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nithinkrishna/voices-web-app\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nithinkrishna/voices-web-app\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["ALRM-Kill", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALRM-Kill \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/012/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALRM-Kill \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/011/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALRM-Kill \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/013/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALRM-Kill \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/010/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We've all had a roommate who <strong>always</strong> sets an alarm that goes off in the earliest hours of the morning, which pulls you out of your deepest slumber, leaving you wide awake while he/she continues to sleep through it.

By emotionally pleasant, I mean routes that are more scenic, quieter or have some kind of interesting attractions for users like restaurants, tourist places, etc. The current mapping services do not provide this feature. It can be very useful when planning tours.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The project suggests alternative pleasant routes in New York City that would be only reasonably longer than the most optimal routes. For this, we use the opinions/emotions left behind by people about the different places on social networking platforms like Foursquare. When visiting a place, people have a tendency to share their experience or leave behind a review about the place on Foursquare. As this social networking site allows geo-tagging, we can use this data to know the general sentiment of the people about the place. This sentiment score can then be used in identifying pleasant routes to a destination.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>My approach to this problem can be summarized into three main steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Create a graph with nodes as the places on the map. Geographically neighboring places are connected by an edge in the graph. The edges represent the geographical distance between the places. For this project I considered New York City.</p></li>\n<li><p>Then extract posts from Twitter and Foursquare with places tagged in them. Using Sentiment Analysis, we get the opinion of people about the place. Then update the graph we created in step 1 with the sentiment score. We do this for all the places/nodes in our graph. Finally we have a graph with each node having a corresponding sentiment score.</p></li>\n<li><p>Now, when a user enters his destination, we find the route to the destination using the graph that we created. For this, we use the path finding algorithms. We find the different routes, each having two scores assigned to them\u00ad-Distance and Sentiment. We then find the best possible route, one that is not too long than the shortest one, but has more positive sentiment to it, signifying more emotional pleasantness.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Dividing the city of New York in blocks of 1km square are geographically required use of latitudes and longitudes. Understanding the Foursquare API was tough at start. Also, path finding algorithms like Yen's K shortest paths algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm was a challenge to implement, especially because the graph size was huge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Successfully leveraged the vast potential of the data on social networking sites to improve the mapping features. Sentiment Analysis of this data provides valuable insights about different places in a city, which I have used to find an emotionally pleasant route. This feature in a mapping service is bound to make our trips a lot more exciting!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Using Foursquare API. Also, several Graph Algorithms like Yen's Algorithm.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Route to Happiness</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Adding this feature to the mapping services like Google Maps, Apple Maps</li>\n<li>Using the data from other social networking sites like Twitter, Flicker etc.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stanford-nlp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/foursquare\">foursquare</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ajinkya13/Route-to-Happiness\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ajinkya13/Route-to-Happiness\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://prezi.com/xavgtdzex8np/route-to-happiness/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://prezi.com/xavgtdzex8np/route-to-happiness/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>prezi.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Charlie", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Charlie \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/323/044/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I am Charlie.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nuance\">nuance</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">speechkit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ai</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ingochris/Charlie\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ingochris/Charlie\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end of the project.

After some thinking of what can we do with that data, we figured an interesting solution to a serious problem. Apply the data to solve the problems of <strong>screen readers</strong> that <strong>visually impaired</strong> people use.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There are two parts to the project:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We present the users with a game that scores them based on their accuracy of typing. The players get a score, the time they took and the mistakes they made. The sentences contain markers around the words that have emphasis. After playing for a while, the player gets accustomed and learns where to place markers. Then we start providing plain sentences and users add emphasis markers.</li>\n<li>We use this data to build a machine learning model. To create the initial model, we give the players pre-marked sentences to mark. Using their markings, we generate a model to build their profile. For eg players marking plain sentences correctly will receive much higher XP as compared what they would get playing just the typing game. These profiles will be used to predict which is the correctly emphasized sentence. The correct sentence will be provided to a text to speech service that understands the emphasis markers and produce a prosodically pleasing speech.\nThe screen reader service is hosted on Azure Cloud. It takes the .wav files and the correctly emphasised sentence and sends the .wav file as the output of TTS.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The mobile app is developed for iOS using XCode and Swift. \nThe initial, unmarked sentences provided to the players are manually marked to generate a classification model using perceptron. Now the players are provided with completely unknown sentences and using the model we classify the marked sentences into correct or incorrect.\nThe correct sentences are provided to a TTS service that analyzes the emphasis marks and generates a .wav file which is later used on the online screen reader.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>iOS development was really new to our teammates. Getting a good TTS service that incorporates prosody was challenging, Microsoft mentor Tim really helped with this.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Finishing a working model of the product, integrating various services</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Technical skills: iOS, Azure Web deployment.\nPlanning really helps as does taking breaks.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fastype: Play for humanity</h2>\n<p>Improve the machine learning model, get more data, introduce new levels in the game, make it multiplayer, possibility of monetization by providing the audio to various audio books developers</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/net\">.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-10\">windows-10</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Password Saver", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Voice Recognision project</h1>\n<h2>Members of the Research Group:</h2>\n<p><strong>Member #1:</strong> Oceane Bel</p>\n<p><strong>Member #2:</strong> Kenneth Chang</p>\n<p>BEFORE YOU RUN ANYTHING!
