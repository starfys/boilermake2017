Research suggests everything from several mini power-naps a day to giving up alarm clocks to shifting the school day later. Falling asleep is hard, but staying awake is harder. When you\u2019re on a deadline and down to the wire, sleep is often the first thing to go. When you pulled a double shift and are driving home at zero-dark-thirty, you can\u2019t afford to doze off. If you\u2019re waiting up late for a roommate or family member, you don\u2019t want to pass out. There are so many times when you prioritize consciousness and productivity over the bags under your eyes. Caffeine or loud music can help, but are not always affective and generally disruptive. We want to let you <strong>sleep on your terms</strong>: only when you choose.</p>\n<h2>What is Jolt?</h2>\n<p>Jolt is an IOS app, written in Swift, that collects data from the Microsoft Band, a wearable fitness tracker. By analyzing data on the wearer\u2019s motion and heart rate, Jolt is able to predict when you\u2019re close to dozing off. It notifies you with a haptic notification, which can be turned off on both a phone and the Band itself. There are low and high priority settings that represent different intensities. If a user is driving, they cannot dose off for even a moment, and can utilize the high priority setting that will buzz them fully awake when they have not yet fallen asleep. Low priority is better suited for students or workers, who can accept getting closer to dozing off if that means fewer interruptions.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>With a lot of help from Stackoverflow. </p>\n<h2>How We Did It</h2>\n<p>The main technical challenge was calculating sleep onset. We skimmed a lot of papers that all had different biological markers for when a person actually falls asleep. We experimented for most of the night--hackers make ideal test subjects--to figure out a trigger that wasn't too conservative or frequent. We ended up with a complicated set of constraints. We first determine if the gyroscope has moved recently, and if it hasn't, the first test has passed. Then we examine current heart rate against the <em>average</em> value. This average is frequently refreshed with small sample sizes, but only when the subject is moving. We found that if we factored in \"still\" heart rates, the average came too close to the sleeping rate. We also added a <em>sloth</em> factor. If the user doesn't move for an extended period of time, the criteria for sleeping heart rate slowly rises. This is best suited for athletes, who's heart rate's don't change nearly as much upon sleep onset. In their case, even if their heart rate doesn't drop below the appropriate percent, the percentage keeps increasing. This <em>sloth</em> factor is reset if the user moves again.\n<strong>tl;dr:</strong> If the user's heart rate drops too far, we wake them up. If he or she stays still for a long time, we prompt them to move.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Faced</h2>\n<p>We came to Dartmouth thinking that we'd use the Apple Watch as our wearable-of-choice. We'd never developed with it before, and had borrowed a couple from friends to test out. We struggled for about five hours before we figured out that the Watch couldn't do what we wanted. Despite having the sensors we needed, we couldn't access heart rate data when the phone was off, making it unusable for monitoring. We switched over to the Microsoft Band--another wearable we weren't used to--and went for it. Thankfully, we were able to access sensor data and the documentation was very thorough. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>Our team came into this hackathon with a huge range of experience and skills. For two of us, this is our first hackathon. That alone is something we are proud of. But we each picked up some new skills. Alex learned how to write Swift. Claire learned how to mock up a UI. Lee developed with wearables for the first time. We are better and badder than we were a day ago, and that's pretty cool. </p>\n<h2>Looking Forward</h2>\n<p>Jolt works pretty well, but we\u2019re not done yet. In the future we\u2019d like to expand Jolt\u2019s functionality to incorporate a skin temperature analysis, which would improve our accuracy. We\u2019d also like to create an Android version of the app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">heart-rate</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gyroscope</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ldanilek/Jolt2.git \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ldanilek/Jolt2.git \">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend for the app, in Swift.

It uses the Azure Machine Learning API's to extract relevant keywords from the current page, and the Bing news API to draw other news articles from around the web related to your topic. For context regarding the topic, it parses Wikipedia and returns a brief summary of the topic.

We hence could not acquire it without at least a day of downloading.</p>\n<p>So we had to shift our project and make it more generalized, utilizing more tools from around the web to do this rather than just Reddit.

With a quick shake, the 2 students are able to immediately schedule a meal together to catch up. Let\u2019s GAM makes that meal a reality. Users are able to register and login with Facebook. When users encounter each other and want to schedule a meal while meeting on the go, they simply just shake their phones at the same time and Let\u2019s GAM will automatically look at the two parties\u2019 calendars to schedule a meal during their next common availability. No need to pull out their calendars and guess and check availabilities. Let\u2019s GAM does it instantaneously. Meals are organized chronologically and are automatically scheduled into both users\u2019 calendars. By setting a date and time on their smartphones , students will be more likely to meet. There\u2019s also the function that allows users to click on scheduled meals on the app to start chatting via Facebook Messenger to talk logistics before the meal. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built the app with android.

Maybe you are a good samaritan who likes to help others with small tasks, but don't know where or who needs help. This application seeks to bring together those who request help and those who are willing to give it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's the middle of winter; you are sick in the River Cluster dying for a cup of hot tea. You mark your position on Together App with the label \"Sick in the River; Can someone please please please bring me a cup of tea?\" By the magic of human kindness a fellow student brings you what you most hope for to ease your illness. This is what Together brings.\nUsers can log in to the application to do one of two things: see what posts for assistance there are for people who are nearby, or post a message to request assistance. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed the entire app in Android Studio. We used Parse for back end services and Google Maps for location services.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The google maps and parse APIs were both unintuitive to use. Synchronous development of using different APIs created problems in merging dependencies.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Integrating multiple API's into a final working app. Creating an app that promotes social good.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Using multiple SDK's takes substantial effort to make them work while also screening out redundant dependencies.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Together</h2>\n<p>A more robust and fluid user interface. A more interesting point system. Real time global rankings.

For us, it is difficult to acclimatize and find events we may be interested in. Aside from the publicly announced club events, there is a whole new region of fun, informal events. Organizing and publicizing spontaneous events was a hassle - until now.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Darthub is meant to offer students a way to connect with each other to participate in casual events such as pickup sports games, late-night food runs, or watching a movie. This eliminates the need for mass emails and makes sure no one misses out. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>All the front-end of the website was built by Michael with HTML and CSS. It was all built from scratch, which is impressive to say the least. The backend was worked on by the rest of the team. We decided to go with Parse because it would allow us to deal with minimal backend coding. The Android app was completely designed and created using Parse as a backend by Agastya. Seb created the layout for the IOS app as well and helped with coding and debugging the backend. Nathan did a large part of integrating Parse with the website.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the large challenges was making sure all of our parts fit together. We really had to work as a team to integrate the frontend seamlessly with the backend and also to have the android and website use the same database. Additionally, for some of the errors we had with our website, the error would only appear on certain computers, while other computers worked fine. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I have to say bringing everything together was the proudest accomplishment. Seeing the gorgeous frontend mesh with the backend code in such a small amount of time, as well as see the Android app come to life will remain a proud moment for our entire team. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned massive amounts about Parse and how to integrate it across IOS, Android, and websites, using Javascript, Swift and Java.</p>\n<h2>What's next for darthub</h2>\n<p>What our team would love to see happen with darthub is just for the community at Dartmouth to use it. We would love, in the future, to continue to expand our idea to other schools and wherever people want to create pickup-games or other relaxed activities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://darthub.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://darthub.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>darthub.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the back end using Parse and developed all back end/front end integration.

Using Apple's multiplayer connectivity, users can play against friends and those nearby in a classic game of tic-tac-toe, or as we like to call the improved version, On The Go Tic-Tac-Toe, which represents the first milestone in creating an offline library of multiplayer games without wifi or the use of cellular data. The iOS application allows for gameplay features that is complemented with an online web-client.\n      Originally, we planned to use image recognition to identify hand-drawn tic-tac-toe boards, but due to software limitations, we had to postpone the release of this feature.\n      On the Go Tic-Tac-Toe was developed with Swift and JSON for iOS, with extensive use of Apple's Multiplayer Connectivity Framework. With this framework, users are able to connect to other players through a bluetooth P2P Mesh Network. The web-client was built using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing for flawless gameplay on any device. Efficient coding of the web animations and the AI in the applications were a challenge that the team had to over come, with the group also spending time focusing on the design and UX of both types of the application. The team is proud of their use of Apple's Multipeer Connectivity Framework and hopes to extend this concept with other games and applications in the future. \n</code></pre>\n<p>HackDartmouth II was our first Hackathon, and we can't wait to continue learning!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ishaanprasad.com/TTT/indexTTT.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ishaanprasad.com/TTT/indexTTT.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.ishaanprasad.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tgen4qz9209gl6o/AACKV9GDpSiBhXbQ1rwfVc2ma?oref=e&amp;n=104096943\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tgen4qz9209gl6o/AACKV9GDpSiBhXbQ1rwfVc2ma?oref=e&amp;n=104096943\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the web client and front-end that accompanied the app."]], ["BioAlarm", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BioAlarm \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/298/999/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>BioAlarm is an application for the Microsoft's Wristband.

This ensures that users are fresh and revitalised when they wake up. The overall practice of waking up in Non-REM sleep is also very beneficial to ones health. \nWith a function of time we can improve the software such that it tracks your sleep history and allows us to determine which are the times you either move out of deep sleep or are on the verge of moving into deep sleep. This allows us to find the most suitable time to start getting you out of REM or keeping in non-REM. </p>\n<p>We utilise swift to build a simple alarm application which syncs with the Microsoft WristBand. The band starts a low frequency and low intensity vibrations minutes before the set alarm - pushing the user out of REM. When the Alarm, actually, goes off then the band has a high-frequency and high intensity vibrations coupled with the phone alarm going off at the same time. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/indigothm/SmartAlarm4MicrosoftBand\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/indigothm/SmartAlarm4MicrosoftBand\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["POLI TILT", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"POLI TILT \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/298/946/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>POLI TILT</h1>\n<p>Article Analysis for the politically inebriated.</p>\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Maxwell Renke - <a href=\"mailto:maxrenke@gmail.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">maxrenke@gmail.com</a></li>\n<li>Ryan Bowring - <a href=\"mailto:rwb1005@wildcats.unh.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">rwb1005@wildcats.unh.edu</a></li>\n<li>Warren Edgar - <a href=\"mailto:wew6@wildcats.unh.edu\" rel=\"nofollow\">wew6@wildcats.unh.edu</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>POLI TILT is a Chrome Web Extension that is powered by the Indico political analysis API to determine the bias of a political news article.

You may have heard of d3.js? Have you heard of c3.js? They're web graphing libraries that help us make sense of online data. </p>\n<p>Web graph libraries combine the accessibility of the Internet and providing easy to understand visualizations for datasets! But they are typically 2D perspectives. What about graphs that rely on three variables?  What about 3D? I created b3.js as an open source library to allow users to create 3D graphs on their web application that are manipulatable with the Oculus and Leap Motion.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>b3.js allows users to create 3D graphs made of WebGL and three.js objects. Users wear an Oculus Rift to see first hand the 3D floating graph within the web browser. You can use the Leap Motion to manipulate any point of the graph and move points around to see changes live. b3.js is d3.js for 3D, VR, and hand interfaces!</p>\n<p>Create 3D graphs as easily as d3.js but perceive a 3D perspective of graphs that rely on the third dimension. Think 3D Scatter Plots and 3D Grid Plots!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>b3.js depends on WebVR. Chromium has a VR build that supports the Oculus Rift. I created library calls within b3.js to call on the resources of WebGL and Three.js  to create the graphs and points in 3D space. I also used the two to create the empty white environment that a user will appear while wearing the Oculus Rift.</p>\n<h2>What's next for b3.js</h2>\n<p>Develop and sustain!\n<a href=\"https://github.com/huyle333/b3\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/huyle333/b3</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webgl\">webgl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">leap.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://b3js.azurewebsites.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://b3js.azurewebsites.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>b3js.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/huyle333/b3\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/huyle333/b3\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]]]
