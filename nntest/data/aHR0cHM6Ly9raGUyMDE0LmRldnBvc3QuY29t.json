When I learned about the Xposed Framework, which allows you to inject your code or replace it at the level of methods in Java, I had to try it. I successfully implemented an idea I had to control whether Android consumes alt-tab events or lets apps handle them, and this is <a href=\"http://repo.xposed.info/module/com.appsofawesome.keyboardutilities\" rel=\"nofollow\">now published</a>. However, as I tried to tackle more difficult problems that dealt more with closed source OEM code, I realized that the hardest part was actually just knowing exactly where to modify to get the desired effect. I tried some educated guessing and some trial and error, and while I had some success, there was just simply too much probing to do for a person. </p>\n<p>At that point, I realized that I already had all the tools to write a program that could do exactly that. Using Java Reflection and the Xposed Framework, I could find not only the class hierarchy information easily obtained by partial decompliation tools, but also determine which control flow paths are actually executed at runtime, something impossible to predict based on only a class heirarchy and method names. </p>\n<p>This is achieved by traversing the various classes, methods, and other elements, and whenever a method was encountered, adding a hook to it that called my code before the method's original code. Then, each time the method was called, I could obtain a stack trace and see exactly where the methods had been called from. Since Xposed modules often must work by changing behavior at the first possible opportunity, or at the last, this information is invaluable, and impossible to predict without runtime information. </p>\n<p>This tool does not do everything at once, because that is impossible, but it gives an excellent start and could be easily modified by the developers who would be using it to suit their purposes. I know that I already plan to further customize this tool and use it for my future development. I hope that others find it as useful. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adt\">adt</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xposed</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["seesaw", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"seesaw \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/398/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"seesaw \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/399/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"seesaw \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/400/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"seesaw \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/401/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>\"Imagine you're the first person ever climbing Mount Fiction.

When you reach the summit the second time, the seesaw app is now packed full of people celebrating reaching the top.

Once a user has left their post or \"footprint\", it is attached to a geographic point on a map and is only visible by other users that are around that same area.  Users can comment on other footprints around them, but once they have left the area with the footprint, they can no longer view it, that is until they return to that area.</p>\n<p>seesaw provides local communities with a new way to share with each other and promote new discovery in a familiar, Geocaching like atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Get out there and leave your footprint!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/imgur\">imgur</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["composr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"composr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/387/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>composr simplifies the process of converting the melodies in your head to music via singing, an instrument, whistling, or humming.

But when we got here and talked to Todd Packer and saw his passion behind his product, the Boogie Board Sync, we wanted to knoq more about it. When we got a Sync to try we were blown away by all of the possibilities it had to offer. We knew right then and there that we should switch ideas and work on that project for a classroom setting. I myself am going to college to become a technology teacher, so I thought about how well these could be implemented into a classroom setting to help boost the learning experience of today's youth. We saw the Sync as a tool that could be used for more reliable note taking that could easily replace the pen and paper within the next few years. Think about it: papers can't get lost with this, you never run out of paper, or even ink for that matter; it easy to organize all of your notes into projects or by class; and most importantly, teachers could send notes that they wrote to all of their students over Bluetooth or NFC.\n\n\n  Our target user would be students and schools, I see this as a highly valuable resource that is fairly inexpensive. Class sets of these systems sell for approximately $2,000, which is much cheaper than the same class equivalent of iPads or any other system that schools are looking to adopt. In fact, I see much greater potential in the Sync than an iPad: it's cheaper, more resilient, easy to use in any class, needs very little charging, and does not distract students in the classroom through games and apps. These can be an invaluable resource for students or any other learning environment.\n\n\n  We are very proud of the capabilities our program provides for teachers to mass share his/her notes over Bluetooth to all of their students, that way no ever has to fall behind in class again if they were sick or even just having a rough day. We also made it so that students can upload their work (Ex. homework, in class activities, pop quiz, notes) to their teacher.  In fact, we emailed a teacher and consulted with a school board member about their opinions regarding our program.  They were ecstatic to hear that these capabilities would exist, and looked forward to our progress, and gave us some ideas on how to implement and improve our program.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.net-framework-4.5</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/evernote\">evernote</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows\">windows</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["musicalPI", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"musicalPI \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/393/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"musicalPI \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/394/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Our software allows users to upload music to a Raspberry Pi via a simple website.

Using image targets, it displays a complete skeleton of the human hand.

In addition, you are able to select each individual bone in the hand and get its name and a brief description of the bone. This is significant because it can help patients understand their injury and also provide a basis for learning different parts of the human hand. This is very handy, especially for doctors who need to connect to their patients or teachers who need to connect to their students in a down to earth fashion.

Once a number of cans are collected, a compacter initiates and crushed the cans further down, making more room and an awesome spectacle for everyone. Every can has value when it is recycled. The program displays the number of cans collected and displays the price that the cans will receive when they go to the scrap centers.

The final Project will be a much smaller scale system meant for dorms or in a kitchen to crush 5-10 cans at a time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lcd</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Monkey Bizzness", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/364/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/365/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/366/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/367/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/368/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/369/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/370/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/371/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/372/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 10\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/373/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Monkey Bizzness \u2013 screenshot 11\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/374/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>With recent rulings and school crackdowns on Sexual Misconduct, leading to many allegations of rape, based on the new \"yes means yes\" rule, requiring a clear verbal or nonverbal agreement before engaging in a sexual activity.</p>\n<p>But how should this be approached? How would one prove that they initially said yes in a situation? How would one prove that the other party said they had no STD's or claimed to be of the right mind to make the decision? How do they prove that during the time, it was consensual or that it was not? </p>\n<p>That's where Monkey Bizzness comes into play. Monkey Bizzness is an app to protect both males and females, while getting them to be more vocal about what they want, and are okay with. Instead of a male assuming a situation is okay, they can get written consent stating it is, or have the woman state outright that she is not. Instead of assuming the partner is STD free, they can now have a document of them claiming whether or not they are, and have it for later use. This app protects both parties from potential harm, before the sexual activity happens, during the sexual activity, and after.</p>\n<p>So how does it work? To start, one of the parties involved creates an account with Monkey Bizzness and inputs some basic information. Their first/last name, their age, any STD's they currently have, email, among others. They then have the option to create a contract, which can be signed by both parties to ensure that they are protected. They fill out the form with their first/last names, age, STD's, birth control/contraception use, being of sound mind, and then finalize the form by signing it and taking a picture of themselves showing that it is all consensual. This data is then sent to our servers to be locked away and out of reach from the users until it is needed, ideally in a situation where one of the users has legal action taken against them. This ensures that their data is private, and cannot be shared with other people.</p>\n<p>Our typical target audience is College Students, but can be used for people of all legal ages. With situations now-a-days involving cases of false rape, lying about STD's, and California even discussing the potential of having it's citizens sign paper documents before consenting to having sexual relations, an app that does all this in a heartbeat only makes sense. That app is Monkey Bizzness.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["ElectroDJ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ElectroDJ \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/363/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I wanted to extend the range of devices on which my original Android app could be used.

Up until now, I never had a system that I could measure and keep track of how long projects took to complete. PunchIO is based around the idea of a digital time clock. It is easy to see when you started working on your project, when you stopped working on it, and for how long you worked on it using the streamlined interface. </p>\n<p>In order to see actual progress, I needed some way to track code that was done while the user is clocked into the project. Integration with GitHub allows me to do just that. I utilized GitHub's oAuth2 system in order to simplify the process, allowing users to link their GitHub account without exposing their credentials. After your GitHub is linked, you can assign your repositories to your PunchIO projects, and anytime you make a commit to that repository, GitHub lets us now so we can track it in the database as well. This way, when ever you make a commit while you are clocked in on a project, it will show up on the session page making it easy for you to later reference which commits were made during each session.</p>\n<p>As a developer, its still pretty standard to write things down on paper, but the problem is that paper gets lost, a lot. When working on my project, I found myself with a little bit of remaining time, so I decided to implement the Boogie Board into my project. Once you have clocked into your PunchIO project, you can begin drawing/taking notes on the Boogie Board Sync. When you are done, all you have to do is run the Java application, then plug in your Boogie Board via a micro-USB cable, and the syncing process happens automatically. The PDF files on the Boogie Board are all uploaded individually, and then combined into a single PDF file where they are attached to the session for later review.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">boogie-board</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">github-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">oauth2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mac\">mac</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/web\">web</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows\">windows</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://punchio.shdwlf.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://punchio.shdwlf.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>punchio.shdwlf.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Computer Arduino Serial Interface", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Computer Arduino Serial Interface \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/178/357/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Rapid prototyping with an Arduino is not so friendly, especially if you are testing electronics parts.  The Arduino IDE requires the programmer to rebuild and recompile for every test, which is time consuming.  Allowing the computer to control the I/O of the Arduino would circumvent this issue because it would allow real time manipulation of pins.  This means that the Arduino essentially has the power and resources of the computer manipulating it.  Some notable features an Arduino can now access with this interface are the internet, massive computation power, and more memory.  With a few transceivers, this interface could also have a huge impact on the feasibility of the Internet of Things.  Each device would't need its own wifi card to access the internet.  The host program would be run on the computer and serial data would be pushed to the transceiver through an Arduino, allowing the computer to address multiple Arduino's.  This interface could also be used to help children learn the basics of circuits and coding.  We have programmed a basic gui that allows a user to manipulate pins in real time; and since the interface is written in Java, it is multi-platform and makes it easy for other languages to access the Arduino.  Finally, this interface allows electronics testers to test circuits in real time on a low budget.  Serial forwarding is available to communicate with serial devices and a planned feature is a pin listener which will listen in on pins and plot out a real time graph of value with respect to time.  After this hackathon we plan to continue development.  Some features we plan to add in the future are gui support for all Arduino boards, a comprehensive API, and an easy system to integrate libraries written for Arduino.  A far goal would be to port the interface to mobile devices, specifically for teaching kids how to program and mobile electronics testing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jssc</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mac\">mac</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows\">windows</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/riggly/ArduinoIDE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/riggly/ArduinoIDE\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]]]
