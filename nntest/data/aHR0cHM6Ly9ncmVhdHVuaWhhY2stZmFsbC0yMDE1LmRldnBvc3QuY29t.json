There was much less time spent idle and more focused on the task in different areas at once.</p>\n<p>We are also very proud of being able to integrate the Steam API very successfully within the site and could access the immense numbers of games on the platform and all the achievements for each of them in order to create a compelling product which is also focused on social good!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned a lot about the use of external APIs and the use of OpenID to authenticate with external providers while not having to collect a lot of sensitive user information ourselves.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AchieveForGood</h2>\n<p>There is a huge amount of room for extra features and expansion on this project, from statistics on those who have donated to charity through the site or gained the most bounties from others to integration with game score leaderboards to challenge others based on specific values not limited to those in traditional achievements.</p>\n<p>However the most obvious next place to improve would be to implement caching for many of our API functions as this would drastically improve speed and responsiveness where calls are made to Steam servers.</p>\n<p>A system to place a hold on a payment method to guarantee payment from the challenger would also be useful for this project, as non-payment of bounties would be discouraging for users.</p>\n<p>Another great feature would be the ability to set time limits on when the achievement can be completed to prevent funds from being held up if the above was implemented and to add additional challenge.</p>\n<p>We anticipate that a very large market for this site would be for streamers as you can see the results of your challenge (usually the streamer's frustrations as to not being able to get the achievements!)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">just-giving-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">steam-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://46.101.29.75/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://46.101.29.75/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>46.101.29.75</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the back end PHP classes managing API queries and database access", "I worked on backend, server-side stuff mostly, along with some Steam Web API and Justgiving API integration research.

So the travel game challenge from WebApplications was the perfect opportunity for us to build upon these experiences and create a web application that solves the issue.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When opening the website, the user are greeted with a map of the surrounding area. On this map is a marker located at a point of interest that the user must get close to, after which a task is displayed which is about said point. There are \ntwo different types of tasks; photo tasks and question tasks. The photo tasks require the user to take a photo of the landmark that you have discovered and points are awarded for correct photos. The question tasks require the user to give the correct answer to a multiple-choice question with a potential point gain of 4. After the question is finished, the next marker is placed and the game continues.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The web application was built using JavaScript with the Google Maps and Clarifai APIs plus HTML and CSS for the web layout. The server is hosted using MAMP.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some trouble with the HTTP requests and API authorisation, but after much debugging we managed to solve the issues. We also had issues with CSS layout formatting, but managed to solve the problems within the time limit.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We believe that our web application provides a fun and encouraging way to go about sightseeing in a city and discovering new places. We are also proud of finishing the project even though we thought of the idea quite late on Saturday.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The two team members for who the GreatUniHack was their first hackathon learnt a lot about time-management, teamwork and about programming in general. We have also learnt a lot more about the city of Manchester though our app, as we were researching the city when creating questions for the application. We also learnt about using MAMP as the server hosting system.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TravelQuest</h2>\n<p>We would like to implement file uploading for the photo tasks, rather than just relying on image URLs, which is less useable. We would also like to add more question types, such as tasks where the user enters text themselves, rather than selection an answer from a selection of pre-defined choices. It would also be preferable if the future iterations of TravelQuest would allow users to upload their own tasks for others to complete, perhaps through the user of a MySQL database.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mamp</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SamTebbs33/GreatUniHack2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SamTebbs33/GreatUniHack2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the javascript front-end and the integration of the google maps api and the clarifai api.", "I did the research behind the project and contributed on the javascripy code for the map.", "Worked on the CSS/Bootstrap int. and helped Sam!", "I designed the logo for the app, contributed by researching the relevant locations in Manchester.

We reinvented an outdoor game... making it indoor. 404teamnotfound presents the brand new game that you've never seen before - basketball.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A lot of people enjoy playing basketball. But plenty of them don't have the opportunity to play. Probably it is always heavily raining outside, they don't have time to go to a proper court, or they can't manage it because of physical issues. Maybe they're just to lazy to meet with friends in real world. For these people in mind we created a multiplayer indoor basketball suite.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You can play basketball without leaving you room. An application on your android phone that you must place inside the basket tracks (using NFC tags) if you score. You can create games with anyone having the same setup, no matter where they are. Everything will be handled with our web app, the only things you need are a NFC compatible phone, a basket and an internet connection. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We divided our app in three parts: Android app, the server and the web app.\nThe Android app (built with Xamarin C#) allows a player to register their name and balls with our system, tracks when the ball is inside the basket (reading the unique string shared between the NFC tags attached to the ball) and sends this data to the server.\nThe server keeps track of users, their balls, scores and games they created, handling requests from the mobile app and the web app. The backend is written on Node.JS (with the help of express framework). Microsoft Azure was used as a hosting.\nThe web app allows players to create games (from 1 to 12 players!) and is used as a score table. The front end is done basically with Jade, JS (with some bit of jQuery) and Bootstrap framework.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Working with NFC tags on Android proved not to be as easy as we thought before. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have managed to create a new way of distant social interaction, solving some of the particular problems mentioned before, using cheap, easy to obtain equipment.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>All of us learned a lot of new stuff, because all of us took the part of work that we do not usually do.\nCris: usually works on the frontend; this time implemented the Node.JS backend.\nMikhail: usually works on backend and game logic; this time took upon the frontend (Jade, Bootstrap).\nDaymon: usually works on desktop apps; this time built the NFC reading Android app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for 2 Guys 2 Balls</h2>\n<p>Some more ball games that are usually played outdoors, using similar concepts. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xamarin-c#-(android)</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://2guys2balls.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://2guys2balls.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>2guys2balls.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dabar347/404TeamNotFound_guh_webapp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dabar347/404TeamNotFound_guh_webapp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dabar347/blue_team_of_death_greatunihack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dabar347/blue_team_of_death_greatunihack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Frontend (Jade, Bootstrap, JS, jQuery)", "I worked on the Android app, from server communication to GUI.

Including the use of the Justgiving api to get images and data regarding charities.</p>\n<p>Python + Flask for REST api allowing posting and getting of geolocation and donor metadata.</p>\n<p>We use Amazon web services to host our web frontend and backend.</p>\n<p>Tessel + Node.js for internet connected donation box which detects when users donate and uploads their geolocation and metadata to the ec2 server.</p>\n<p>Pebble + Pebble.js for smartwatch app allowing users to retrospectively register their donations.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Building a REST api to interface with our geolocation and metadata storage system using ec2.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Managing to integrate two hardware hacks within our project as well as integrate multiple api's including a custom REST api.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Javascript can be painful.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GeoDonation</h2>\n<p>Properly test the stack, integrate more features of the JustGiving api, add more data to redirect pages and incentives for users to register their donations retrospectively.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tessel\">tessel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/justgiving\">justgiving</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bedekelly/geodonation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bedekelly/geodonation\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked together with Bede Kelly to integrate Justgiving API.
