[["take charge.", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The solar industry is rapidly growing with Australia and around the world. An exciting platform for consumer engagement will help maximise the economic and environmental benefits associated with this technology. Inspiring competition through a simple economic performance index will enable consumers to better understand their energy behaviour, whilst providing a tool for effective demand-side management.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Take charge is an online community which ranks and educates everyday people based on their live and historical consumption and generation data. Through this, we have developed a tool for electricity-performance monitoring and a platform for competition. The service enables users to initiate \"challenges\" against other PV (solar) owners, with odds and stakes calculated for each match-up (available in real and virtual dollars). To maintain engagement and enable participation from individuals without PV, an algorithm has been developed which creates competitions between users over 24hr periods. This outside-in betting service liberates an underutilised asset - homeowners can make money simply by signing up. Both head-to-head and outside-in competitions reinforce positive energy behaviour, and everyone has access to customised information pages detailing the way in which they can use their electricity better, learning about solar and having fun while doing it. </p>\n<p>In the future, an established platform has enormous potential to help manipulate and manage home-owners use of electric vehicles and solar batteries. The index is based on time-of-use (peak, shoulder and off-peak), and rewards high generation and low consumption during periods of high grid-wide electricity demand. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using python, cgi, bootstrap, adobe illustrator and excel we have developed a simple and easy-to-understand user interface designed to promote ongoing engagement, with complex scoring, matching and ranking algorithms hidden in the back-end. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Aligning multiple ideas into a simple presentable product which captures the full potential of an engagement strategy with incentivised energy usage. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating a cohesive product and convincing ourselves and mentors that this is an exciting and viable engagement strategy that has the potential to revolutionise the way people view and interact with their energy use. </p>\n<h2>What's next for take charge.</h2>\n<p>Further development and possible deployment, partnering with existing data providers and retailers and investigation ways in which to manage the widespread introduction of electric vehicles and solar batteries. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cgi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/excel\">excel</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joeharris14/takecharge\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joeharris14/takecharge\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Wala \u2013 The Solar Nomad", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Please have a look at the presentation &amp; paper in the github repository</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">research</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">fun</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">csiro</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thesolarnomad/csiro-hackathon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/thesolarnomad/csiro-hackathon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Came up with the idea and luckily found some other enthusiasts after my pitch.

Users loan the money to the development community so they will receive a set amount of money back once the array is supplying the grid. The app itself is designed to help users feel the investment they make is theirs; They have a portion of a specific mirror designated to them which they can monitor in real time using basic sensors that would be attached to regions of the array.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Xcode to develop the iPhone app and photoshop to shape the UI elements.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Making an app functional within a short time frame was difficult. We wanted the app to be viable and this prototype to be a realistic demonstration.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Everything! The graphics and navigation are appealing and should attract users. It contributes to the presentation and marketing of our app. The app is designed to give the user a sense of ownership of their investment; much like rooftop solar panels, users now have a physical panel they can call theirs and monitor daily.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt that there is a large complexity around such a challenge. The program has to gain the confidence and trust of users for it to be successful.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Grid2Go</h2>\n<p>Grid2Go will require investment to reach potential customers.

This means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homeowners can refinance their solar panels and get instant cash, while retaining the benefit of cheap solar power</li>\n<li>Investors can easily create bundles of solar systems with predictable risk and returns</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The platform is built around our solar rating algorithm, which gives each solar system a standardised performance risk profile (SPRP) rating from A to D, based on factors including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The warranty lifetime of the hardware</li>\n<li>The manufacturer's reliability track record</li>\n<li>Variability of actual measured system performance</li>\n<li>Land use changes in the vicinity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When thousands of solar systems with similar ratings are bundled together, they become a predictable asset that can be financed by an investor.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>When a homeowner wants to refinance their existing solar system, they sign up to the website, and our platform collects vital data from the system so we can estimate its performance. Our platform then estimates the price of the system, based on similar ones.</p>\n<p>Investors, on the other hand, log into the website and look for systems to purchase. Second Solar allows them to  compare the different solar systems so that they can optimise the balance between risk and return.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-canonical-url=\"https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/pylon-random/second-solar-offers.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--iPP_jhZf--/https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/pylon-random/second-solar-offers.png\"/></p>\n<p>When investors make offers on particular solar assets, the user can choose the best offer.

Commercial buildings (eg. skyscrapers, offices, apartment blocks) and other larger scale installations can improve power yield by improving panel efficiency through cooling. By keeping panels closer to their nominal temperature, stakeholders can expect a greater return on clean energy.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ETA+ Solar offers stakeholders higher returns on their investment in PV by improving efficiency and yielding higher energy density. \nPV panels may be manufactured with cooling lines on the underside of the panel laminate, and fluid couplings for inlet and discharge. After the panels are installed, flexible cooling lines couple between panels and form a circuit with a small rooftop condenser and circulation pump. The assembly should be compatible with static or tracking panels.</p>\n<h2>Who wants it and why?</h2>\n<p>The waste heat collected by a 100kW solar field is approximately 42kW thermal (DNI = 1000W/m2). This heat not only makes the panels less efficient but could also be put to much better use.\nUses for low grade waste heat include:\nHVAC augmentation - using waste heat to warm spaces, offices, hotels.\nClimate control for indoor crops\nPreheating industrial processes</p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Adelaide (SunCheck)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBYseZG9dRQ?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>20 percent of solar panels in Australia are not working.
