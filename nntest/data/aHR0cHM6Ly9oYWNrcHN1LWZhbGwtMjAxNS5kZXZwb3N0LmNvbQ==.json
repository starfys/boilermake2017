This stack will be doing most of the heavy work by taking query requests and turning them into match data based on what people will teach and what they need help with.</p>\n<p>Currently our database is populated with a small amount of test data that can be accessed and modified by our android app. </p>\n<p>Studee is built to connect users together based on classes and major to help users find others to study with in each class and get the help they want and need. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TyN101/Studee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TyN101/Studee\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["People2Projects", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"People2Projects \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/853/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"People2Projects \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/607/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"People2Projects \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/589/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"People2Projects \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/592/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"People2Projects \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/634/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"People2Projects \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/635/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"People2Projects \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/650/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This mobile app was created during the fall HackPSU 2015 at University Park, PA. During this 24-hour hackathon, Invent Penn State presented the challenge of solving a problem or building a resource for incubators and co-working spaces.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Motivation usually comes in short bursts for many people at  non-predictable times. </p>\n<p>When this moment in time arrives, we want people to have a chance to act on this feeling before it becomes a missed opportunity. A missed link between interesting projects and prospective individuals is a total loss on both sides. We aim to solve this problem by expediting the initial interaction between these parties. A person that's either looking for collaborators to their own project or to join another person's project may use People2Projects to instantly start the search for existing endeavours or available expertise in their surrounding area, and commit to their motivation pretty much on command.</p>\n<p>This app will allow individuals to search up local projects at any time, which makes it a potential utility to many groups of people including college campuses, larger companies, and one's surrounding community in general.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started to form our idea while attending the mobile app development workshops offered at the hackathon, where we walked through the basics of developing software in Android Studio. At the end of the workshops we had agreed on a challenge, and started developing something originally envisioned as a \"Tinder-style matching application\" between people and projects. Equivalent efforts were spent in both iOS and Android by different team members through the night, with the intention of eventually adding a multi-platform aspect to our application and reach out to as many people as possible.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main problems we spent a lot of time on mostly involved the compatibility and cooperation between different programs we used. Figuring out how to collaborate on Github as a 5-person team through Android Studio took a lot of time, as well as creating and integrating a back-end for the application in Firebase.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We experienced what it's like to successfully collaborate in a 5-man team solely through version control, and we were able to join together our work from </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned techniques for efficient team collaboration in Github, as well as the basics of how to link together work developed in different languages.</p>\n<h2>What's next for People2Projects</h2>\n<p>Integrating the iOS and Android parts of our application through a common back-end would be the next big step in the development of People2Projects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ThePBJain/People-to-Projects/tree/master/People%20to%20Projects\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ThePBJain/People-to-Projects/tree/master/People%20to%20Projects\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/howieandersen/People2Projects\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/howieandersen/People2Projects\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote out the wireframe design for our app and also built it in iOS.

We chose a mock company called Good Buddy Truckin' that is a medium sized trucking/freight business.  The trucks would be outfitted with various IoT-style sensor systems that would send meaningful data to a database not only relevant to company performance but to the insurance agency as well.  The webpage is a tool to display and analyze the data for managers at Good Buddy to keep track of their progress and possibly create a reward system for good employee performance.

The user puts the Mindflex on their head and connects it to the computer. Packets of data are sent from the Arduino to the computer at a rate of about one packet per second. This data includes intensity of focus, relaxation, and frequencies of specific brain waves. Our program, written in Processing, processes (no pun intended) this data and creates a variety of visual representations. There are a total of four different modes each displaying data representations of different aspects of brain waves. The first mode displays a circle which changes in size and color depending on how focused the mental state of the participant is. It grows larger and turns more green as the focus of the participant increases while decreasing in size and changing colors to red proportionately as the focus decreases. The second mode, intensity of focus is also displayed using red dots. As the user becomes more intensely focused, the rate at which red dots are displayed, their size, and their intensity of the color increases. As the user becomes less focused, the rate at which red dots are displayed, their size, and their intensity of  color decreases. The third mode displays the calmness of a user. It does so by constructing a line rotating around the axis which increases in size and changes in color based on the calmness of the individual. The last mode is more for making art of the data the Mindflex receives. Using the two variables focus and calmness(x and y), it plots the distance between the two points. This mode is primarily used for the displaying of the data in an artistic form. The user can switch between these two modes by typing the numbers on the keypad of the computer.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We worked on the software implementation of transforming raw data from the MindFlex/Arduino into various visual forms. The application was constructed in Processing, a Java-based IDE mainly used for visual and art programming, although Processing has many more capabilities. To handle the data packets, Processing's Serial library was utilized.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We're a group of freshmen who collectively have very little programming experience, so the biggest (and arguably the most fun and meaningful) challenge was that we had to learn and read documentation along the way. Furthermore, the \"toy\" EEG we had the privilege to borrow from one of our friends is, of course, far from industry/research grade. Hence, most of the data output is near nonsensical as the brain is a very complex organ. The two data values we used, \"Calmness\" and \"Focus\" were black boxes and derived from trade secret algorithms, but are backed up with statistical significance and so have correlation to some degree with associated brain states.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>As a group of programming newbies, we were really just satisfied with creating a working program. It was a wonderful and unique experience to see real-world and potentially meaningful data collected and transferred by hardware and processed with our own custom-made program.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>It was really cool creating BrainArt, but we quickly realized that a major limiting factor was the quality of data reading and interpretation. If we were able to access an industry/research grade brainwave scanner, the possibilities would be endless. There are technologies such as optical drawing/typing, thought-powered video games and more that are based off of the concept of brain wave interpretation. We think that through BrainArt, we were able to take our first peek and step into the vast world of hardware/software interaction and data interpretation and visualization. So far, high school and college programming courses have only taught us basic language syntax. We've been producing passionless and boring text output in the terminal in the classroom, but BrainArt has taught us that programming can be so much more.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BrainArt</h2>\n<p>Intense brain-controlled 3D games! Beautifully brain-generated fireworks! Just kidding. There's not much more we can do with the arbitrary and limited output of the MindFlex, but it was a great programming exercise and eye-opener. Perhaps a statistical data-crunching program could be created in order to attempt to make sense of the varying brain wavelength readings in addition to the two black box values, but we don't really trust the stability and consistency of the MindFlex--there may be too much data noise/error.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">processing-ide</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">processing-serial-library</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mindflex-eeg</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8cdZ_tGQ9BfbHlLWUt5dzlFS1U\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8cdZ_tGQ9BfbHlLWUt5dzlFS1U\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Rollodex", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Talking with recruiters inspired us.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows users to trade their own and their collected business cards.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>With a team of Android developers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Near field communications was a surprisingly challenging api to use.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Many of us have never built apps before, so it was very important to them.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Android Development</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rollodex</h2>\n<p>Aesthetics, more features</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nfc\">nfc</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on the interface, tried to finish GIF file", "", "", "", ""]], ["Intelli-DJ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Intelli-DJ \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/319/954/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to provide some medium through which people with communication disorders could indicate their emotions and have fun doing it. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It uses the Microsoft Band sensors as a modified polygraph in conjunction with our neural network implementation </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I created a neural network abstraction to create neurons dynamically for every new song played.
