I took those coordinates and plugged them into the TripAdvisor to get the locations around each coordinate. Then I plotted those locations on the map and configured the information windows for the markers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Gathering the coordinates along the path, rather than just the first and last locations.

We'd spend nights playing blackjack and poker and realized how time-consuming it is to deal and shuffle cards. Also, when we played blackjack, one of us would always have to be dealer and that role was not very fun. We saw the Amazon Echo being used for other games, and realized we'd be able to use it for the card games that we know and love. During this hackathon, we built AlexaBlackJack, a blackjack card game which allows people to connect to an online game (set up by Alexa) from their phones. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>AlexaBlackJack allows multiple users to connect to an online game of blackjack from their phones (hosted by Amazon Web Services) by opening a browser and going to alexablackjack.tech and joining the room that Alexa directs them to. Once all of the players join, Alexa asks for bets (similar to a real blackjack table) and then each player is dealt two cards. The cards are seen on the player's device, along with the dealer's cards and the chip count for the respective player. Alexa goes around, asking for player commands (hit or stand). Once a player busts or is satisfied with their card total, Alexa announces the cards she drew and distributes any winnings earned by the players. All games are stored on the cloud using AWS S3 so the functionality to resume games can be built in the future.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Pain and suffering and a little bit elbow grease.</p>\n<p>We started by creating blackjack using the Deckofcards API in node.js. At the same time, another one of our teammates worked on setting up Amazon Web Services to create the Alexa skill, host the website, and store the games on the cloud. We also had a member of our team work on the website design. Once we were done with our respective pieces, we spent a majority of the time integrating the three parts together. We also spent a great amount of time debugging.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One major problem we ran into while developing the game logic was dealing with how the ace is added to hands. We found a workaround where we automatically add the ace as an 11 and then subtract 10 for every ace when we are over 21 in our card value. In addition, the way the cards were dealt to the dealer became an issue as the dealer was not receiving enough cards, even when she was under 17 in card value. Some graphical issues were also encountered, such as having older cards display for a new hand or having too many cards added to the current hand. Keeping track of the game state when three different parts of the game require concurrent versions was difficult to handle. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Well I mean one of our members recently was accepted into medical school so he was proud of that. Another member was proud that he made some really bad puns. Our last team member was proud actually sleeping at a hackathon for once, especially after having taken shots of monster energy drink in our provided toothpick holders.</p>\n<p>In terms of the project, we were most proud of being able to integrate these various services &amp; functionalities. We were also proud of being able to overcome the bugs that we encountered. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Although most of the knowledge regarding the programming languages was already understood, we definitely learned how to integrate these services together. We learned about team synergy and fostered a sense of thought management. We also incorporated cloud computing and channeled our creativity to provide the best end-user interface. Finally, we thoroughly investigated business buzzwords to best enable synergistic management solutions within our strategized efforts. </p>\n<h2>What's next for AlexaBlackJack</h2>\n<p>One word: Poker.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">deck-of-cards-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://alexablackjack.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://alexablackjack.tech/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>alexablackjack.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/narwhalkushal/bj\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/narwhalkushal/bj\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on front-end, also assisted in game testing.

If there are no threats detected, the amount of profanity, the sentiment of the tweet, and any user mentions determine whether the tweet is harassment.</p>\n<h2>Where can I download this?</h2>\n<p>The app is available on the Chrome Web Store in the link below.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kburk1997/RedFlag\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kburk1997/RedFlag\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://redflag.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://redflag.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>redflag.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redflag/icfcofbhpapplokfmbgllcfehkbaadap\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redflag/icfcofbhpapplokfmbgllcfehkbaadap\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>chrome.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://shirleyannjacksonsdankmemestash.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://shirleyannjacksonsdankmemestash.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>shirleyannjacksonsdankmemestash.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the entire project"]], ["emote.io", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"emote.io \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/448/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>emote.io</h1>\n<p>A facial recognition service to help autistic people better recognize emotions</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rickrizzo/emote.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rickrizzo/emote.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Bytes", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><em>\"I never actually know if I'm getting a good deal anymore...\"</em></p>\n<p>While enjoying some free pizza, we began to discuss the struggles of being broke students in New York City. </p>\n<p>\"The food is good, but it's also really expensive.\"</p>\n<p>\"How much is too much for good food?\"</p>\n<p>\"Bad food is cheap food and that's all that matters.\" </p>\n<p>There are countless websites to check out food in your area, but they're all missing a critical element: a comparison with other local restaurants to determine if the food is a good value. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Bytes compares the ratings and cost of a restaurant to other restaurants around you to help you get the best food for your money. Bytes, taking into account cost/rating ratio of local restaurants,  calculates a score and assigns a letter grade determining the quality of the deal. The higher the score, the better the deal!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Back-end dependencies: Requests, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, SciPy, GeoPy</p>\n<p>Bytes is written in Python, using the TripAdvisor and Yelp APIs. GeoPy was used to get location; its ability to easily acquire latitude and longitude coordinates worked well with TripAdvisor's <em>map</em> request. From there, the TripAdvisor API generates a list of restaurants within the specified distance feeds their cost and rating into SciPy, which calculates a linear regression based on this data. From there, the restaurants are rated based on their actual position either above or below the regression line; above meaning a better than average deal, and below meaning worse than average. NumPy is used to simplify some of the mathematical work behind this. The data is returned with the name of the restaurant, the score, and the letter grade. The Yelp API is used to relevant information factoring into our formula and search results. Information not accessible through the Yelp API was obtained through web scraping using the <em>requests</em> and <em>beautifulsoup</em> libraries. It allows for searching through keywords, with flexibility for a smoother user experience. The front end was written mostly in HTML. JavaScript and Flask was used to integrate front end (mostly user input) with the back end. Bootstrap was used for a sleek interface and compatibility with mobile devices. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Making the front end was challenging because none of us actually knew how to do it or had any real experience with that. The greatest challenge by far has been using Flask to tie the front and back ends together, with the largest obstacle being getting user input into the back end. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The front end came out very nicely considering our lack of previous experience. At present, Bytes is extensible (to hotels, attractions, and other things under the TripAdvisor and Yelp APIs), and it is good at error handling. Being able to learn new APIs quickly is a skill we gladly continue to improve upon. We are also proud of the idea we used for rating the restaurants: it makes sense, is efficient, and is something other than coding that we came up with. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use HTML and JavaScript, how to use a number of APIs and libraries to obtain and process data, and we learned a bit about how Flask works to tie the front and back ends together. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Bytes</h2>\n<p>Bytes, in its current state, works very efficiently for finding local deals on food. However, this behavior could easily be extended to other areas such as hotels, attractions, and other things. Adding other features such as displaying menus, having user accounts to allow users to save favorites and view eating history, share recommendations with friends, etc. Bytes could also (in a non-evil way) collect data about its users, using this information to improve user experience and perhaps even local food options. Most importantly, cleaning up the integration between the front and back ends using Flask would be great (as in do it right this time). </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AbirHassan/RayofHype/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AbirHassan/RayofHype/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Assisted with computing the linear regression for the data on the back end, and implemented Flask to build and host the web app, and also tie the back and the front ends together.", "Worked on front end using html, implemented Bootstrap.

Everything that isn't due tomorrow, is due the day after, and you've got a LOT of work to do. So you multitask like crazy, working on a presentation and a paper at once while managing this social gathering you are planning for the weekend. Naturally, that means you are going to have numerous tabs open. What if you could do this in a better, more efficient, and organized way?</p>\n<p>Tabber helps organize your internet activities by allowing you to declutter your Chrome browser. You simply download the extension, click on it, and set the time for when you want the tab to be re-opened in your browser again. Everyone knows bookmarking doesn't work because that list grows too quickly and often links at the bottom get forgotten. Tabber is better than all the other extensions/apps that manage your tabs because it's active, it force opens the browser and forces you to pay attention to the tab. Set your registration pages to open a few days before the deadline so you don't forget. Set your homework assignment webpage to open in a few hours so you get back on track if distracted.</p>\n<p>I built Tabber with a main JSON file, and then standard web development markup languages (HTML and CSS) and Javascript with the JQuery library to make the extension interact.</p>\n<p>In this prototype you can only open a tab at a time, but in the future you will be able to open windows full of related tabs for a specific topic, and even set recurring tabs, that open at intervals constantly (i.e every day for the week leading up to a final) so you can not forget things and stay on track. </p>\n<p>Use your tabs better and stay organized with Tabber</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BDialloASC/Tabber\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BDialloASC/Tabber\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Destino", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>This is Destino.

The new technology of sensors and electronics makes remote access to healthcare data possible. Remote access of healthcare data can save a lot of money and time by its convenience and efficiency. Remote ECG is a good example.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is a hardware based hacking. Three ECG electrodes are connected to MSP430 microcontroller and stick on left arm, right arm, and right leg of the user. The microcontroller samples the signal gathered from ECG electrodes and send it to PC through UART in a live stream. The PC receives the data and and upload it to the cloud. The patient's family or doctor is then able to access the ECG data remotely and monitor the user's heart health.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The electrode on the leg is connected to the Ground. The difference of voltage between left arm electrode and right arm electrode is calculated as the ECG result. We use Energia to program MSP430 for analog data sampling and live plotting sampled data stream on the screen. We use a C program to save the data to a csv file and upload it to Plot.ly for remote access and figure plotting.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The ECG electrode voltage is very weak. We tried different circuits to amplify it. Although the final result is still noisy, the trace of the ECG data is visible.

After playing around with several ideas, we decided we wanted to do some kind of fun game that could be won by logical constructs.  After thinking through a few examples, we landed on connect-four! It's a fun project we would both be interested in.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>When you run main.py, it will ask you how many players are playing and their names.  To make them AI, name them 'AI 1', 'AI 2', etc.  Then it goes turn by turn filling in pieces like in the real game until someone wins! See if that will be you!\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Lindsay focused mostly on the underlying logic of the AI while Greg made the front-end and graphics! We talked about what choosing the best column to put a piece into would depend on and what we wanted it to look like, then got to work! Running into problems and integration we conferred to find the best solution.  We researched things we didn't know how to do and broke problems into small pieces to be checked individually.  \n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>At first, we had our 2-D arrays organized in different ways, so for one (0,0) was in the top left and for the other in the bottom left.  After talking about what would be the smoothest end option, we decided to just do bottom left and go column then row.  Along the way we would realize different optimizations or returns that would make the code run much better and then have to go back and change those things.  In addition, the AI had to check for adding pieces to both the left and the right and see if this had the potential to lead to a win.  The edge cases led to some complications, though all ended up getting resolved.  In addition, the AI had to check to see if when it placed a piece in a column it would go into the row it wanted it in.  This was resolved, but will likely lead to complications in a multi turn strategy.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The graphics look awesome, and it's a functional game against a strategic AI and any other player! The AI checks which lengths of pieces already exist and if a line of four can be created.  Everything is color-coded and smooth.  In addition, you can play local internet multiplayer! Play with friends from different computers.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>We learned how to work together, and got more practice working efficiently under a time limit.  We had great communication and got practice with python graphics.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What's next for connect-four</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Right now the AI finds the best place to put a piece one move at a time.  However, it can't see past one move, so in helping itself get a longer line it may set the other player up for a win.  Multi turn strategy implementation is next.

It uses the library to implement 2D side scrolling arcade action as well as game physics. The front-end uses Ajax to communicate with the Python backend. The Python backend is running Python 2.7 and a BaseHTTPServer. It stores high scores on the server using Python's builtin pickle module. When Ajax sends a request, the Python server sends back a list of the top ten scores separated by <code>\\n</code>.</p>\n<h2>Hosting</h2>\n<p>The back-end and front-end are both hosted using an E2 instance of AWS running Windows server 2012. The domain is hosted on DotTech domains.</p>\n<h2>Running the front-end locally</h2>\n<p>Some browsers have local CORS restrictions, so you should run a server locally\nusing the command <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> in the root directory of this\nproject. Then, open your webbrowser to <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://octotramp.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://octotramp.tech/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>octotramp.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ejmsoftware/octotramp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ejmsoftware/octotramp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the various game animations, and a lot of the game's logic.", "I worked on the back-end as well as the assets for our program's design.

We see VR as being the next big thing in the upcoming years and having the chance to develop skills using both pieces of hardware drives us to continue to learn more about the tools.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Git Pulled VR is a virtual reality experience that introduces a new type of mechanic, player movement and grappling capabilities. With the combined powers of the Oculus Rift and Leap Motion, our game brings out the full experience of clinging from wall to wall and swinging across multitudes of platforms. With the added virtual obstacle, the player can have fun grappling their way to the finish line, allowing them to experience the full virtual experience.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In order to create Git Pulled VR we relied heavily on making the mechanics functional. Our game emphasizes on our complex c# scripts that are used to make the movement and grapple possible.

The added functionality of a touchpad and keyboard lets you remotely access your computer to play videos or search. That said ,the current applications that provide interactions via a mobile phone have a fixed number of keys and layouts. Moreover a clicker application designed for presentation can't be used for playing a game. So it is important to have dynamically generated keys on a universal clicker app.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>UniClick is web app that permits the user to remotely control a computer from a smartphone. Developer community can design their custom keyboard layout for a specific applications by specifying a keyboard schema. A user can then choose from the supported applications to get the required layout. Also, since multiple users can control an application, UniClick provides an alernative to gaming consoles.</p>\n<p>On top of this, UniClick also enables interaction with the audience. The presenter can create questionnaires that will be sent during the presentation. Audience members using the web app can then respond to yes/no, multiple choice  or short-answer questions which will be fed back to the presenter's phone. These types of interactions are proven to provide a more accurate and complete overview of student understanding for teachers.</p>\n<p>UniClick represents a unification of both clicker and survey functionality in one app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>UniClick is built using Meteor for the front-end web interface, CouchBase for the database, DropWizard for the backend and Android Studio for the Android app. Java.Robot enables the remote-control functionality.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Enabling the remote-connection from a phone took a lot of time and caused many headaches.

This is a common problem around the world, but especially in college towns across America, where GroupMe is the communication method of choice for friends. FooBot works to solve this problem. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FooBot quizzes each member of a group chat about their preferences, pickiness, budget and location in a conversational format. Given that information, and using a little bit of magic, it returns the most equidistant restaurant that everyone will enjoy. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Python scripts hosted on Amazon EC2, maintained and monitored with bash scripts.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to solve a common real-life problem. This can not be said by most, even at hackathons! This is not a tech demo, or a server built with Haskell, but instead a real finished product that will make our lives easier. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Server-sided automatic error handling was a chore, but we eventually accomplished it.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for FooBot</h2>\n<p>We hope to eventually expand to further chat platforms and offer suggestions for other services such as entertainment, hikes etc. In the future we could even build FooBot into a web-client where friends would not have to rely on chat services.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/groupme\">groupme</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CharlieIO/Foo-Bot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CharlieIO/Foo-Bot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Around Me!!!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Whenever my team-mates and I visited a new place, searching for a hangout spot or a restaurant became a task. The around me feature provided by Google used to come handy at such times. Since it was our first time at a Hackathon, we went ahead and implemented the same feature provided in our own way.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You just have to open the homepage and based on whether you are hungry or bored, Around Me!!! will suggest you 20 eateries or attractions closest to you. Moreover, you can read its review on TripAdvisor before deciding.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Google maps javascript api's and TripAdvisor's geo-location api to determine the user's location and then search for places around him/her. We used javascript, html, and css along with jquery, ajax, and json.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we had a big time working with the api's since it was our first time. We also spent considerable amount of time on working with json because the json data was not available in the format that we needed. Once, we found a solution to it, we rushed through the rest of the development phase.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to determine, user's exact co-ordinates with just a click of the button and accordingly retrieve places around him/her. This feature which we had always been using in Google, we were able to implement it ourselves.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt a lot about working with API's along with javascript and json. We did not have much experience working on web technologies prior to working on this project, but by the time we reached the final phase, we believe we learnt a lot about api's and web technologies. This will act as motivation for us to try and develop more projects under this domain. Finally, we learnt that team effort is equally important along with the skillsets because as a team we were able to achieve a lot in a very short span of time. We look forward to attend more hackathons and stay in the learning flux.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Around Me!!!</h2>\n<p>In its current phase, Around Me!!! is just a webpage service but we plan to develop a mobile app which will be more portable and convenient to use for mobile devices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-ajax-search\">google-ajax-search</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tripadvisor\">tripadvisor</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dkataria/AroundMe-HackRPI2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dkataria/AroundMe-HackRPI2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the idea of creating a user friendly web page along with team members to seamless integration of API's into the project and representing the received results in a user friendly manner.", "", ""]], ["Rate my course", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Typically, when a student drops a class it is because the class is not what he or she expected.

Then my mission started. Also recently I've been looking at other deep learning models on Github, which inspired me to create this AI prediction software with Deep learning. As a high-schooler this project was one of my best projects and I'm proud of it.</p>\n<h2>What it does (SIMPLE)</h2>\n<p>Takes Low res video video, outputs High-Res video</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I first started out with the idea of sub-pixel convolutional nets. I used Theano as my deep learning framework, and existing scientific python libraries for the machine learning algorithms. The way the program upscaled a LR image is through sub pixel convolution nets with fractional stride of 1 in the LR space. Which I found out can be naively implemented by interpolation, perforate or un-pooling from LR space to HR space followed by a convolution with a stride of 1 in HR space. These implementations increase the computational cost by a factor of r2, since convolution happens in HR space.So Given a training set consisting of HR image examples\nIHR,n = 1...N, we generate the corresponding LR n images ILR , n = 1 . . . N , and calculate the pixel-wise mean. Then it is able that the implementation of the above periodic shuffling can be very fast compared to reduction or convolution in HR space because each operation is independent and is parallelizable in one cycle. Which then allowed the layer to operate log2r2 times faster compared to deconvolution layer in the forward pass. For the training dataset I used the OpenImages Dataset( <a href=\"https://github.com/openimages/dataset\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/openimages/dataset</a>)  and used this script to resize them(<a href=\"https://github.com/ejlb/google-open-image-download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ejlb/google-open-image-download</a>) and got an <strong>okay~</strong> model(Trained in a very short time because of the hackathon!!!!!)  After getting a model to use I implemented the sub-pixel convolutional nets, the Network layers, and made a few tweaks to the Training methods. After this I used two libraries installed with home-brew called FFmpeg and Libav for the video processing, which converted the video to individual frames(FFmpeg) for the model to pass, and then re-structured the frames in a mp4 format(Libav.)</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into The challenges I ran into very <strong>SEVERE</strong></h2>\n<p>0.5.

You spend days walking through different dealerships, days talking to multiple salesmen, and you waste time finding a car. People spend hours walking in IKEA<br/>\nMany of the things we shop for don't require that we think about them in the context of where we will use them. When you are shopping for a new laptop or a phone, you may care about the hardware specifications of the device relative to its competition; you might even care if it has a glossy metallic finish instead of a less attractive plastic shell. You likely <em>won't</em> care if it looks good sitting on the kitchen table or worry if it will fit in your backpack. \n    Many of the things we shop for do have this problem though, and they're often the things that give us the biggest headaches. Have you ever gone furniture shopping and struggled to visualize how well a particular couch will fit into your living room? Even with a good tape measure, it can be challenging to form a mental picture of how <em>well</em> it will fit. Most couches have odd angles and protrusions that can affect perceived size. It might leave less room for walking than you previously imagined. What about TVs? Would the 65 inch TV that you really want look just completely overbearing? What about a 40 inch? Is it too small? The goal of Commerce-Reality is to allow you to more easily answer those questions within the context of your own space.</p>\n<h2>WHAT IT DOES</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Commerce reality is a virtual/augmented reality app for online shopping. It allows you to browse for merchandise in an online store, and then project those items into your home in fule scale. This allows you to see if that couch you were looking at really does fit along that wall in your living room, or if it sticks out just a little too much.\nWith this app you can look through the online store, and view the items directly, or tag them so you can view them later.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>HOW WE BUILT IT</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Aman had been familiar with Microsoft Unity and introduced the rest of us to the software.  We spent a few hours familiarizing ourselves with Unity, C#, and creating UI designs.  Eric designed the code that analyzed and stored the data which we stored in a CSV file created by Michael.  Sam conceptualized the UI and Aman implemented it in Unity.  After that we tried in Eric's code to link the data with the application and populate our various fields.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>One of the primary challenges faced in this project was handling the backend data. The effort required to build the database, parse it into custom data structures, and populating the gui comprised the vast majority of our time and resources. Some problems were platform specific. The Hololens filesystem isn't directly accessible to the developer, so we had to jump through a number of hoops simply to get our database file onto the device and readable.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another major issue was working with the UI. Currently the Beta version of Microsoft Hololens doesn't natively support UI interaction, so we had to hack the UI by adding colliders to all of the elements. </p>\n<h2>ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'RE PROUD OF</h2>\n<p>We're proud of our flexibility.\nOur code was structured to be upscaled. Through using data files and file reading techniques, we're able to upscale the department store to encompass all sorts of products. </p>\n<p>We're proud of our optimization. The number one purpose of creating this application is to improve e-commerce user experience. By creating a simple and beautiful UI, we accomplished that goal. We even managed to heavily reduce lag in our project, making it more user friendly. </p>\n<h2>WHAT WE LEARNED</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> The most stalling factor was our limited experience with the development tools. No one member was fluent in C#, Unity3D, and Visual Studio. This made the division of labor more natural, and ensured that everyone was learning another field in order to contribute to the project. \n We would be remiss if we failed to mention that we inevitably gained valuable experience working sleep deprived and to a harsh deadline. We all became somewhat irritable at least once over the course of the night, but we kept it from negatively impacting our team performance.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>WHAT'S NEXT</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Ultimately, this app will depend on an online web store to supply\n</code></pre>\n<h2>BUILT WITH</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>This application was built using Unity-3D and the Microsoft Hololens toolkit for Visual Studio.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Pure Life Reddit Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pure Life Reddit Game \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/444/625/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Screenshot</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>The world's first MMO Dungeon Crawler powered by reddit comments!
