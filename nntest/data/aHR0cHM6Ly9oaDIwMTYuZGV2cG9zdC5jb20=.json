In our new design, the train is deployed with side propellers to capture the wind energy during the high speed trips as well as smart glass composed roofs and windows which capture solar energy.

Once powered on it connects to a web based weather service and collects weather data points based on the location of the device. Depending on the customization of the Arduino and its programming, it will determine how to light the LED fixed on the container. Depending on how the LED is being lit up it will communicate a basic yes or no answer to whatever it was programmed to do. An example of this in use would be programming the Arduino to collect data on weather associated with migraines. If weather that would induce migraines would happen to occur within the next 48 hours, the device would quickly blink the LED until conditions changed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started by soldering all the necessary connections from the Arduino to the Led and DC power input. We then connected the Arduino to a laptop and began to tinker with the code. While the programmers of the group worked on code, the design portion of the team began to sculpt containers in Blender and investigate open source options as well. After the design team finished with selecting and editing proper containers, the designs were then sent to be 3-D printed. After the print was completed, we fitted the circuitry within the containers and connected necessary power. After verifying that our first model worked, we repeated the process for the second product.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>3-D printing became a huge time issue. If one print came out bad, it would be another four hours of printing before we had another candidate for a container. Coding bugs in the Arduino's software made progress on testing our device a slow process. 3-D modeling software Blender, had a few .stl file issues that we had to resolve. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Having a working product is an achievement we are quite proud of. Not only were we able to create one working version of this concept, but we coded and crafted another working product that measured a different symptom.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our group has gained a new perspective on time management in regard to how involved the process of 3-D printing is. Mistakes in the 3-D design faze could cost us precious hours. We also explored new coding methods and discovered the application of it within physical hardware. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Better Weather Buddy</h2>\n<p>We plan on exploring further possibilities with what ailments can be measured and forewarned using this design. During this Hackathon we made two products that detect migraine conditions and advise temperature conditions.

With the right set of skills and a few applications, Alexa could be a staple in the classroom setting. This would allow teachers to make a game of Jeopardy in the classroom simple and even more fun than before. </p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Inspiration for Alexa Jeopardy came from many places. First, we were experimenting with the Amazon Echo to see what it could do, we saw that there were developer tools we could use, we tried to access them, which seemed to be a challenge at first, but we eventually got it. Another inspiration was from a school game called Eggspert. Eggspert was a playful classroom tool to create classroom quiz games and trivia. So we thought of an idea to incorporate Alexa, an eggspert type system, and also Jeopardy into one project!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our Hack is to create Jeopardy for the classroom and in-home for the Amazon Echo. As in Jeopardy, you will speak a category and a number denomination. Alexa will hear you and then read you the question and display it on one interface. Alexa will then wait.  After a prompt for  and tell you if you are right or not and award points accordingly. Each team/player will have an interface with a button on it that will be used to buzz in. The teacher will also have an interface that allows them to override answers if Alexa hears wrong. The teacher will also have the ability to pass the question to the next person that buzzed in if they didn't answer in a timely fashion. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We build most of the system using AWS and Amazon Dev. We also used JavaScript. We started with the Alexa Skills. Then we would build the web interfaces. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>At the start, we had a big problem with setting up amazon accounts and dealing with AWS. We spent a few hours trying to get one account to work for us but we eventually figured it out. So we had a very late start hacking. We ran into a few problems with making Alexa read and register things so we were unable to connect all of the pieces and make them all run together.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Once everything was starting to come together we were proud of how far we came. We also were proud to be one of the few teams to program with the Amazon Echo. We were very proud of being able to try out a bunch of new technologies, even though we did not incorporate them in our hack, such as the leap motion and oculus rift. The biggest thing we are proud of is our idea. We are all very excited to be able to present it.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned a lot about the Alexa API and how to use it, using JavaScript with showed us that developing for the Amazon Echo could be pretty appealing to developers, using Amazon's AWS. We also learned a bit about our strengths and weaknesses when working in a group, especially since we mostly created our group at the hackathon itself. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Alexa-Jeopardy</h2>\n<p>We would have liked to create a physical buzzer to buzz into our system. The online interface would get an entire redesign. We would also have been adding the ability to create custom categories and a bigger library of already made ones. Challenges with accessing the AWS largely prevented our goals.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">echo</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AlexaMasterRace/alexa-jeopardy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AlexaMasterRace/alexa-jeopardy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["NOTiFY", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As with all great ideas, the origin can be traced back to the great Michael Scott.

Being big fans of both Arduinos and Codebender.cc we decided to bring the web-based IDE back to life with our new application, Phify Programmer. We looked at the pros and cons of most Arduino IDEs and worked out what would be best for almost every user. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Phify Programmer is a web-based Arduino IDE that allows users to write, save, compile and flash Arduino code through our website. Allows Chromebooks to compile code for the Arduino, which in the past was not possible.</p>\n<p>From personal experience we see the struggles of working with Arduinos at our school. Each student has a Chromebook, but it is impossible to work on these devices on our Chromebooks. With this application we solve this problem and more. We also offer the ability to use example code from the original Arduino IDE, the ability to save to the cloud and to compile code from a website. We also plan on taking Arduino education to the next level by eventually adding drag n' drop coding for Arduino which has never been done before on a web-based application.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a large majority of original code for the bulk of the project. For the editor, we used the open source project Ace Editor. For parts of the compiler, we used bits and pieces from the old open source Codebender.cc code. </p>\n<p>The application has three levels in which it works: browser, extension and server. The application first starts by sending the text in the text editor to the server in order to be converted to HEX. After that, the HEX code is sent to the browser and then to the extension. The extension converts the HEX to binary, flashes the code to the Arduino and then sends the status the the browser. The final status is from the extension is displayed in the browser.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a lot of issues with the compiler crashing all of our code leading to constant rewrites of the same code. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the amount of work and progress we saw in the short period of time. We got a good chunk of work done that may have taken months to achieve. We also built a strong browser IDE for the user.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about compilers and working with extensions. We have never worked with extensions running in the background until today. This was for sure the biggest thing we learned from this project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Phify Programmer</h2>\n<p>Continue to optimize the application is the next big step. Bugs and glitches still occur, but can easily be removed with some simple optimization. We also need to work on adding additional libraries into our code for the Arduino IDE. Working on a version that is completely client side can also be a possibility for Phify Programmer. We also plan to work on a drag n' drop editor.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scss\">scss</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ace</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">extension</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://huskie.nermolov.com/text/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://huskie.nermolov.com/text/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>huskie.nermolov.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["F.I.L.T.h", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration- Was to recreate a childhood game from the ground up.</h2>\n<h2>What it does- It's a platform game</h2>\n<h2>How We built- we used Untiy3D engine and Java Script</h2>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into- fairly new to unity engine and coding was challenging to work with.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of- First finished game, deeper knowledge with unity engine and game developing</h2>\n<h2>What I learned- A lot easier to work with team then alone, learning to use unity engine, learning to create music from sound bites.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for F.I.L.T.h - new levels, possibly story line, better graphics , new sprites</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I was the one using the unity engine.

Once registered, one can see a list of doctors with their field of expertise, their charge per minute, and their location, which brings you to Google Maps with the location of the said doctor. If you click on a doctor, you will be brought to that doctor's contact page. You will be able to see their location and try to create an appointment with them. If successful, one will be able to see a list of appointments in the appointments page.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it with an ASP.NET back-end combined with some jQuery and Bootstrap front-end. We used codeanywhere.com to collaborate on the project in real-time. We used ftp to connect to our website to see the actual result that people would see. We had a TODO list and we communicated to the rest of the team which task we were taking on.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had various challenges. For example, we ran into some ASP.NET compatibility problems with our front-end. Another example was when we had to write our own algorithms whether they be for sorting through tables or testing for time concurrencies.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully made a login system which keeps track of your appointments with doctors. We also were successful at implementing the Google Maps API to get the doctors near your location and display their location on the map.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We each learned a new skill in front-end or back-end, and experienced the other side of the web development process. For the front-end developers, we got our first taste of ASP.NET. For the back-end developer, he improved his front-end skills, mainly his javascript and jQuery.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NetMed</h2>\n<p>Implement an expandable list of doctors. We would also ask for the user's location to find the doctors around their area. We would allow doctors to communicate with patients with notifications and use reminders to notify patients and doctors of upcoming appointments.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/asp-net\">asp.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-basic\">visual-basic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://netmed.iaimtech.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://netmed.iaimtech.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>netmed.iaimtech.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I mostly focused on parsing that table from the database and sorting through the information.

Each of us completed different objectives (design, coding, functionality) to arrive at our finished project.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We used socket for the chat online and that took quite a while to get configure correctly. We are also working out the bugs on extracting files and photos automatically from a stream of text messages. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have been able to successfully set up a chat system between people and pin important messages to a separate board. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Freeflow Message Board</h2>\n<p>We would like to expand this application to be smarter about sorting data from the messages between people. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag

What happens when we scale it up, When we and technology progress we will need a new way of transpiration, I came into this Hackathon wanting to create an app that would allowed me to learn wireframe design with Marvel and learn more advance features of Photoshop so I create Hitch (like Hitchhiker Guide to The Galaxy)</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a full UI and design of what an app would look like for an UBER like application that would provide for space transport. I mainly focused on design and making it look good. I also used animations to give it a slick look. I created 2 apps, one is an app customers would use and another pilots would use.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Photoshop to prototype all my screens then animated them and edited them in Marvel to create a finished product.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting a consistent UI and a real to life professional look was one of the greatest challenges. I learned a lot by getting past this and learned about backend dev.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The Screens look well made and high quality and the animations complement that</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned advanced features in Photoshop and how to use Marvel for full stack web and mobile design, a very demanding career.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hitch - The Future Of Transport</h2>\n<p>Making it a functional app from a prototype that focuses on design, making the sensors in the phone adapt, It could be done easily with more time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">marvel-wireframe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">android-fastboot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">android-adb</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/build/6lc848srodriiit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://marvelapp.com/build/6lc848srodriiit\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>marvelapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marvelapp.com/build/509636lshhsdu3s\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://marvelapp.com/build/509636lshhsdu3s\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>marvelapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["HeadshotVR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Badda Bing, Baddda BOOM</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Ya know, who it is, its ya boy</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Don't ask me dumb questions</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>NUTIN</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>HEADSHOTVR DUMMY</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>a lot</p>\n<h2>What's next for HeadshotVR</h2>\n<p>A search algorithm.
