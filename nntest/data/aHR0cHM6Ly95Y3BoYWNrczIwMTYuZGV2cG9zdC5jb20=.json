[["Book Spy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>During my first semester at college I observed multiple students that were not able to reach their academic potential because they did not have the means to buy expensive school textbooks. While listening to Mr. McEligot speak about striving to solve problems instead of make money, I realized that my software development skills can be used to help my low-income friends who either cannot afford textbooks or become financially burdened my them. The project also incorporated iOS design which I am interested in learning about.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Book Spy monitors online textbook prices for its users. This not only alleviates users of searching for affordable textbooks, but results in cheaper textbooks as Book Spy is capable of scouting deals constantly and independently. Book Spy also utilizes a range of productivity algorithms to make searching faster and more efficient. For example, Book Spy's data source is interchangeably derived from multiple free web APIs to offer a diversity of results and allow the app to be free. Additionally, Book Spy approaches categorizing profits in multiple ways. For example, the user is only emailed about a profitable opportunity if they have not been exposed to it on the app. Likewise, Book Spy determines the in-app profitability of a textbook based on long-term average prices and short-term ones. the majority of Book Spy's functionality is contained in the backend between the PHP and the MySQL. I did this so that I can easily add an Android app and website without re-designing its functionality.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I first built as much of the front end (in Swift) as I could. This does not mean the visually appealing aspects, but the user inputs and the software's outputs. I found this method of programming to be beneficial because I was able to gain a thorough and concise understanding of the data structures and interactions necessary for the app to perform well, remain streamlined, and be completable in just 36 hours of work. It became apparent very quickly that one single API service would not be sufficient for Book Spy as it often submits multiple queries at a time between single user searches and the far more demanding and constantly running script to allocate and analyze data about the users' textbooks as quickly as possible without being IP throttled. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Book Spy's frequency of API requests exceeded the limits of any API I could find. After a bit of thinking, I wrote a script that cycles API keys in coordination with API time limits. This allowed me to access all of the data that I needed without dividing the requests among a wide range of APIs which compromises the app's simplicity, security, and speed. Another challenge that I encountered was how to define a 'profitable' book. I realized that there is no one 'perfect' way to define a profitable textbook, therefore I needed multiple algorithms to determine profitability depending on the user's involvement and and age of the users' textbooks. Lastly, I ran into the problem of having to utilize with a database not only on another platform and responsive to a different programming language, but having to communicate with it entirely through character-restricting URLs. This forced me to tediously analyze every form of user input because not only was the URL sensitive to a range of characters, but it was a direct connection to my relatively unsecure database due to the hackathon's time constraints.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am most proud of my database schema. It is very clean, relationally grouped, and easy to transition between. I am also very proud of the script I wrote that analyzes about 3 textbooks per second and collects about fifteen pieces of data each. I am also very proud of myself that I completed this project in only 34 hours. Although I feel like I will sleep for at least twenty hours when I get home.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to intelligently approach complex projects involving lots of data. This was the first project I truly feel comfortable about that incorporates multiple scripts running simultaneously most of the time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Book Spy</h2>\n<p>I will be submitting it to the iOS app store after a few revisions in a more relaxed environment. After that, I plan to make a website and Android app. I anticipate both to be relatively easy as the overwhelming majority of the algorithmic processes crucial to the service's functionality are complete, and easily accessible from a wide variety of platforms. I also plan to incorporate many more unique textbook APIs. I anticipate that this will yield more profitable results for the users and enable Book Spy to support a larger user-base while remaining free of charge.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phpmyadmin\">phpmyadmin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">email</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">automation</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xampp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">database</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">users</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nickpitoniak9/bookSpy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nickpitoniak9/bookSpy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed and developed everything"]], ["Interactive Pile Of Trash", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Paper Toss on iOS</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Challenges the user to throw a bag into a dumpster</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using various strategies and the game engine Unity</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Having not completed two semesters of programming courses so far, I was definitely challenged to learn new methods of programming</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>All assets, Prefabrications(other than VRTK and SteamVR) were created by myself.

The inspiration behind our minimalistic and concise app drew from our previous experiences with functionally diverse applications as well as our experiences with incorporating complexity such as third party APIs. Safety Net is meant to be able to interact with other applications with also being easy to use and to understand as a standalone mobile app.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Safety Net is a personal safety awareness application. Designed to work well as a standalone mobile application or in tandem with other larger applications, Safety Net is a valuable tool for developers and everyday users. As a standalone app, Safety Net can determine the general safety of a user's current location at the push of a button. Based on metrics such as geographic location, the number of recent local crimes and the time of day, the app assigns a value between one and five to represent the level of safety the user can expect. These features can also be used to create useful data sets such as heat maps for Google Maps to use in navigation around high-risk areas.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We hosted our data on Amazon's Web Services with our mobile app being built on the iOS and Android platforms. Using AWS, we had a single backend database that was accessible by both mobile applications, incorporating a Redis database that was queried by functions written in Python. Using SpotCrime's API, we had our mobile application call the API, returning the user's geographic location while also returning crime statistics relevant to their current location. With our functions, we processed all the data to generate a safety rating for the user. Our algorithms also hold certain crimes such as shootings and arson, with more weight than crimes such as vandalism. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A large challenge we came across was through using SpotCrime's API. Originally, our EC2 instance called the API and parsed through it, selecting specific sets of data for our functions. We were very comfortable having our instance performing these calculations and just posting the data to our mobile devices. During late Saturday afternoon, our connection with the API and our EC2 instance suddenly became severed, giving us 403 Forbidden errors every time we tried to call the API. After trying to switch our backend environment and not having success with that, our team decided to go back using AWS but called the API through the mobile devices, communicating back to our Linux instance and acting as a proxy. We were successful in this attempt to keep the environment we built a majority of the project on, while implementing a 'hack' to circumvent momentary confusion.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>In experiencing the hardships of almost having to restart our project due to unforeseen events, we are proud of our persistence in not giving up and playing around forces out of our control. Additionally, our project also functions as its own API, in which data sets that we parsed through machine learning to build informational value that can be accessed through methods built on the server. This allows other applications to query GETS towards Safety Net and derive their own analytics. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A takeaway from this project is the intense processes of building a cross platform mobile application. It becomes vital that both applications can interact with our database functions, while being programmed in two different languages. Furthermore, we learned that being able to adjust after setbacks allows us to look at the project through a different perspective, which can be very beneficial. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Safety Net</h2>\n<p>Future plans for Safety Net include the ability to track different locations, heat maps, and a website displaying conglomerated data. We also plan to further refine both our iOS and Android applications, ensuring a consistent user experience while adding more features.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/redis\">redis</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I built the Android application and researched the API that we used to find our crime data.

That was us on Friday night, and honestly, we weren't too worried. With the incredibly talented and creative people surrounding us, it was hard to see a world in which we couldn't come up with something. After asking around, we realized that York is facing a challenge. With the advent of Silicon Valley, almost all big name tech companies have migrated to the West Coast, leaving even the strongest of Eastern cities high and dry in recent years. York has seen this more than most, and this problem is starting to manifest itself in other ways. Heroin addiction, crime, violence and tensions have skyrocketed in the community. Hearing about these tragic trends motivated us to do something for the city. We want, no, need to bring tech back to the east coast, and York has everything that is required to make that happen. Since two floors of the Yorktowne Hotel will be renovated and repurposed (as we understand it), we thought it fitting to locate our endeavor here, where YCP Hacks was hosted. However, this business venture could be carried out in any of the unused industrial complexes still in York.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Helps connect people to the hacking community and lays out a plan to develop a hacker space in York PA, with the intended result of economic growth stimulation.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Started by developing a website skeleton on bootstrap, then modified it beyond what bootstrap's IDE was capable of to fit the needs of our website.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Bootstrap's clunky GUI that wasn't exactly intuitive.

I brought my laptop that had unity on it. I decided that I would do something with Unity on it if I didn't find something that I could actively do with a group. I wanted to do something that is challenging but actually doable within the time given. After a hour or so on Friday I made a spur of the moment decision, to make a 2d game in Unity so that I do not waste my time doing nothing. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is game where the objective is to get to the green platform on the map. There are three levels that increase in difficulty as you progress. There are three types of enemies. Type 0 moves vertically. Type 1 moves horizontally. They change direction when they either get too far from their origin point or they bump into another object. Type 2 are stationary, but they rotate.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built it in the Unity engine. I used default objects. I used C# as the programming language. I spent most of Friday night, Saturday and a good portion of really early morning Sunday.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I did not have much experience with Unity or c#. The only real experience I previously have had is only writing a simple one level Frogger clone. I had a problem with my type 1 enemies a few times. You see I had made an empty object to hold the type one enemies. I accidentally extended the enemy component to it, which affected all the type 1 enemies to follow the directions for both type 1 and type 0. I made the enemy class have a field for type that chose the actions that each type preform. Since the field defaults at 0, the object extended the zero field to the objects that followed the 1 field. That caused the type ones to follow both type 0 and type 1's movement.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I made a game with multiple levels and had features that are above what my previous experience with unity would probably suggest for the next project (granted there was a lot more hours put into Sidescroller).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned various commands in the C# language and more of a different way to code than I usually do. The language I have the most expierence and therefore has affected my programming the most is Java.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sidescroller</h2>\n<p>Maybe more levels and a start menu (at some point).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a
