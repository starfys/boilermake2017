Not only do you need to parse through every transaction, but you need to dig through old receipts and match them up  with the bank records (if you actually still have the receipts). Spenser takes care of that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Spenser quickly takes a picture of your receipt and matches it up with your credit card/bank record so you can throw the receipt out and never worry about it again.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used an API called ABBY to handle the OCR transcribing and we used Plaid API to safely and gain access to users bank transaction history.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Authorizing with banking is a hassle. To get the authorization flow working in a way where it is initiated by the iOS application but authorizes the Rails application to access the users' data was a struggle (expectedly, privacy is important and therefore complicated).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works as intended. Can do the signup flow, get users' transactions, take a picture, and store to S3 for later.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We're really good at building apps. Jokes. Everything takes longer than you expected. Little things can burn hours. Need to be prepared to overcome unforeseen obstacles. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Spenser</h2>\n<p>Going to patch some things up and allow authentication using multiple bank accounts, implement filtering, and implement exports and finally, submit it to the app store.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://spenser.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://spenser.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>spenser.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://spenserapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://spenserapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>spenserapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Class-ify", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Class-ify \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/440/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h3>Created for the Knight Hacks hackathon at UCF.

Its purpose is to provide a social playground for users to submit ideas for conspiracies while attempting to support their claims with use of text and media. This environment essentially becomes the conspiracy lounge for all to build elaborate concepts, which can be done by linking evidence from others conspiracies to create an endless database of incriminating evidence to support the user\u2019s claims. People can then proceed to discuss with the creator and followers of a conspiracy within segmented threads where people can judge the evidence of the creator and provide counter claims or supporting material.</p>\n<p>~~~ Motivation ~~~\nThe motivation of this project was to provide a hub of communication for people who love and enjoy gossiping about life. Coming up with theories, both satirical and factual, generates an environment where users can express opinions which cultivates ideas. This creates a platform where information of past and current events can be discussed in a manner that people would find engaging.</p>\n<p>~~~ Goals ~~~\nLearn and Implement Parse infrastructure for application development.\nSuccessfully start and finish a working prototype of an application for Hackathon\nCreate a social platform for users to voice opinions over theories.\nStrengthen up on database concepts and front-end development implementation\n~~~ Contributors ~~~\nEvan Glazer \u2013 Android Development / Front-End</p>\n<p>William Funk \u2013 Website Creator / Front-End</p>\n<p>Jorge Rodriguez \u2013 Database Design / Content(Dummy-Code) Creator</p>\n<p>~~~ Disclaimer ~~~\nCurrent design implementation of Database was provided to make for easy prototype creation for reaching Hackathon deadline.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oauth\">oauth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/web\">web</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/notepad\">notepad++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yaml</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">avd</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WilliamRADFunk/the-cabal-effect\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/WilliamRADFunk/the-cabal-effect\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the web-based frontend/UI \n+ communication with the frontend and database", "I worked on Database/ Database design and Content filling for the prototype.

Using one of these keywords in your request can help your issue get to the right person to help you out!</p>\n<p>If your issue does not fit into any of the available keywords, use <code>ALL</code> as your keyword.</p>\n<h4><code>.mentor available</code></h4>\n<p>This command just lists the mentors that are available.</p>\n<h4><code>.mentor {keyword} {issue}</code></h4>\n<p>This command will dispatch the bot to select a mentor, set up a private group chat, and set the topic of that group as your issue. Having a clear issue will help the mentor guide you!</p>\n<p>Examples of this command can be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>.mentor javascript How exactly does this callback work?</code></li>\n<li><code>.mentor rails Is there a gem that can automagically generate an admin dashboard?</code></li>\n<li><code>.mentor ALL What do you think of this design?</code></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Mentors</h3>\n<h4><code>.mentor done</code></h4>\n<p>Once you are available again (either by resolving an issue OR passing off the issue), put yourself back in the queue with this command.</p>\n<h3>Admins</h3>\n<h4><code>.mentor add {keyword} {username}</code></h4>\n<p>Need to add a mentor or keyword? Use this!</p>\n<h4><code>.mentor delete {keyword} {username}</code></h4>\n<p>Need to delete a mentor? Use this! (NOTE: use <code>ALL</code> as the keyword in order to delete the mentor from all keywords.)</p>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<h3>Bot API Key</h3>\n<p>You need an API key for your bot. In order for the groups to work, you <em>must</em> not have a bot API key.</p>\n<p>Grab that API key. Save it for the config file in a second.</p>\n<h3>Manually...</h3>\n<p>Clone this repo, make sure you have <code>node</code> and <code>npm</code> installed!</p>\n<p>Edit the <code>package.json</code> with your name.</p>\n<p>Run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies.</p>\n<p>Rename <code>config.sample.js</code> to <code>config.js</code> and edit it with your own config.</p>\n<p>Run <code>node /path/to/bot.js /path/to/config.js</code> to get it running.</p>\n<p>Invite your <code>mentor_request</code> user to your channel!</p>\n<h3>... or with Docker</h3>\n<p>You can also use this with Docker! Update the <code>Dockerfile</code> with your email address.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>docker build -t your-name/mentor-request-bot .\ndocker run -d your-name/mentor-request-bot\n</code></pre>\n<p>Nice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/slack\">slack</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://knight-hacks-2016.slack.com/messages/mentor_request/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://knight-hacks-2016.slack.com/messages/mentor_request/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>knight-hacks-2016.slack.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Open Tab Learn", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Open Tab Learn \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/399/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Open Tab Learn \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/400/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Open Tab Learn \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/401/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Open Tab Learn \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/333/402/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I wanted to build an application that allows people to learn even when they think that they are not learning. By overriding the layout of the default open tab page people will be able to expand their vocabulary in an easy and seamless manner. When a person opens a new tab they are confronted with a word that is considered somewhat hard and its meaning - through this process people are learning even though they don't know it. I built the app by making the files that Google Chrome requires to make a chrome extension , manifest.json , etc. I used html , css ,and javascript. I am proud that this allows people to increase their vocabulary. Before this I never built a chrome extension, so it was interesting learning how to build one. In the future I want to be able to add the functionality of people being able to save words that they are not familiar with or want more practice with and provide a UI to display those words.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
