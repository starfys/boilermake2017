[["WhatsUpDoc", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The primary motivation for development of <strong>WhatsUpDoc</strong> was the existing problem faced by migrants and refugees who do not have access to smartphones and the internet. The refugees around the world are facing a health crisis which impacts not only them but also their families. We wanted to provide the refugees with a simple solution that would try to ameliorate their present condition. After, several sessions of intensive brainstorming over these problems, we realized the lack of access to heathcare information is the central most issue faced by the people in technologically backward areas. We plan to create a tool that would bring basic medical information to the people in need of immediate attention, who otherwise would not have access to the modern medical information. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WhatsUpDoc looks after the modern day client-doctor challenges. Around the world there are a plethora of patients suffering from various ailments. WhatsUpDoc tries to provide an a quick remedy to them. A help in need is a help indeed !</p>\n<p>WhatsUp Doc allows its users to call us (a telephonic call), and we try to solve their problems. The online call (\u201cspeech\u201d) by users is converted to a \u201ctext\u201d using the <strong>Microsoft Azure Speech recognition API</strong>. This text is then used to mine the internet for relevant keywords. Internet helps to offer a quick remedy. We present our users the most prevalent and effective choice. A key point to note here is that this whole process occurs while our users are on-the-call, and an effective tool to connect with users is <strong>Twilio</strong>.</p>\n<p>The information that we target points to the most <em>intelligent</em> (preferred) link on the <strong>Bing</strong>. We use Bing API incorporated with <em>WebMD database</em> to search for the user query. We then used <strong>Machine Learning</strong> to find the most relevant diagnosis corresponding to the caller\u2019s issue . This helps us to refine our search space. We take the most important diagnosis and search it on <strong>Mayoclinic.com</strong> which points us to possible treatments and remedies to the problem. We summarize the data from this webpage by an effective extraction technique which is then converted to speech and read aloud to the caller.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that our technique works in real time. A real time application expects a quick response as one cannot expect user to stay on the call for huge amount of time. To facilitate this task we restrict our summarization results to 150 words, which can be easily outputted in a minute. We present these results back to the user as a speech. Hence, we also perform a text-too-speech recognition task. For this process we have used the Microsoft Speech recognition API. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>After mapping out the program flow and different APIs we wanted to use, we began coding.  First we used Twilio\u2019s API to create a phone call that would convert the user's voice into speech (.wav) file.  We used <strong>HP\u2019s Haven-OnDemand</strong> Text Extractor and Bing API to extract document text from medical databases so that we could have a usable corpus to search for medical terms.   Next, we refined our usage of Bing API and Twilio in order to create a functional product that could communicate and receive feedback from the user.  </p>\n<p>We encountered problems attempting to use HP\u2019s Voice to Speech, and after a significant amount of time attempting to address the long processing times HP\u2019s Voice to Speech, we decided to go with <strong>Microsoft\u2019s Project Oxford</strong> to handle speech to text and text to speech.  Next, we attempted to use HP\u2019s Haven\u2019s Training and Prediction APIs, but due to unforeseen problem\u2019s with Haven\u2019s inability to handle JSON files, and no documentation available that indicated this, we were unable to develop full functionality for this.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We encountered problems attempting to use HP\u2019s Voice to Speech, and after a significant amount of time attempting to address the long processing times HP\u2019s Voice to Speech, we decided to go with Microsoft\u2019s Project Oxford to handle speech to text and text to speech.  Next, we attempted to use HP\u2019s Haven\u2019s Training and Prediction APIs, but due to unforeseen problem\u2019s with Haven\u2019s inability to handle JSON files, and no documentation available that indicated this, we were unable to develop full functionality for this. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>WhatsUpDoc tries to solve the problems of the people who lack adequate resources. We believe on our motto that \u201ca help in need is a help indeed\u201d. Our application is successfully able to map a link between the user query and the instantaneous response. We provide a real time response to the user who calls up through his phone (on a specified number) and gets a quick response to his health issues. To perform this task we do a streamline call handling, speech recognition, speech-to-text conversion, effective multi-level query searching on the internet, efficient text summarization and text-to-speech recognition. All this task occurs while the user is online, on the call, that is real-time.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The first insight while developing such an API is the importance of real-time events. A real-time event requires faster response and highlights the immediate user needs. We also realized the tradeoff0 of the speech-to-text and vice versa communication media. As the size of data increases the performance of these API\u2019s diminishes. We were able to create a simple yet effective summarization API that provides useful insights from the input text. We realized the easily overlooked but highly overwhelming code integration strategies. We believe creating separate modules is one task, but integrating it into a working system is another task, and even more challenging.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WhatsUpDoc</h2>\n<p>We would like to extend our application to incorporate more effective user response. We plan to allow user to respond whether he/she is happy with the remedy suggested by us. A feedback approach will help us to provide client satisfaction. We also plan to perform data mining on the user problems. The mined results can provide an insight that shall help us to categorize the users on the basis of country, state and diseases. Another future scope is to email the users with a comprehensive solution to their problem. Such a mail can act as a guide for the user.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing\">bing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">haven</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/johnward2/bostonhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/johnward2/bostonhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Murdock", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wPLs68OP-kA?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We sought out to solve the navigational problems faced by the blind and visually impaired people.

Fell in love with hacking stuff since then. Had a great time at Boston Hacks, spent 4 hours getting fried chicken with some friends in the area. Lots of swag, lots of food and great prizes! </p>\n<p>Kylie Wu - Sophomore at Columbia University\nI think I can say that I first got interested in technology when I was a young child, while watching my dad tinker with the computer that he put together himself. From that point on, I was curious about learning how computers worked. My experiences at a robotics summer camp, and through my game creation group projects in my high school programming classes only furthered my passion for technology. I guess I can say I\u2019m addicted to solving problems and creating things.\nBoston Hacks was my first hackathon, so I came in not really knowing what to expect or what I wanted to build. I was able to put something together within those 24 hours and saw a bunch of other great projects, so all in all, I had a great time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">havenondemand</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xyz</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://compareme.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://compareme.xyz\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>compareme.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["friend.me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Freshman students in college, people traveling to a new town because of a new job or just on a weekend adventure... Often times, chances are, those people don't know any one in that new town. So the options are Tinder, Hinge...so basically dating Apps...or Meetup which is not very relevant in smaller towns....\nSo we want an app that's simple, location based, and NOT for hooking up.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app matches you to other people around you according to your interests and proximity. It allows you to get in touch and to set up a meeting. And it can suggest restaurants, bars, group activities around you as a possible place to meet.</p>\n<h2>How I built it &amp; Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We initially worked with phonegap... it was interesting and work somewhat. But we had issues connecting easily to a MangoDB database. \nSome others in the group, messed a little with Android Studio, since Java is a language many of us are comfortable with.\nBut ultimately we decided to build a functional \"minimum viable product\" using Swift through XCode.\nAlso, the designer in the group worked with advanced photoshop functionalities. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The final design is what we are the most proud of. We had quite a few variations. Basically we wanted a product that has a similar spirit to Tinder but was with a more innovative design (since the swiping motion has become so common). Using clickable bubbles to represent potential matches positioned using according to geo-distance (see dotted lines), really takes advantage of the bubble chart in displaying pretty much all data collected by the phone &amp; user.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The beauty of teamwork!\nIt's not the end of the world if the initial tool you wanted to used was not the most suitable. Our motto is \"Now we know! Next!\"</p>\n<h2>What's next for friend.me_BostonHacks</h2>\n<p>Using Yelp's API to provide meeting location suggestion according to geo-distance between user and friend match.\nThis will help the app generate money through restaurants, bars, clubs..sponsorship.\nThe next next step if all goes well is having a business version of the app; it would connect the user with his or her LinkedIn contacts while on a biz trip. This version would be subscription based.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mariemayadi/friend.me_BostonHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mariemayadi/friend.me_BostonHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Where Are You", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Where Are You \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/314/872/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Where Are You \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/314/874/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In 2008, when the earthquake hit Sichuan, I feared for the lives of my relatives in China. They live in a province nearby and felt the effects. I remember me and my family worrying and constantly calling relatives in China to check up on them, scared that some of them would be lost. Due to this experience, my team and I came up with an idea to make spreading the notice of missing people and finding people much easier with our web application.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We made an web application that allows people to look for loved ones whom they have been separated from due to a natural disaster of any kind, by simply posting a picture and filling out the full name of the person they are looking for and an email for notifications in the seeker section. Furthermore, our web app also allows someone who has found someone that needs help and they can post their picture, name and email on the website in the savior section and the picture will be cross matched with all the pictures in the seeker database and if there is a match, both party's will be notified.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The front end was made with bootstrap with some editing. Node.Js was used to deploy a quick server and Kairo API was used for the facial recognition.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>JavaScript was a pain to use. \nThe time constraint.

The problem with these large displays is that they consume an excessive amount of power to display a slow changing graph. We sought to create an energy efficient alternative method for financial companies to display the data they need.</p>\n<h2>What it does/How it Works</h2>\n<p>The setup is a dry erase board with two stepper motors attached to the two upper corners. Fishing wires are attach to the motors via a machined pulley, and attached to the other end to a piece of plastic. The plastic acts as the mount to the dry erase marker, whose motions can be controlled by the motors. Stock market data obtained from the Market on Demand API, or personal accounting balances obtained from the Capital One Enterprise API in real time is converted to a coordinate system and sent to the Arduino to power the stepper motors and move the dry erase marker to the next point in the plot. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Much of the time was spent on making sense of the math behind the coordinate system. In the beginning, we got very jittery, unstable movement from the motors, and spent a lot of time calibrating the motors to work together perfectly. We are able to now get smooth, straight lines in the bottom half of the board, but because we're first years and fell asleep trying to learn multivariable calculus, lines plotted on the top half of the board are still imperfect.</p>\n<p>A few hours before pitch time, we accidentally blew the fuse in our circuit board and broke both our stepping motor drivers. We had only one backup. Luckily, we had enough resources to build our own stepping motor driver on a breadboard. </p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>Thank you to the mentors from Mitre and Capital One for their immense help. Thanks to the lovely volunteers for their encouragement throughout the night and providing an endless supply of candy and coffee.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Dry Erase Plotter</h2>\n<p>The plotter can be used for a magnitude of other applications. For example, small businesses can use the plotter to plot income trends, and hackathons can use it to plot trends such as social media engagement or total hacks. Because of the small footprint, our plotter can be left on for days with very little energy consumption. It can also be scaled up easily; a large dry erase display will use the same mechanisms and the same amount of energy consumption.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">capital-one-enterprise</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/capital-one\">capital-one</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">market-on-demand</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on data retrieval from web APIs and transformed it into plot-able coordinates.", "Worked on the math involved in calculating the motion on the plotter and helped with Arduino.", "Created the perfboard layout and soldered it together.

We are really close friends who like talking to one another, but we didn't like to leave Skype connection open between all of us the whole time. It would be good if we just have a tool where we can talk to one another whenever we need to just by pushing one button. With this tool that we build, talking to close friends is easier that we have ever imagined!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TipTalk allows users to easily connect with their peers through voice communication. Users have their own landing page where they can see whether their friends are online in realtime (i.e. see instantly when a friend comes online or goes offline). If a friend is online, users can send a voice message in walky-talky manner by holding a particular key of the keyboard (or pressing the screen in case of phone) and speak.</p>\n<p>Unlike other voice-communication platforms like Skype or Google Hangouts, TipTalk aims to reduce frictions in voice communication. It's way easier to communicate via TipTalk with multiple your friends concurrently, as you do not need to commit to one particular call.</p>\n<p>TipTalk works in various platforms, including Destop clients (OSX, Windows, Linux) and major mobile platforms (Android, iOS) although mobiles apps are not full-featured yet.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We use web technology to power our project. For the desktop client, we use <a href=\"http://electron.atom.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Electron</a> we a wrapper, and utilize <a href=\"peerjs.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">PeerJS</a> (WebRTC) as core library for voice communication. For server side, we use Express.js with PostgreSQL, hosted on DigitalOcean. On the mobile, both Android and iOS, we use Cordova.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting webrtc to work on iOS is a litle tricky. We couldn\u2019t find any library that surely support WebRTC until pretty late in the game, and it\u2019s on Cordova. We decided to use Ionic framework for mobile app, and javascript + jQuery for the desktop electron app. We decided to finish the desktop app first, and reuse the code from there. However, the framework difference prevented a lot of code reuse. A lot of refactoring happened, and it slowed down the mobile development process by a lot, to the point that we couldn\u2019t finish the mobile app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It is the first time that we use Electron to build a desktop app. So far, we are extremely satisfied with it. With the tremendous amount of productivity that it allows us to do, we accomplished the impossible (for us). It is, with no doubt, the best thing we have built in the 24 hours time frame so far. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to decide on tradeoffs. We were pushing towards native development, but we realized that incorporating WebRTC like that is too time consuming, and thus decided on Cordova instead. We also learned that the attention to little details on front-end development can improve the user experience quite significantly. On the other hand, this was pretty much the first time we used electron and we learned that this is definitely a go-to place to develop desktop application.</p>\n<h2>What's next for tiptalk</h2>\n<p>We really need to push this project forward to the next step. Within the 24 hours of hackathon, we have built a <strong>fully working prototype</strong>, that will allow us to test with real world use. We know that this app has a lot of potential, and we are not going to let it go.</p>\n<h2>Video Demo</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://screencast.com/t/ste8mtHsor\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://screencast.com/t/ste8mtHsor</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/smiled0g/taptalk-electron\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/smiled0g/taptalk-electron\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on desktop app, and color design.", "I worked on the UI Design and mobile cordova app.", "Backend"]], ["ChatTime", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Communication is an essential human connection and that should not be taken away from anyone</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Uses the Google Camera API combined with Microsoft Azure Speech and Face APIs to provide real time translation of someone talking into visible text</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>With the dream of equality and potential.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning how to program Android apps</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Works very well</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The power of good APIs</p>\n<h2>What's next for ChatTime</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-speech-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-face-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sejinkwon10/boston_hacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sejinkwon10/boston_hacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["ScareBear", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://github.com/mrmarss/ScareBear.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/mrmarss/ScareBear.git</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["The BH Jukebox", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The BH Jukebox \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/315/234/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>The BH Jukebox</h2>\n<p>We wanted to create a new way to <strong>experience music.</strong> With the advent of the Oculus Rift and Unity, the team aimed to create an interactive and immersive environment to visualize music. </p>\n<p>The team comprises of three members: Edward Luo, Erwin Wang, and Johnson Chen.

After that is entered, the lock on top of the ignition key is locked. When the user is intoxicated and returns to the car, he/she must blow into a breathalyzer attached to the lock, and if the user is drunk, the lock will not unlock. Instead, the user will be given the option to text a friend or call an Uber. If the person does not have service, a text is sent through wifi using the twilio API.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The lock itself was made using arduino uno, a temperature sensor (in lieu of not being able to find a breathalyzer, works exactly the same way though), and coded in C. The application was made using Java and Android Studio. Firebase was used to store user information, and along with node.js, express.js and Microsoft Azure, a web service was created to send a text through Wi-fi.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Since we didn't have an alcohol sensor, breathalyzer, or barometer, we substituted for a temperature sensor. Although this provided us with similar values (relatively) as the other sensors would, calibrating it and getting accurate readings became difficult. Tasks that seemed simple became relatively complex. Also, we didn't know how an arduino would share data with an android, so learning that was a challenge. Furthermore, we were not very experienced with ember.js and server side coding so it became a fun, but difficult challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Overall, we are all very proud of what we have accomplished.We were not afraid to ask for help, and thus learned a lot. We were also not discouraged by the fact that we were not able to find the ideal sensors. Through a lot of struggles and tribulations, we were finally able to create a product we are proud of  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned not to become frustrated, as some complex problems are actually simpler than they look.

were inspired by the idea of using computer vision to convert hand gestures to language. Although we originally wanted to do sign language, we realized the scope of this would take too long for twenty four hours. Therefore, we decided to focus on hand gestures made with the Latin alphabet. We were also inspired by the blackboard themed tables at BostonHacks.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is an online blackboard. Using a Microsoft Kinect, this application will track the hand movements of a person. It will then keep track of the coordinates, draw a picture of the coordinates, and then convert this picture to text using Computer Vision. It then displays this text and allows the user to save it, along with a variety of other options. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used C# to work with the Kinect, and Node.js for the server side, client side Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the front end, Tesseract for the computer vision OCR, and GraphicsMagick for drawing the picture from the coordinates.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We wanted to do sign language originally, this was difficult to accomplish. We found that the Kinect was not always accurate with drawing the letters and it would sometimes jump around. We also found that Tesseract wasn't 100% accurate either. We tried to teach Tesseract with ML so that its image recognition would improve, and we decreased computer usage and improved our algorithm so that the Kinect could better recognize images.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We think that this is a good project to have made in twenty four hours considering the fact that we had no experience with C#, CV, Kinect or ML before. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a large amount about working with hardware, computer vision, and machine learning. </p>\n<h2>What's next for KinectYourBlackboard</h2>\n<p>We would like to pursue this design further so that it can work with fingertip depth recognition so that writing can be quicker and more efficient. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tesseract\">tesseract</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">graphicsmagick</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ejs\">ejs</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/erschwartz/Kinect-Your-Blacboard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/erschwartz/Kinect-Your-Blacboard\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["NextGenTheremin", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NextGenTheremin \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/315/919/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>NextGenTheremin</h1>\n<p>A Theremin for the 21st century</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We choose to ~go to the moon~ <em>make a theremin</em> in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are ~hard~ <em>reasonably challenging</em>, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to ~win~ <em>learn from</em>, and the others, too.\n      - (mostly) John F.

LeapMotion</h2>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong> \nThe four of us learned to use an entirely new API in the span of this 24 hour hackathon and completed our first hardware hack. </p>\n<p><strong>The Accomplishment</strong> \nWhile the game certainly isn't perfect, it's definitely functional, with 3 different types of hand motions required to interact and play the game. We even managed to put in a little joke whenever you uncover a mine!</p>\n<p><strong>How To Play</strong></p>\n<p>Well, you're obviously going to need a LeapMotion. But if you have one, here's how you can play!</p>\n<p>There are three different types of motions required to play the game: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>To reveal what's behind a square, hover your right hand on the square and move it in a circle, being careful not to uncover more than one!</li>\n<li>To disarm a mine, hover your right hand over the tile you want to disarm and push your left index finger in towards the screen (this is called 'screen tapping'-- but don't actually touch the screen!) Note that you only have 13 'defuse kits' and 11 bombs to defuse. Use these kits sparingly. </li>\n<li>Once a mine is disarmed, you'll be able to uncover the tile safely. There will be an 'X' where the mine once was. </li>\n<li>If you try and disarm a tile that is not a mine you will lose one of your disarm kits. Once you're out of these kits and you still have mines to defuse, you will lose.</li>\n<li>This is all about speed- the game will let you know how long you took to finish after you've either lost or won the game. Remember that being slow to defuse all the bombs makes you a lot less cool. \n\n<ul>\n<li>Have fun!</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>always remember: beware the trump</em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mantaleigh/BostonHacks_Minesweeper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mantaleigh/BostonHacks_Minesweeper\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Drinkmate", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Drinkmate \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/315/000/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Even when adults become parents, alcohol should not be compromised as a part of being a parent.

We wanted to play a role in a cause to help prevent car accidents, and potentially save the lives of many drivers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The SmartWheel utilizes a hand-crafted steering wheel with LED lights to indicate whether a driver has correct or poor driving habits based on how they handle the wheel. It also detects if a driver is drunk through the use of Microsoft Azure's Machine Learning service which calculates with a 90% accuracy if a driver is drunk. SmartWheel also uses a driving simulator to display how well a driver is doing on the road and also engage the driver in a realistic experience so they are prepared for the real world! The purpose is to correct the bad habits a driver may have through a safe simulation and prevent accidents from happening through practice.</p>\n<h2>How (WE) built it</h2>\n<p>We used a lot of cardboard (soylent boxes &lt;3) to create the physical steering wheel. The wheel itself was hand crafted and cut with precision to replicate that of an actual car steering wheel. It was duct taped for comfortability and we taped LED lights on the rim to help give driver feedback. This wheel was attached to another soylent box and put on a tilted level for ease of steering wheel use. The steering wheel was attached to a servo which was attached to an Arduino, which we use to find the changes in the steering wheel angles.</p>\n<p>Next we used the Unity Game Engine platform to make a simulation. We first created a normal car game that moves with arrow keys. Then we used Serialimport to link the Arduino output to the Unity game input which allowed for steering wheel to game interaction. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Unity bugs were absurd.

Ideally we would use the info to find ideal locations to put Wind turbines around people's homes but the data from NOAA isn't the most accurate. We built our own weather sensor to track data about wind direction and speed and would sell this devise to users.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There is some embarrassed time when waiter comes to your table with all of you friends having trouble splitting the bill. There are also some restaurants (authentic Chinese probably) that only allow one credit card swipe per table. The card swiper has to spend about 10 minutes to manually figure out who eats which dish listed on the bill. And even though dishes are allocated correctly, it is barely possible to charge each person's tax and tips fairly. </p>\n<p>Now it's the time to relax. Introducing our BostonHacks project Splitter! With little effort typing your dishes into this app, every person is able to figure out how much he/she should pay exactly.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We support an \"one card swiper/multiple members\" mechanism. Whenever the card swiper creates a session, each group member will type in the invitation code as key to get into the same group. Each group member only has to type dishes he soloed, and the card swiper needs an extra step to type in all shared dishes and corresponding prices into our App. What's more, we also allow each member to remove those \"shared dishes\" that he/she did not participated in. </p>\n<p>After the card swiper added the tax and tips, he will press the \"Split\" button at the bottom of screen, and each member will receive their personal bill with tax and tips included. </p>\n<p>Here is a link of our high-resolution Splitter diagram: <a href=\"http://baizhima.github.io/documents/hackbu/diagram.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a></p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our application is backed by Parse. This BaaS service saves us tons of time writing a backend server for this application, and we developers can put most of our time designing data models and decorating user interfaces.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As junior iOS developers, our team has only limited knowledge in Cocoa Touch classes and Swift syntax. We think the hardest part to fully understand is Auto-Layout. After some struggled time finding online resources, our team finally decided not to support all sized iPhones in this alpha version release. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Applied what I learned from Database and Computer Network courses into real projects. Server-client intercommunication, non-blocking I/O, E-R database design pattern and even more...</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p><strong>Trust your teammates</strong>. Our team is formed by 2 Brown Computer Science graduate students as developers and 1 RISD grad student as main designer. As a team of three, all of us have to shoulder much more than our given title. Our designer not only drafted all views user interfaces but also gave useful suggestion on the whole application logic. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Splitter</h2>\n<p>We've already added Venmo icon at the payment detail view, indicating that in the next iteration we will support making payments through Venmo's iOS SDK.</p>\n<h2>How to run</h2>\n<p>Please run this App in an iPhone 6/simulator(4.7 inches).

Also, I didn't have enough time and could not do the front-end of the application very well.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning how to build an android app. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to build an android application. </p>\n<h2>What's next for ACBGM</h2>\n<p>Edit the sound files so that the music can be played seamlessly for the entire time, Put in random footsteps/shop noises so that it is more realistic, UI with settings such as version of animal crossing the background music should come from.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Casper", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Casper \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/314/624/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Casper \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/314/625/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Casper \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/314/626/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Setting multiple alarms every morning can be a pain, but a majority of college students do it anyway. Whether we've got an early morning test, a job interview, or just a class that we don't want to miss, we often stagger anywhere from five to fifteen alarms to make sure we wake up in the morning. If we could change that, we would change the lives of millions of college students.</p>\n<p>But we can't. So instead, we decided to automate the process with an app called Casper. Our application takes two inputs\u2013when you want to start trying to wake up, and when you must absolutely be awake\u2013and staggers up to fifteen alarms guaranteed to wake you up. Early alarms use a soft ringtone and are spaced far apart, while the later alarms blare loudly and come one after another. Users can opt-in to verifying their alertness by inputting a passcode to cancel the alarms.</p>\n<p>We're also working on haptic feedback via the Apple Watch. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple-watch</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/roguePanda/casper\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/roguePanda/casper\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Backend algorithm for alarm scheduling and graphics.", "I worked on alarm scheduling and a bit of notifications, parts of the API I hadn't really seen before.", ""]], ["ReplyGenius", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ReplyGenius \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/314/818/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>After struggling to do a simple, single task with Twilio, I decided it would be very helpful if there were an expanded version of the Twilio.org Rapid Response Kit available - A tool that allows users to use the Twilio API to accomplish simple tasks - no coding required.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ReplyGenius at it's core, is an entire easy-to-use framework for Twilio integrations.
