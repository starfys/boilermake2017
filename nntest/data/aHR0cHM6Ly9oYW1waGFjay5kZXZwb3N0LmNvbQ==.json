</div>\n<div>\n<h1>MuseInvader</h1>\n<p>MuseInvader is a space invader game you play with your mind! Using the MUSE headband, beta waves can be detected and used for movement. </p>\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n<p>Beta waves are often associated with active, busy, or anxious thinking and active concentration, this is used to propel your ship to the right. When the player wants to move to the left, they just simply must quiet their mind and relax. To fire bullets at the incoming enemies, the player simply blink their eyes. The MUSE SDK offers a very easy way to detect eye blinks.</p>\n<h2>Game Design</h2>\n<p>The game's design is intended to be very relaxing and non-stressful. There is no end goal and there is no lose state, however there is a point system. This allows the player to focus solely on practicing their movement and accuracy while feeling a sense of progression. </p>\n<p>The game offers both a co-op mode and a duel mode for 2 players! Two MUSE headbands are needed for this gamemode. The co-op mode functions the same as single player, except it has two ships controlled by each player. Duel mode is a 1v1 where the players go against each other to try to hit eachother. In duel mode, there is no death state and no end goal, just like single player. Each player has a 'shots hit' score so players have a progressive goal to compete against, but don't have to stress to much about losing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kotlin</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/libgdx\">libgdx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hypereddie/MuseInvader\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hypereddie/MuseInvader\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I pretty much made the entire thing, with the exception of libraries and sdk's used"]], ["trend-vironment", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"trend-vironment \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/124/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Data page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"trend-vironment \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/125/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Trend-vironment</h1>\n<h2>HampHack 2016 Project</h2>\n<h3>Premise</h3>\n<p>Trend-vironment is an environmental sustainability web-app where the user can choose a category from a list of the most relevant issues with the environment today, along with a start date and an end date.

Faced with the daunting complexity of the system, we are often left dazed and confused. We feel like there cannot possibly be a way for us to comprehend, much less change the world around us. But that is not the case. Each one of us has the responsibility and power to shape the environment for future generations. Thus, we were led to create Phyto, an app that delivers and contextualizes the relevant environmental news to the user, helping them understand the world and empowering them to make a change.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Phyto delivers the environmental news that matters to you.</strong> The goal is to deliver articles that are personally relevant to each user. Based on the user's inputted preferences and location, we use Intellico's Machine Learning AI to find the most engaging content. Though changing the environment requires global cooperation, it is motivating to hear about local issues and how to change them.</p>\n<p><strong>Phyto helps you understand the environment.</strong> Simply delivering the news is not enough. While a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/27/12107.full.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus of 97% of international scientists</a> agree on the need to act now against climate change, only <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/key-data-points/environment-energy-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">54% of Americans list it as a top priority</a>. Why is there such a disparity? Because the way news is delivered is conflicting, partisan, and ultimately, confusing. Phyto helps you get around that by providing clear supplementary resources to the results.</p>\n<p><strong>Phyto empowers you to change the world.</strong> Phyto arms you with the information to fix the environmental problems in your area. With our mobile app, we deliver the best methods for users to better the environment.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We took a two-pronged approach to Phyto, creating both a web site as well as a mobile Android app. This combines the two approaches of changing the environment.</p>\n<p>After we brainstormed the idea during dinner, Willie constructed our website with Sinatra, a web application framework written in Ruby. The Indico.io framework was seamlessly integrated into our code to deliver accurate web results. I mainly worked on the frontend, where I used the HAML template language to quickly deploy our web site with Bootstrap. </p>\n<p><strong>From Nirmal</strong>\nWe were coding the Android side to Phyto. For a long time, development lagged, but we got this amazing idea quite late at 9am and then we got down to work. We had to create a server with a python, which we had just started learning, along with its web framework Django, and on the client side, we also needed to create an Android App version of it. I built the foundation of both the front-end and back-end while Nirajan fleshed out the features.</p>\n<p>We kinda kept going, and this morning at 9am, the idea popped up on our discussion which was to come up with something that is alluring, and with this attraction, we can send important global warming messages around indirectly. It was an idea of saving money, that everyone loves doing so, and at the same time, they are saving the environment! \nRemove\nRemove\nRemove</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of our biggest challenges was deciding how to help the user understand the news. At first, we sought to visualize the data with tag clouds, with Leap Motion integration to fully immerse the user. However, this proved to be both difficult to program and difficult to understand. Having the words swirl around in a circle was not enlightening for the user and we ultimately scrapped it for our tree-based model.</p>\n<p><strong>From Nirmal</strong>\nHaving to learn new technology and to implement it, it was hard and frustrating not being able to get answers and having to search for a while. It was pretty stressful in that sense, as the time was limited! But it was fun.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud that I only slept two hours this whole time. I was really surprised by how fun the hackathon made the time feel!</p>\n<p>As it was my first hackathon, in the early hours I was discouraged. My code wasn't working, my team was trailblazing, and I had nothing working to speak for. However, as the time passed, I discovered I was learning and could contribute to the project in my own way. I am proud to stand behind this product we developed.</p>\n<p><strong>From Nirmal</strong>\nComing out with an idea in late hours and and then building upon it in limited time was something that we are proud of. I also learned how to manage time quite properly.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Over the time, I learned in a trial by fire a litany of tools (node.js, indico.io, Leap Motion, ruby, jade, haml, bootstrap, Unity). Although most of my attempts failed, I was able to discover tools that could do what I want. I also learned a lot by talking to people about everything from teamwork and entrepreneurship to life.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Phyto</h2>\n<p>We seek to further integrate the two Phyto apps. By more intricately connecting our two interfaces, we can enable further environmental change. Also, we will expand the topic of our news apps to different fields. Finally, it may be promising to work with Indico.io to further their machine learning capabilities. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">haml</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">url</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nyanfly/phyto\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nyanfly/phyto\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["GeoNotes", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of our roommates supplied us with the idea, which we thought was a neat service for people to use.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It lets the user leave notes wherever they are located, and also read notes left by other people.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Android SDK to develop the mobile application.

Cell phones and other electronic items contain high amounts of precious metals like gold or silver. Americans dump phones containing over $60 million in gold/silver every year. However, less than 15% of these appliances are properly recycled. Many appliances that are recycled are exported to foreign countries rather than properly recycled. It takes 530 lbs of fossil fuel, 48 lbs of chemicals, and 1.5 tons of water to manufacture one computer and monitor! </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>eWaste incentives people to donate their appliances at dropboxes at local schools. By doing so, they earn points that they get cashed in for rewards to benefit the high school students. Meanwhile, these electronic appliances are sorted and the ones that are still functional or can be refurbished get resold (especially in international markets) while the junk appliances are disassembled for the precious materials, which gets resold to manufacturers.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using Xcode( Apple's IDE) and Swift (Apple's Language)</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Making the app simple yet functional.\nHow to incentivize people to recycle their electronics</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Building the app from scratch without too much experience in iOS programming.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>eWaste is a huge problem for an environment.

The 3 of us were discussing what we wanted to build for this hackathon and each member had one major thing they wanted to work on. One girl wanted to create something people could use, another wanted to create a game and the last wanted to do something related to education. The initial idea was to create 3D-based interactive game that allowed kids to learn about physics. After arriving at the hackathon, we opted to change our subject to environmental awareness to relate more directly to the hackathon's themes.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This game is similar in structure to Roller Coaster Tycoon(a popular computer game that allows users to build and manage a theme park). Players are given a piece of forest and are instructed to maintain its health (displayed in a corner bar). The forest contains 2 types of trees (pines and oaks) and deer (depicted by the cubes).   </p>\n<p>The player's forest is threatened by man-made and natural disasters and the player can help avert these disasters by answering multiple choice questions. Correct answers stop the calamity and give the players points to help develop their forests into an ecologically healthy environment. Incorrect answers cause the disaster to remain and thus. decrement the health of the environment. </p>\n<p>The player wins the game when their health percentage reaches 100% and they lose when the percentage reaches 0%.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The project was largely built with the help of the Unity3D Game Development Platform. Our scripting language of choice was C# because it has many similarities to Java, a language we are all comfortable with. The 2 Windows' members wrote their scripts on the VisualStudio IDE and the 1 OSX member coded with the aid of the MonoDevelopment IDE. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Perhaps out biggest challenge was climbing over the learning curve. None of us have had any experience with game development or the languages we used. Our major breakthroughs did not come until the later part of the hackathon because we were spending out so much time trying to fix the most trivial issues. </p>\n<p>One main challenge we ran into was object disappearance. The member who chose to create the graphics spent a lot of time trying to determine the best way to make objects 'disappear' when forest health decreased.   </p>\n<p>Another major challenge we dealt with was formatting Unity's GUI options. The buttons didn't always format the way we wanted them to. Our game requires many buttons and clicks so making sure every item was properly connected to the required items involved a lot of careful coding and, in some cases, lots of debugging. </p>\n<p>The randomized timer was also not easy to work with. One member spent several hours trying to figure how to program and where to place the randomization in order to create questions to gain points. </p>\n<p>Lastly, we found integration of individual components to be difficult. When we tried to push our copies of the project to GitHub (an attempt at simple integration), the game components wouldn't get copied over along with the scripts. We eventually wound up resolving this issue the old-fashioned way: by copying and pasting code directly into one member's machine. Code was transmitted over USB. </p>\n<p>There were plenty of challenges, but we found some way or another around them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are mostly proud of climbing over the learning curve. Our game, though perhaps not the most technically or artistically complex game, it is still one easy to maneuver with working components and 3D images that make sense.  </p>\n<p>Each member is also proud of the individual challenges she resolved in her portion of the code. Whether we were succeeding in overcoming graphics issues or randomized timer issues, each girl had her own reasons to feel accomplished throughout the course of this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Along with learning how to use a new platform, a new scripting language and new IDES, we also learned about different environmental issues and how to effectively code in a very strict time frame. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Forest Tycoon</h2>\n<p>We are interested in developing the forest environment to display more environmental effects on the forest as a cause by humans. We would like to develop the overall graphics and plot of the game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">unity-3d-framework</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/monodevelop\">monodevelop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">monodev</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["MuSyC", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MuSyC \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/181/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Starting off; building the first circuit.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MuSyC \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/179/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The real \"back end.\"</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MuSyC \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/178/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Making the template for our box.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MuSyC \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/180/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Drilling to make holes for the wiring.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MuSyC \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/186/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>MuSyC, looking snappy.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MuSyC \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/354/237/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Melting the plastic so that it can be bent into the box.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>MuSyC is a project which aims at building a music to colour synaesthesia visualizer.</p>\n<p>Synaesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which perception of a certain stimulus, such as the musical note \u2018A\u2019, involuntarily elicits another seemingly unrelated sensation, such as seeing the colour red. There are various types of synaesthesia, one of the most common of which is music to colour associations. However, explaining the qualia or feeling this cross-sensory activation elicits is hard to do \u2013 thankfully, music visualizers have made it easier to showcase how sound can influence and shape images. It's often difficult for people with synaesthesia to explain their condition to others. Plus, it is a visually interesting idea that makes beautiful art.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MuSyC - Music, Synesthesia, and Color- emulates the neurological condition of visual-audio synesthesia. It can be used to educate people on the condition as a form of neuroscience public outreach, help music students learn to read sheet music and it's fun, cute performance art. Importantly, this device can also provide a visual stimulus to promote accessibility - during orchestras and concerts which would provide an alternative visual stimulus for deaf or hard of hearing individuals.</p>\n<p>Our goal with MuSyC is to make a device which is sensitive to the frequency or pitch of a sound and flashes certain colours in response to amplitude and frequency. Not only will this device allow non-synaesthetes to experience the world and music from the eyes of a music-colour synaesthete, it has great potential to be used as a tool for performance art in collaboration with musical orchestras and bands. Moreover, we hope that this device can also be used as an educational tool for those beginning training in music and those who need an additional visual cue to help distinguishing between closely related notes as well as become an aid in learning sheet music. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Adafruit Arduinos to build the MuSyC. We also used Neopixel LED rings to provide the visual stimulus and an Ampli-Mic for detecting audio input. Cassiel and Kyoko had never heard of Arduino before the hackathon and then proceeded to learn the language in less than 14 hours each. We also took advantage of the fabrication studio by building a black plexiglass encasing for the circuit, Arduino Uno board and other wiring. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We learned the arduino language on the spot. We also had difficulty with hardware connectivity and performance - especially with detection of aural stimuli.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of having learned a language in 24 hours. We're proud of never having built an LED microphone circuit to a circuit with two LEDs, a microphone, and a potentiometer. And we achieved our grand idea from the start. This project has the potential to help music teachers, hard of hearing individuals who love music, synaesthetes, musicians who are aiming to expand their performance into a visual format and neuroscientists.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned a lot about circuits, hardware, and maker space. We also learned the power of patience and persistence.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MuSyC</h2>\n<p>We would love to make MuSyC a wearable, as was our original plan. We had to use a larger arduino than we planned because of connectivity issues, but if we could get the smaller arduino to work we could make goggles, neck ties and other wearables. This way a musician could be wearing one of these devices while playing an instrument, thus delivering a real time translation of their music into visual stimuli. Imagine an orchestra full of people with these devices!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adafruit\">adafruit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neopixel</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://musyc2016.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://musyc2016.wordpress.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>musyc2016.wordpress.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I learned how to use the arduino language and found the methods that allowed us to access volume and pitch as well as assign colors.
