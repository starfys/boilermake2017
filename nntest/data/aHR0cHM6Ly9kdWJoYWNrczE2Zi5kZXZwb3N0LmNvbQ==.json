[["Rooky - A Chrome Extension for Phobias & PTSD", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It can be difficult to handle issues of PTSD, phobias and online harassment when surfing the web since a user's mere noticing the content can cause lasting damage. Here we felt a browser add-on could serve a valuable role by filtering content based on a user's unique triggers or by filtering general harassment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The add-on currently runs in one of two modes. The first mode attempts to combat general online harassment using a list of keywords (with respective scores) to determine whether page sub-elements ought be hidden or not. The second mode takes input from a user regarding a 'custom filter' and filters relevant images and text content.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first built functionality that scanned a page and blocked relevant text content. Secondly, we built a tool which analyzed images on the pages on-demand using Clarafai as well as a list of keywords to block user-specified visual content. Finally, we used a Thesaurus API to take the user's initial custom filter keyword and expand it to similar words (say a user blocks 'spider', they might also want to block 'arachnid' and other similar words).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning how to create a chrome add-on had a steep learning curve at first since no one in our group was very familiar with the technology at first. Additionally, we found it harder than we anticipated to maintain browser speed while also analyzing the page content.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We accomplished our initial goal of having a thorough filter tool as well as our stretch goal of analyzing visual material. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Most tools, via either help from mentors or online documentation, aren't necessarily as daunting as they might initially seem. Additionally, we learned a lot about Chrome Extensions as well as a small bit about Clarif.ai.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rooky - A Chrome Extension for Phobias &amp; PTSD</h2>\n<p>Flesh out personalization features (allow users to choose how strict the filter is), additionally make the filtering process more visually appealing. Finally, we found that some of the code we wrote would be usable in creating a smarter \"Find\" feature on a browser (by looking for similar words to the one you're looking for. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">clarafai</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mashape\">mashape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neabburi/rooky/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neabburi/rooky/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>homes.cs.washington.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was the Integration Engineer, connecting the JavaScript files we created into one program.", "I worked on developing the filtering part of the extension, as well as building the website.

The user can submit a url as an sms message, all the processing is done on the backend, and the server returns a pure text representation of the webpage. Pure SMS for the end user! </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Twilio's API was critical to get the interface up and running quickly, it allowed super simple messaging services. The backend is entirely python running in flask deployed on AWS. Right now user sessions are just stored in flask, but we built and deployed a MYSQL database that we are hoping to use to improve the scalability/user experience when we get the chance. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges of this project was parsing and displaying a menu from a webpage.

However, we felt that the UW Campus Map was sorely missing some key features that could have helped it reach a much higher potential for use and impact.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dubmaps.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">DUBMAPS</a> is a great way to visualize the massive amounts of data for classes and events on campus. Users can use DUBMAPS to see where classes take place and estimate building usage during different times of the day. They may also upload a screenshot of their class schedule and find out immediately where their classes are located. UW Admins can also use the tool to get statistics on UW classes and buildings, allowing for things such as risk management, emergency planning, or classroom placement logistics. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We scraped the UW Time Schedule to get data on classes as well as the UW Calendar for events and which buildings they were in. This data was parsed into a JSON file structure and linked to the front end which was built using Leaflet, MapBox and the map tiles from the UW campus map. We then hard coded each building\u2019s three character code to the latitude longitude coordinates (as buildings are unlikely to move). Image recognition and uploading was handled through Imgur's image upload API endpoint and Microsoft's Cognitive Computer Vision service, which parsed the image for course data. We then fed the course data JSON back into the front-end to be presented to the user on the map. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Ask us!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to coordinate well and had a great work pipeline, allowing up to accomplish a lot without excessive organization overhead. Everyone was always busy implementing new features, and every updated master branch was always a treat to pull and checkout. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned about new tools, handled the time-pressure of our ambitious project, and taught each other valuable skills in new areas along the way. Furthermore, many of us gained a lot of valuable experience coding with a local team, and working together to move towards every new goal.</p>\n<h2>What's next for DUBMAPS</h2>\n<p>We hope to get access to the Student Web Services so that we can streamline the data gathering and improve its accuracy by not having to use a Web Crawler to scrape data. Having access to the UW Building API would also be extremely useful to be able to present more useful information in data visualization and analysis. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapbox\">mapbox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dubmaps.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.dubmaps.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dubmaps.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked as the Full-Stack developer, leading back-end decisions and implementations.

Currently, the hearing-impaired community uses a vibrating wristband as alarms, which is both intrusive and uncomfortable for sleep. We found that blue light helps wake people up, which is why we chose blue LEDs for this project. We also want it to be foolproof, so we implemented Clarifai's computer vision API to confirm that the user is awake.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When the alarm goes off, blue lights turn on that mimic the color of the sky, telling light receptors in the user's eyes that it is time to wake up. The clock also uses computer vision to allow a user to dismiss the alarm with a thumbs-up gesture in front of their computer.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it with Java, C++ and Python. On the hardware side, we drive the LEDs with an Arduino, and used a Raspberry Pi as server to run our algorithms. We used the built-in cameras on our laptop to implement computer vision since we do not have a discrete camera module.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We found communications between the computer, Raspberry Pi and Arduino to be challenging since they are connected over Wifi and Serial. We also had to train the Clarifai API to recognize a human face with thumbs up. On the hardware side, we had to solver wires and LEDs, while also designing a 3d-printed case for the LED module.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We used 3 languages-- Java, C++ and Python. We also implemented a machine learning algorithm using Clarifai's API. We also have TCP over Wifi using the Socket library, and serial connection to the Arduino working, which was challenging. While software projects are cool, getting software and hardware to work together is a step above for us.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Coming into this, we were only proficient in Java, but now we also know Python and C++. It is also our first time implementing an API. We learned that some problems are easier to solve when consulting people with different backgrounds. Last but definitely not least, we learned to be inclusive for people who are different from us.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Blu Vision</h2>\n<p>Since the algorithms are run on the Raspberry Pi and not our individual computers, the whole project is independent and could be easily transferred to another user. Because of that, we could also easily implement other UIs such as iOS, Android or Web instead of Java.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked more on the hardware side, and soldered wires and LEDs.

Due to HoloLen's lacking strong support for Unity's mature HTTP request libraries, we spent 8+ hours alone on hacking HoloLen's HTTP Request service to upstream the detected faces to the Microsoft Cognitive API.\nEventually finding a lone Japanese developer's code randomly posted on an obscure forum, we were able to resolve this hurdle.</li>\n<li>After resolving the HTTP Request issues involving Unity and HoloLens, to support the Microsoft Cognitive API and our FireBase Database, JSON serialization and encoding in Unity proved to be a huge pain as there seriously lacked compatible APIs that would run Unity's software and on HoloLens hardware.

With both the Google Vision API, Microsoft's Cognitive Services, and Clarifai's APIs only providing basic sentiment analysis with simple emotions such as \"Sadness\", \"Happiness\" and the like, we had to quickly look into other solutions to implement a \"confused student\" detector. At first we didn't understand the problem at a technical level and tried implementing a KNearestNeighbors algorithm to determine separate clusters between \"confused\" and \"attentive\" students, we quickly identified our misunderstanding and successfully implemented an accurate and low-CPU intensive Decision Tree algorithm in Sci-Learn instead. </li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li> We had to first mine Google Image search for sample training data for both thousands of \"confused\" faces, and many more thousands of \"non-confused\" faces.</li>\n<li>After scraping with JS, downloading with Python, and then upserting and extracting enhanced metadata via Microsoft's Cognitive API we could differentiate from the 1-dimensional sentiment data of to feed into a decision tree.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-hololens\">microsoft-hololens</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sci-learn</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">decision-trees</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">k-nearest-neighbors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">azure-virtual-machines</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">web-scraping</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joseph-zhong/DubHacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joseph-zhong/DubHacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tarikm2/VisualTA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tarikm2/VisualTA\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Software/Tech Stack Architecture, Backend Flask, ML, JS Data-mining Scraping, SciLearn, Firebase\n", "AR Design, Web Design, Full-Stack Web Development", " ML Algorithm designing & implementation", "HoloLens Dev working on Integrating CV and use of device camera, sending communicating with Microsoft Cognitive and ML Algorithm, and visualizing results."]], ["EyeSafe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As someone with an elderly grandmother, I was concerned that she wouldn't be safe.

We're excited to see the impact our product makes!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The browser extension primarily communicates with our Python backend hosted on Amazon's Elastic Computer Cloud. When the user enables tagging, the text is parsed and tagged as different parts of speech by the server. using Microsoft Cognitive Services' Linguistics Analysis. This text is coloured based on what type of word it is.</p>\n<p>For images in the article, we generate a caption for each image on the page by merging the results from the Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API, as well as Clarifai.</p>\n<p>A summary is generated for each page with a self-written, graph-based, extractive summarization algorithm. We apply PageRank on a complete graph with vertex distance being the cosine similarity of the tf-idf vectorizations of two sentences. The result is the three sentences that are most central to the entire document.</p>\n<p>The Chrome Text-To-Speech engine is used to enable users to listen to the article, instead of having to actually read the page themselves.</p>\n<p>The reading speed is calculated for each page where tagging is enabled, and this data is saved locally. This allows detailed reports of reading speeds to be generated, including how a learner may have improved over time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was quite a challenge to make all of these parts work together. The project originally started as just a text coloring service, but we thought of more ideas that would make the web more accessible as we hacked. Especially since some features could only be implemented on the backend, and some could only be implemented on the frontend, it made our hack quite complex, but we are very proud of our achievement.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The coolest feature that we think that we implemented was the text coloring. In order to achieve this, we had to parse the HTML DOM and apply styles to all the visible text. Along the same lines, we also had to find all images and edit the DOM to add captions and tags.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about all the various resources we used - in fact, it was our first time using most of these APIs and frameworks! But each time, we were surprised and excited about how easy and hassle-free they were to use. We think that this was a great experience for us to be exposed to all these different services during a great hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What's next for cmpr</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Colourblind modes for parts of speech tagging</li>\n<li>More advanced data visualization</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chart-js\">chart.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rapidapi\">rapidapi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awoopa/cmpr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/awoopa/cmpr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I primarily worked on the front end Chrome extension, data collection, and graphing, and design.", "I worked on the backend, which included the POS tagging, image analysis and the summarization algorithm.", ""]], ["RemiBot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RemiBot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/920/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RemiBot \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/740/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RemiBot \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/741/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RemiBot \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/743/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>The goal behind RemiBot is to establish a non-overt way for users to become more self-aware of trends in their mental well-being.

Another thing that most of us did not experience in high school is the feeling of constantly being broke for food. Those are both pretty serious issues for us. Therefore, we came up with the idea of \"Up for Grab,\" an app for lonely individuals to avoid eating alone and save money at the same time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Suppose UserA made extra food he wants to share with others. He posts information about it (including a picture, a description, how many servings, time, if it\u2019s charged and etc. ) on Up for Grabs to people nearby. UserB and UserC both see the post and want the food. They can both send requests to go, however, UserA can decide whether to decline or accept their requests based on their profiles. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We had a very long group discussion at the very beginning of Dubhacks. We brainstormed everyone\u2019s problems and interests, and decided to try to solve a common problem for college freshmen: being broke and lonely. We decided to build an app in Java with SQL. The IDE we used is Netbeans, we also, of course, used Github. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since we are all inexperienced freshmen, none of us have ever built any apps. At first, we could not figure out how to work on the same project at the same time. We wasted a lot of time on that. Also, most of us have never used Netbeans before, it took a while for us to get comfortable with it. Other challenges we ran into includes exhaustion and unfamiliarity among teammates. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We stayed in a room with three other teams, and we are definitely the newbies in the room. We were intimidate. But after a few hours,  people started giving up. Even though we still are not sure if our program will run successfully at the end, we never gave up. We tried our best and created something we actually wanted to build, and we actually like what we are building! </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Time management is one of the deciding factors when it comes to teamwork. Because of lack of experience, we wasted a lot of time trying to work with each other and arguing about duties in the first half of DubHacks. We saw a significant increase in our efficiency as a team in the second half. We learned how to work with others. Also, of course, we learned that building something new can be really frustrating and doesn\u2019t always work out the way you want it to. But things tend to work out (hopefully).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Up for Grabs</h2>\n<p>We had a few ideas that we wanted to try out but never got the time to. Here are a few of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keyword Search/ Machine Learning\nWith the help of API and some knowledge about Machine Learning, we want the app to pick up descriptions for the images and label the images by it self. </li>\n<li>Favorite Chief/ Comment or rate posts\nAfter using this app for a while, people will get familiar with each other and therefore there might be some \u201ccommunity chiefs.\u201d People should be able to follow the chiefs they like and see what they\u2019ve been doing. </li>\n<li>Private Chats/ Group Chats/ Private Posts\nAs stated in the last point, after people get familiar with each other, people need a platform to communicate in a more efficient way. </li>\n<li>Online Connection to Banks\nAfter the app gains popularity, paying in cash might be a pain. Some sort of online payment method should be linked to it. </li>\n<li>Recipes for Popular Dishes</li>\n<li>Safety problem caused by real-time location</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/netbeans\">netbeans</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/siyukw/Dubhacks1.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/siyukw/Dubhacks1.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["SongQ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAfv03cQibU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SongQ \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/678/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Chat</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SongQ \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/679/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Suggestions</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SongQ \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/680/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Now Playing</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SongQ \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/685/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Vote</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you ever been to a party where no one can decide on the playlist? Songs keep getting skipped as people vie for music dominance? Never again! SongQ aims to be your ultimate party companion. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SongQ queues up your songs in a calm and orderly fashion. It connects to YouTube's music so it can be used for playlists or for YouTube parties where you want to show off your dank memes. Every time a song is played, people can suggest a song to be voted on next and vote for the next played song. If no suggestions are made or no votes are cast, the next song in YouTubes autoplay plays. But the only thing missing from this sweet rager is the pizza! You can also use our voting system to decide which pizza toppings to order for the group. You can also chat with your fellow partygoers. Decide when to vote on the pizza, tell the Prius owner to quit blocking your car in. You can chat about anything with SongQ.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Youtube Data API to search for Youtube videos. The webserver is Express running on NodeJS. We used Socket.IO for asynchronous communication between the server and all of the clients.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Originally, we wanted to use the Spotify API to queue up the songs. We ran into a problem because Spotify couldn't send us back any information from the player, so there was no way of determining when the song was over. So we couldn't start up another round of voting. We had had the idea of integrating YouTube videos into this when we started, so we figured we might as well use it for the music anyway as it has a good selection of music and might have songs that Spotify doesn't have access to. \nFormatting was a bit challenging between the mobile platform and the desktop. Creating the page elements for the phone screen from the desktop didn't always go smoothly. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We finished both the MVP of the song queue system, as well as one of our stretch goals (the pizza voter). We definitely had more features we'd like to have added, but we were proud that we accomplished so much in this time. We also collaborated very well as a team. We enjoyed working with each other even though we didn't all know each other before this event. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned more about the Spotify and YouTube APIs and how they integrate with webapps. We also learned more about how hackathons work and how to work quickly in a time crunch. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SongQ</h2>\n<p>We have lots of ideas for future integration. We could use the pizza decider to also split the pizza bill. You could use the phone's NFC to pay cover charge for the party. Or you could upload selfies to vote for the best Halloween costumes! We also want to expand the song suggestion algorithm. We want it to be able to learn from every party and  math its unique vibe. This has lots of potential for expansion and monetization. We hope to be able to continue this project beyond this hackathon and see how far we can take it. :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/youtube\">youtube</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Lookabout", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Lookabout \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/842/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Image of our application.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to develop for a population that has difficulty seeing their immediate surroundings.

We were inspired by presentations of recent innovations in AI technologies that we believed could be used to further this goal.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using image recognition and text-to-speech, our app allows our users to recognize nearby points of interest, such as benches, signs, and storefronts. Users listen to a synthesized voice that identifies and describes key objects, people, and landmarks and around them using Clarifai and Google Places APIs. With the phone in close proximity to the body (such as in a shirt pocket), photos are taken with the camera in short intervals. These photos are analyzed by Clarifai to distinguish what\u2019s in front of them, and the view is described by Android\u2019s text-to-speech engine. Using this same data, Google Places searches for landmarks related to Clarifai\u2019s tags.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Built it in Android Studio using Java. Uses a custom Camera class that takes images every 5 seconds, and uploads images to the Clarifai API. Clarifai to identify an object using tags to read out with text-to-speech. The Google Places API is used to find landmark names near a user's location that match Clarifai's prediction output.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We struggled with creating a camera class that would take images every 5 seconds, without interrupting the applications normal functionality. We worked to integrate multiple APIs into a single product and learned how the different API outputs can be formatted and used.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating an Android app using Clarifai that can identify objects and using text-to-speech to respond to certain images by reading in tags from Clarifai.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Elisabeth: I learned the android development workflow, starting from nothing and working up to Gradle and JSON, as well as extreme perseverance and patience.</p>\n<p>Sam: It was my first Android development experience.

Our idea is to expose these children to various career paths with everyday items that are familiar to them. These children may have seen these items before, but through the hololens and our program they will have the chance to see these items in a new light with endless possibility for their future. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user (a child) can tap on objects using the Hololens e.g - a slice of cake, a kitten, a guitar, firehose etc. and people in those professions will appear. These professionals will briefly explain what they do, what they love about their job, and how they got to where they are.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We installed Visual Studio, HoloLens Emulator and Unity3D on our Surface Book. We checked the Assets Store for characters and humanoids; and prepared audio recordings for them. We then programmed Hololens in C# and developed gesture recognition techniques to make the humanoids appear; and a timer to make them disappear again.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was our first exposure with HoloLens and Unity and figuring out implements such as gesture, tap, spatial sound etc provided a good sized learning curve. Also, HoloLens has certain hardware requirements and the Emulator could run on only one of our systems. We ran into multiple software complications throughout the night from setting up our environment to figuring out how to implement our project while trying to stay positive and believe in ourselves and our collective ability.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We all were able to learn new skills associated with new technologies and work together to create a successful proof of concept. We came together as strangers and quickly became a team and even friends. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about the Unity Platform, the Hololens emulator and majority of us used Visual Studio for the first time. We also learned about the importance of sticking together as a team and approaching a problem as a cohesive group. Communication was also a key component to the overall experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CareerLens</h2>\n<p>We aim to partner with organizations like Disney, Microsoft and Khan Academy to launch educational programs for all youth in the United States and beyond. This would help them make an informed choice on potential career opportunities and help improve their own futures as well as their local community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NalaniKai/HoloLens.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NalaniKai/HoloLens.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Project management, worked with Unity, Visual Studio and C# languages and brainstorming ", "Hackathon!

When brainstorming how to innovate this highly complex process, we thought of how we might automate certain aspects of the process. </p>\n<p>This lead us to realize that ech time there is a traffic stop, the officer asks for the same information: Driver\u2019s License, Registration, and Insurance. Since this information is such a standard request, it is a no-brainer to our team that this information gathering should be an automated process. </p>\n<p>After speaking with multiple officers, the atomization of this step of the process is not only feasible, but is also much needed. This inspired us to pursue the development of such a software system during Dubhacks 2016. </p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>The PullOver software will increase safety for both officers and citizens by simplifying the average traffic stop. </p>\n<p>During a normal traffic stop, the officer will make two separate trips to the citizen\u2019s vehicle. During the first trip, the officer asks for registration, drivers license, and insurance. During the second trip, the officer returns these documents and issues the citizen a ticket or warning. </p>\n<p>We wish to eliminate the need for the first trip; allowing the officer to quickly move on to the second trip. We will do this by giving the citizen the ability to upload their license, registration and insurance on to the PullOver system. Once these documents are on the system, they will be easily accessible to the officer on site via a connection between the citizen\u2019s smartphone and the officer\u2019s laptop. The citizen\u2019s information will be verified by the DOL and will be regulated in order to insure that it is up-to-date. </p>\n<p>At a high level, this is how we plan on eliminating the first trip that the officer makes. Once that trip is eliminated, the officer only needs to make one trip to the citizen\u2019s vehicle (in order to issue a ticket or warning). Using the PullOver system, half of the face-to-face interaction is avoided and this will increase efficiency as well as decrease the probability of an altercation.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We use React Native to create a native app that can easily be scaled to support all major smartphone operating systems. In 20 hours we were able to code a prototype, wire it to our real-time database, and deploy it to a physical test device with encouraging success. There is a lot of work to go, namely the implementation of a real-time video exchange to establish friendly rapport between both parties, as well as provide the officer with critical visibility into the suspect vehicle interior, without placing either party in an uncomfortable or dangerous situation. Twilio Video and VoxImplant are potential candidates.</p>\n<p>For data persistence we rely on Firebase Database. We <strong>do not</strong> make use of Firebase Authentication for drivers. Instead, we incorporate salted SHA256 and AES encryption for sensitive data, while leaving more general fields such as ethnicity and traffic stop data as plaintext. That's correct: the entire database is anonymized and made 100% available for public oversight as an innate property of its design. Firebase Auth is still used for officers, who need access to driver information without restriction.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many different challenges conceptualizing and developing Pullover. When we came together as a team, we had a constructive discussion on the values and vision of our project. This was a crucial part of the process which usually drives the direction of the project. Coming together on a consensus while focusing on the main, high level outcome was a unique challenge which was achieved though excellent collaboration and communication from all team members. Another main challenge was developing the logistical framework for the application service. Knowing our application would be used by police departments and co-exist within government agencies, we needed to know how we would safely and securely access and distribute sensitive information, map out both civilian facing, and officer facing app, while working in a highly regulated field. Because our app aims to reduce a high stress, high stakes situation, we had to be very cautious of identifying unintended consequences of application functions. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are incredibly proud of developing an idea that has a direct social impact, which we as a team feel deeply passionate about. Within the technical realm, we honed in on a specific vision, mission, and detailed SWOT, projecting for future on the co-design end. Our development of the app was very satisfying as we developed a functional native iOS and Android application, which can be installed and demoed.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>During our time here, we learned about the ideation, product specification, and software development process, as well as the challenges of working on projects that rely on the cooperation of third parties. Since PullOver would be used in high risk situations and at a governmental level, we had to regularly consider security implications and regulation compliance. Despite the challenge of having to work with different partners and sets of information systems, we wanted to persist on working towards a solution for a problem we hold passion for.</p>\n<h2>What's Next For PullOver</h2>\n<p>The next steps for PullOver will be honing in on feasibility questions, and understanding how the existing information systems and technology works for things like criminal records, driver\u2019s registration information, and in-car hardware for police officers. We would like to engage in more user research to understand the values and realities of the stakeholders in this space, as well as a technical understanding of how we can implement PullOver best.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/brentschroeter/DubHacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gitlab.com/brentschroeter/DubHacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gitlab.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Women in STEM", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the design and spirit of the techiesproject and we also believe that increasing the number of women who take STEM subjects to be an important cause</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Provides a resource for women who might be interested in pursuing a STEM major.

Although building a border wall between Mexico and the United States has been proposed as a solution to illegal immigration, the notion comes mostly from misconceptions and negative sentiment surrounding unauthorized immigrants. We wanted to create a solution that would help bridge that gap of misinformation regarding immigration and help others gain a better understanding on the lives of undocumented immigrants and the difficulties of illegal immigration that many people don\u2019t know.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our solution is a game called \u201cBuild a Wall\u201d that is meant to educate its users about immigration through statistics, facts, and testimonials to better understand the problems that many undocumented immigrants face. The game involves the player building a wall: each round, the player can set a row of bricks that will spawn an informational pop-up about illegal immigration. After a certain number of rounds, the player can choose to either break down the wall or continue to build it and choose their own ending.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For this project, we used Figma, a prototyping and wireframing app similar to Sketch in order to create a storyboard layout of the game.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Because our group consisted of people who were better with UX, design, and some front-end web development but not so much back-end dev, the prospect of developing a working prototype game in 24 hours was quite slim. Therefore we decided to play to our strengths and focus especially on the design of the game by using Figma and pen-to-paper techniques to flesh out how the game should look and behave.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of coming up with an interesting, novel idea and working to ideate a decent story and premise. Collaborating and thinking together to try and create a cohesive narrative and layout for the game was a challenge, but when we came up with a great story beat or quirk that fit the nature of the game, it felt like puzzle pieces fitting neatly together in line. Best of all, we worked with our strengths rather than focusing on our weaker points for a great project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that even with our limitations, a hackathon is definitely a place where people can come together to network, meet new people, and learn new things to better improve the coding and designing experience. Challenges are welcomed, and overcoming those challenges is a feeling like no other. We also learned much through research on illegal immigration that we didn\u2019t know before.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Build A Wall</h2>\n<p>Bettering our back-end development or collaborating with others who are more experienced in game design could be a great way to physically actualize our game into a reality. We\u2019d also like to consider additional end-game features for the future, like implementing data visualization to show how other users responded and performed in the game as a whole.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">figma</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/KMByIye8rfQRdlGvKYGGhzDP/Build-the-Wall\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.figma.com/file/KMByIye8rfQRdlGvKYGGhzDP/Build-the-Wall\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.figma.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ocf47UGu4rKRT_Zr7u959yW5badZSngNmaiv9g41cWo/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ocf47UGu4rKRT_Zr7u959yW5badZSngNmaiv9g41cWo/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["SnapTrash", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The hordes of trash at this hackathon inspired us to promote eco-friendliness. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Take a picture of trash, find out if its for recycling, compost, or landfill.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Built on 2 platforms: Android and Web.

I was firsts inspired with an article I saw about how many cell phones who call 911 don't automatically send their locations which could mean the difference between life and death. Taking that, along with the idea that images could not only help in justice situations but also as a method of explanation, I wanted to make sure that callers could send images to the dispatchers. When taking pictures, you hold the phone away from your face, and I considered the situation where it would be dangerous to use speakerphone while calling 911 and advanced the idea of a more visual interface. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>My plan was that this app could be used as a simple way to get to a 911 operator. It could be used as a normal call, it could be put on speaker phone, and the Google Cloud Speech API would be used to take the operator's audio to text on the screen. The Google Cloud Vision API could take the images that the caller would be able to take and add tags that, along with manual sorting into categories, would allow the dispatcher to more easily organize assistance. After the emergency, the caller would be able to review the call and add more tags or adjust a comment they had. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>From a sketch on a napkin, I then made a paper prototype that I made into an interactive piece with POP. I then used Illustrator to make individual screens and uploaded them to Invision where I was able to string screens together and create a more realistic UI. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I started this at around 4 in the morning and was working alone. There weren't too many technical things I ran into, but time and lack of viable iterations led to a lesser project. I wanted to do a whole lot more, and so that was a little frustrating. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of the idea because I believe that, if more thought out and with more resources invested, it could prove very helpful for individuals in noise-sensitive situations and individuals who cannot viably speak to an operator.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Its a bit more fun to do the process with someone else, but its really rewarding to create a prototype in 12 hours all by myself. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Silent Savior</h2>\n<p>I really think that this could be a life saver in situations like mass shooters, domestic violence, hostage situations, and any emergency situations with deaf or hard of hearing individuals. I would love to work more with this idea to develop it to fruition and produce a product that could be used to help people in many situations.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">invision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://invis.io/VQ8YV8V74\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://invis.io/VQ8YV8V74\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>invis.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I ideated, designed, prototyped, and wire-framed this project on my own.

Even after multiple mentor inputs, integrating all the features we wanted into a working prototype needed a little more time than we had in hand. Hence, we decided to move to Step 2. Creating a desktop application. The application mirrors the same features and usability of the web app. Our present prototype uses Java for it's back end infrastructure and Swing as it's GUI with a MySQL database working alongside.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We faced some integration difficulties with Angular, Node.js and MySQL initially that for some reason refused to transfer and translate the data we were looking for. However, this was just a minor setback as we weren't dissuaded and quickly implemented all the functionalities into a desktop application. Although we were not absolutely confident about Swing as a GUI option, we worked hard on the final interface being as user friendly as possible.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are really proud of our idea and of the fact that it was really well-received with the mentors. We also feel happy that even though we had issues with the web app, we got the desktop app up and running. In addition, we're really proud that we were able to utilize all our resources properly and our skills to come up with a working interface. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt a lot about how MEAN Stack works and a lot more about Web Development languages like JSON, XML, Angular and Node.js for backend infrastructure. In addition, this project provided us with the opportunity to learn about really cool integration and web development platforms. We're literally getting out of this with so much more than we had imagined. Not just a cool project but also a new way of approaching web application development! </p>\n<h2>What's next for Cardless</h2>\n<p>Cardless has multiple possible uses. The prospects of this idea are massive. We are basically planning on taking card and payment privacy into a more secure and more user friendly arena. We plan on creating a really interactive web application that will be transferred into a mobile( Android and Apple) application that can be accessed from everywhere. Cardless has the prospects of being a world wide payment option that reduces the risk of losing your debit card information to potential hackers. The information is privy to just you and your bank but you can use it to pay wherever you want.

Each and every quarter the task consists of going over a list of classes already taken, making a list of classes needed, and then writing down each and every class\u2019s meeting times in an effort to create at a schedule of non-conflicting classes. For students taking a full course load this process can take up to a couple of hours to complete. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, \u201cIn fall the fall of 2016, some 20.5 million students are expected to attend American colleges and universities\u201d If each student spends 2 hours on their schedule it equates to over 112,329 hours being spent each day.

We thought about how it can be difficult for those with depression to get up and start their day. They may lack motivation to plan, get up, or do what others may consider 'normal' throughout the day.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app offers one coping skill/activity for the user to try out every day. Once they have completed the activity, they can choose if they liked it or not. This data then goes into a radar chart plotting what category (physical, social, or mental) the user enjoys the most, as well as storing which activities the user enjoys. The app also prompts the user to choose how they feel at the beginning and end of the day. This data is stored and goes into a double line graph. The user can access both visualizations and the list of favorite activities.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We started off ideating by talking about different ideas. We decided on one idea and started sketching an information flow. We then used adobe XD to create a prototype of this app. We also tried to create an android app using java (see challenges).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a team of 5, with 3 designers and 2 programmers. However, both of our programmers had no experience creating an android app. So they learned how to program an android app during the hackathon. We also ran into the problem of how to complete user research in such a short time. To compensate, we created an app that allows the user to choose what works for them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we created a product that used all of our skills to the best of our abilities.

Some of us went in with a handful of friends, but trying to integrate yourself into such a massive community is overwhelming regardless. Despite the incredibly diverse range of RSOs and other on-campus activities happening daily, there is currently no truly effective way to figure out what is happening on campus today that might be relevant to you.</p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>Dub Cal helps curb this problem.</p>\n<p>Dub Cal takes event information from Facebook, the UW Calendar, list servs, and manual input to create a cohesive and interactive student calendar. Students can check out RSOs and events based on their interests, searching from suggested topics such as music and arts to more specific suggestion by user input. The application allows students to see how close they are to an event going on at that very moment, and who is already at the event. Here, we\u2019re hoping to promote a sense of community and togetherness that can often feel difficult at a large-scale university.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Designed a fully-normalized, relational database, hosted on AWS RDS services running on MySQL.  Stores users, RSO groups, events, and the relationships between these entities.\nImplemented an interface in Python to abstract interactions with the database using SQLAlchemy module.\nUsed the Facebook public API to pull down data for RSO groups on Facebook and write it to our database\nSet up an AWS server that serves HTML via Django.  Server also hosts our database interface for data access, allowing the rendering code to read and write information about events and how people interact with them</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a series of challenges while working this weekend. One of our primary difficulties was the front-end development. With three people talented in back-end, one who works in UI, and a PM, we had almost all of the pieces necessary for putting together a special project: except for a front-end developer. The coordination between UI and back-end can be difficult on a tight schedule, so we struggled to get something fully functional on the back side and interactive on the front side that looked like our initial vision.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of the fact that we have multiple elements to show off this piece. With a case study video, an interactive InVision prototype, and the backend all completely fleshed out for our mobile-responsive site, we worked on three elements that came together to show what we hoped to create.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how great it is working in a team together, for one. Regardless of the outcome of the project and this weekend, working as a group of five was a terrific learning experience. We all learned a little from each other all weekend, Natalie (UI design) and Tom (PM) about the coding aspect and John, Colin, and Novin about the app idea and design.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Dub Cal</h2>\n<p>In terms of what\u2019s next for us, we would love to fully get this product together and running with the backend work and the UI designs to be a service that students could use. As seniors and juniors all attending UW, we all know how difficult it can be to get involved and find something you\u2019re passionate about while attempting to find friends. This app, even after this weekend and the work we\u2019ve done here, is something we hope to continue on as we see its merits for the larger UW community and incoming freshman. In terms of the competitive analysis bit, while a UW Events app does currently exist and others have attempted to create similar systems, this is the only application to provide real-time feedback on what events are currently happening, who is there, and in general how to sort through all of the RSOs and events on campus.

No one in our group was fluent with JavaScript, but with enough caffeine and motivation (and google) we were able to get a proof of concept prototype up and running.</p>\n<h2>Purpose</h2>\n<p>ReConsiderate is a Google Extension that aimed to reduce online harassment. </p>\n<p>ReConsiderate analyzes text that user input (via email, social media, etc) and when the message seems to carry a negative connotation toward others, a message will pop up to remind the user to reflect on the meaning of the message and whether this is the message that they would like to be delivered. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Cloud Natural Language API</a> is used to evaluate the structure and meaning of the text that user inputted and it will provide a sentiment score between the range of -1.0 and 1.0. </p>\n<p><img data-canonical-url=\"http://images.flatworldknowledge.com/wrenchorgcomm-27115/wrenchorgcomm-27115-fig094.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--w9Av7mlf--/http://images.flatworldknowledge.com/wrenchorgcomm-27115/wrenchorgcomm-27115-fig094.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Sentiment score near the -1.0 range indicates text that may deliver negative (harassment, hurtful, harmful, etc.) feelings toward their audience while sentiment score near the 1.0 range reflects texts that create positive (excitement, joy, etc.) meanings. </p>\n<p>When ReConsiderate detects texts with sentiment score near -1.0, it will create an alert (via message) for the user to confirm whether this is the type of message that they would like to be delivered. </p>\n<p>ReConsiderate acts as a mediator by delivering positives notes that will allow the user to reflect on the text that was inputted. Overtime, this will hopefully change the way user interacts via social media as ReConsiderate is perpetually running in the background, analyzing the text that user inputted and moreover providing a feedback based on sentiment scores in hope of reducing the amount of cyber harassment that is happening. </p>\n<h2>Team Members</h2>\n<p>Our team is comprised of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/midoriww\" rel=\"nofollow\">@midoriww</a> - UWB Software Engineering Student (Midori Williams)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jcruz8482\" rel=\"nofollow\">@jwcruz8482</a> - UW Computer Engineering Student (Jeremy Cruz)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/beckychan92\" rel=\"nofollow\">@beckychan92</a> - UC Berkeley (Becky Chan)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/azoni\" rel=\"nofollow\">@Azoni</a> - UWT Student (Charlton Smith)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NeelMohapatra\" rel=\"nofollow\">@NeelMohapatra</a> - UWT Student (Swojit Mohapatra)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Technologies</h2>\n<p><img data-canonical-url=\"https://www.twilio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01-digital_google_cloud_platform_logo_lockup-01-1.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--NRtNeo7T--/https://www.twilio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/01-digital_google_cloud_platform_logo_lockup-01-1.png\"/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Cloud Natural Language API</a></p>\n<h2>Chrome Extension Icon</h2>\n<p><img data-canonical-url=\"http://blog.draperinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Thinking_Face_Emoji.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--G5upe6B1--/http://blog.draperinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Thinking_Face_Emoji.png\"/></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-cloud-natural-language-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/beckychan92/reConsiderate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/beckychan92/reConsiderate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the write-up as well as the UX component for reConsiderate.

With the desire to work on a fun project, we decided to utilize Clarifai and Spotify APIs for this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We created a website called MusicalPics that can be accessed on both a computer and on mobile. MusicalPics allows the user to take or choose a picture to be uploaded on the website. A list of songs are recommended based on the visuals within the picture and the user is able to randomize and play a song with an embedded Spotify player.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this project using javascript, html, css, Spotify's API, Clarifai's API, and Github. Once it is uploaded, Clarifai analyzes and tags the image. The tags are then filtered into Spotify's API where songs are chosen based on the similarities of their titles.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A challenge we encountered was integrating Clarifai with the website due to difficulties with authenticating credentials. Another problem was, instead of a URL, it could not analyze and tag images that were stored in a local file on a computer. The main and major challenge of this hackathon was having to alter our original plan from using a video, to having to use an image because no matter how long we debugged, we simply could not figure it out..</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The main accomplishment was being able to upload, connect, and tag a local image using Clarifai. We were also very happy to have connected the tags with similar songs from Spotify and having a working prototype by the end of the day!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The main learning takeaways was how to accurately use Clarifai and Spotify APIs, and integrating them with a website.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MusicalPics</h2>\n<p>In the future, it would be great to be able to tag the visuals from a YouTube video and create more specific, customizable tags for the user's images.

By changing the genes inside of a cell, you can program it to do novel and useful functions that it otherwise could not. Cellular immunotherapy, the newest hope in cancer treatment, is a example of the rising important of synthetic biology in our lives. </p>\n<p>Our team is composed of bioengineers, biochemists, and hackers who care about expanding STEM knowledge to all those who are interested in it. Learning how to build genetically modified organisms isn't so tough-- high school and college teams compete in synthetic biology \"hacking\" events such as iGEM the same way hackers compete in Dubhacks. For many, it's how they discover their love for biology and engineering. However, without the resources of a laboratory, mentors, and funding, there is no way for most interested students to find out what synthetic biology is. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Playsmid is an interactive way to dive into the basics of synthetic biology design without ever having to pick up a pipette or put on a lab coat. By teaching synthetic biology logic through a game, even those with no biology knowledge can start learning how to make their own novel organisms.</p>\n<p>Playsmid models the process of designing and integrating a plasmid (circular piece of DNA) to engineer yeast cells. The puzzles included in Playsmid allow you to build up your knowledge in synthetic biology-- Begin with simple color outputs and advance into detecting and amplifying molecular signals. </p>\n<p>If you are a researcher or educator, you can add your own repository of genetic parts to our crowdsourced database and show students how to build strains in a engaging, visual format. Playsmid is your genetic playground!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Playsmid</h2>\n<p>We want to build a sandbox mode with a larger repository of genetic parts.

By scanning from a camera, making an inventory of ingredients is easy and fast!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We use Clarifai's Image Recognition API to identify ingredients and query our Azure backend with the list of ingredients to get a recipe. The backend is powered by Node.js and works with Azure SQL Databases to give back possible dishes given the ingredients.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A lot of the problem spaces we placed ourselves in were new to us.

Kristy specifically learned about how UI and layout works in Android while working on the apps presentation. Tremaine learned more about version control when we used it in our project along with working with APIs like the Clarifai api and our internal api.</p>\n<p>The back end team (Derek and Riley) learned a lot about the how out of control callbacks can get in Node.js and also how to work with cloud services like Azure. Derek also learned Javascript and SQL for the first time today too.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Clarifood</h2>\n<p>The next steps for Clarifood are to connect to commercial recipe databases. This will allow us to provide many more recipes and matches to our users. Also, by adding an account system, we can provide some cool features for the users.\nFeatures we had in mind when we were brainstorming this project are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Associate dietary restrictions and nutritional goals to the user to provide specialized recipes and dish ideas.</li>\n<li>Add suggestions to be able to buy additional ingredients from nearby stores. We could suggest ingredients that are in season since they'll be cheap and healthy.</li>\n<li>Corrections for ingredient classification.

It's impossible to wrap our heads around humongous code bases and how to build them. Even understanding what issues need to be solved and what features need to implemented is a challenging task. We wanted to make it easier for developers, designers and managers to contribute to open source projects. They could learn how to solve code issues and respond to specs, in turn, learning how to contribute to bigger code bases, develop software and learn how big organizations work. This would not only hone their skills but also help the open source community grow faster. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Stakeholders of open source projects can register their repositories on our service. We scan their repositories for issues and related tags. We then provide a comfortable environment for developers to find specs in their areas of interest or skill. We also encourage repo managers to design welcoming specs and readmes for newcomers. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The entire service was centered around popular javascript frameworks. The server side was built in Node and Express with the complete server and the database on AWS EC2 instance. We used Jade for front end development. We also used MongoDB to store details about users, repositories and issues. We extensively used the github api and the rapid api to get relevant data, label it, and share with our users.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning new technologies. Deciding between sql and no-sql databases. Having to distribute work between 4 people and also make sure to work as efficiently as possible. Moreover, we had to figure out the various api calls for github and read through many documents and specifications for all our technologies.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Building an entire service in one night that has most of the structure we set out to build. An entire server side in node and express, writing front end code in Jade that none of us had used before. Utilizing databases and setting up APIs was pretty challenging as well. Also, wrapping text in CSS is a lot harder than it sounds.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we like sleep a lot more than we think we do. Secondly, the importance of skills outside just writing code. A lot of things like user research, product design and management skills play a huge role in the success and fulfillment of a project. Quite often we were going to the whiteboard discussing over and over again what we wanted to build. </p>\n<h2>What's next for OpenAid</h2>\n<p>Making a more extensive and friendlier environment for open source development would be a great start. One of the features we were most excited about was peer review of code. Snippets of code would be reviewed by volunteers and stakeholders well before they would be finally merged and published. This would not only ensure higher quality code for projects but would also serve as a learning platform for developers who want to contribute to the open source community.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rapidapi\">rapidapi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oauth\">oauth</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://52.88.54.48:4000/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://52.88.54.48:4000/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>52.88.54.48</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["WorkoutTracker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Incredibly sophisticated phone sensors are underutilized.\nReal-time workout data is motivational.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Uses the phone's gyroscope to track rotational velocity.

Yeah :D\nProof of concept: the rep-counting ended up being pretty accurate.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to use the Android UI setup and AndroidPlot.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WorkoutTracker</h2>\n<p>Adding better support for linear workouts (pull-ups, bench presses, etc.) using accelerometer data. The gyroscope approach is best suited to rotational workouts (curls, squats, where your arm/upper leg is rotating). Also, more importantly, saving workout data and tracking trends over time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">androidplot</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/veksarev/dubhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/veksarev/dubhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Collaborated together on almost everything.

When adding new features, I would get a very detailed specification from a UX designer, and then I would have to essentially re-do his work by programming that interface using Xcode and Swift. After doing that, I could start adding functionality, but first I would usually spend hours going back and forth with the UX designer about little details I might have missed, like a screen component being off by a couple pixels or using the wrong color/font size for text. I decided that there must be a simpler and more efficient way for UX designers and programmers to work together to create iOS applications.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>iDesign is a tool that allows UX designers to design iOS applications so that they look exactly as intended. By using a simple drag-and-drop interface, they can add UX components to the screen in the exact location and size they desire and specify other component information such as corner radius. Then, the programmer needs to add only two lines of information about the class and iDesign will auto-generate Swift code that produces the view and scales it to all iPhone screen sizes (iPhone 5 and later). This makes the programmer's job a lot easier because he/she only has to make sure the app functions exactly as intended, without having to worry about how it looks.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built it the old-fashioned way using Swift and Xcode. If I could build it again, I would just use iDesign to auto-generate  about 1/3rd of the total lines of code for the app!</p>\n<p>I integrated some of Apple's APIs such as an image picker and sharing pop-up but did not integrate 3rd-party APIs because I didn't have time after coding up the views and the code generation algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>My entire team abandoned me! This meant I had to cut some features, such as additional component specification and a backend to allow for easier data storage and sharing between UX designers and developers. Ironically, one teammate who was a novice at iOS programming left because he had too much trouble visualizing the screen as he was coding it - a problem that iDesign fixes!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of myself for not giving up and writing all of the code alone when I was planning to have the help of 3 people. Additionally, I'm very proud of the finished product because although it's not as feature-heavy as I would have liked, it's functional and people can actually use it to generate Swift code for their projects.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that I'm capable of doing a lot in one day! I also learned how to use more of Apple's classes such as UITextField, UIPanGestureRecognizer, and UIImagePickerController. Lastly, I learned that UX design is difficult; although this is a UX design app, I think the UX is the worst part of the app!</p>\n<h2>What's next for iDesign</h2>\n<p>I plan to add additional features to iDesign such as more robust error handling, accounts/sharing, and additional component specification options. I will use iDesign to generate code for my other Swift projects, and may even publish it after ironing out more of the kinks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kennanmell/dubhacks-16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kennanmell/dubhacks-16\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Circle", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/591/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>mockup</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/592/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>mockup</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/593/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>mockup</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/594/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>mockup</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/595/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>mockup</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/602/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Ideation</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/603/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Databasing</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Circle \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/604/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sitemap</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The team at Circle was inspired by trying to find allow people to find a support community online.

However, not everybody has the time/convenience to go and physically meet up with other people to hang out and watch a show. This inspired us to make a product that would make it more convenient for people to share music and videos. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web application allows users to synchronously listen to music and watch videos in real-time with their friends/family/colleagues. Users create rooms in which a group of people can all join and vote for the next video to play from a recommended list as well as nominate their own videos. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the web application with MEAN, which includes AngularJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB. We also incorporated the Youtube API for access to media, Socket.io for real-time communication and we deployed our application with AWS and EC2.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a big issue with copyright. Youtube does not allow 3rd party applications to freely stream restricted media content. This was a big problem because we weren't allowed to stream music from VEVO or WMG. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to finish a fully functioning, deployed release of our web application on our custom domain.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt a lot about playing with APIs and the strengths/limitations of using APIs. We also learnt a lot about just how much work it takes to create a fully built web application.</p>\n<h2>What's next for beatbud</h2>\n<p>We would like to extend our media sourcing options so that we can allow users to submit music/songs from more sources. Soundcloud, Vimeo and file uploading are all media sources we want to incorporate in the future. Additionally, we want to implement more user permissions into each room by allowing room creators to assign room moderators, ban disrespectful users and change voting/nominating privileges. Perhaps in the future we might also be able to stream exclusive content much like Hulu, Netflix or Amazon Video. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ec2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/youtube\">youtube</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/13curtisw/beatbud\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/13curtisw/beatbud\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.beatbud.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.beatbud.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.beatbud.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Team leader.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Sometimes posting a picture in Instagram or Facebook can be more than a hassle when you need to come up with an inspiring, cool, relatable quote. So we decided that we'll help those who are having this exact problem by giving them quote recommendations based on their images.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Given a link to an image or a local image that's uploaded, the web app will give up to 10 quotes that are related to the image.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The user can choose to either submit a link to an image or upload his/her own image. We used the Clarifai Image recognition API to obtain the tags of the image. Using these tags, we search through our database of collected quotes, which we did so by crawling websites containing quotes using a simple python script. We search and return the top 10 quotes with the most relatable/ or closest tags from the image. We used Firebase as our backend, handling storage, hosting, and database, which give us a fast development time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges we ran into was setting up the APIs. It was challenging because we decided that we will use JavaScript for all of our backend. Another notable challenge was figuring out how we can find the most relatable quote from the image. We decided that the web app should prioritize the tags with the highest probability. Given this constraint, it became easier for us to show the quotes.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were proud that our project was a success. Not only did the web app functions just like we planned, we were surprised to find that most of the quotes we show for a given image have relatable meanings. Although, there are some cases where the tags was mistaken as a verb instead of a noun, and the other way around, making some quotes dissociate from the image, we are quite satisfied that our project was successful.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Besides learning about how to use the Clarifai APIs and Firebase, we learned how to structure our project plan and allocate our time well. We also learned how important communication is and most importantly, enthusiasm in creating a collaborative project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for #Quotologist</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to increase the accuracy of our recommended quotes.</li>\n<li>Integrate 'emotions', 'weather', etc. as other factors besides image tags to recommend the quotes.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://voldemort-a50cc.firebaseapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://voldemort-a50cc.firebaseapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>voldemort-a50cc.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["OutfitIt!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OutfitIt! \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/770/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OutfitIt! \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/769/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>User dashboard</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Dubhacks16</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://outfitit.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">outfitit.me</a> is a web-based application that curates a trendy outfit according to the current weather.

As long as a file with the vocab word, a subtitle, and definition are provided, Votab can display it!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What is Votab?</h2>\n<p>Votab is a Chrome extension that overrides your \"New Tab\". Votab chooses random vocabulary from built-in wordlists. This word is then displayed in your new tab in a super stylish \"New Tab\" design. The word is shown for a certain number of times before being swapped out for a new word. So instead of having that useless default \"New Tab\" when you open a new tab, you see a new vocab word with every tab you open!</p>\n<p>Even though you may not spend too much time on a New Tab, those 2-5 seconds that it takes to type a URL and wait for the page to load are enough for your brain to register the word on the page. Once you've processed the same vocab 10 or 20 times, it becomes pretty well engrained (disclaimer: I am not a researcher so this is only my personal observation lol).</p>\n<p>The power of Votab lies in customization. If seeing a word 10 or 20 times isn't enough, then just make that number higher in the settings! If you want, you could even make it so that you see the same vocabulary 100 times before moving on - hopefully you'll have learned it by then! And if you want it to be more consistent, you could change to \"Time Mode\" instead of \"View Mode\", where words will change out on a set timer. For example, you can set it so that you get a new word every 6 hours.</p>\n<p>Votab also provides a very useful feature for learning - being able to skip a word. Pressing the fast-forward button will choose and display a new word so that you don't have to spend time \"learning\" a word you already know.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I super love learning languages (I speak English, Chinese, French, and Japanese with varying degrees of fluency, and recently started learning Korean). One of the hardest parts of learning a language is remembering vocabulary. There's only so much weird grammar a language can throw at you, but there's an almost endless amount of vocabulary to learn. And there's nothing more boring than sitting down and flipping through flashcards to learn words.</p>\n<p>Votab was inspired by a two extensions for learning Japanese vocabulary that I used in the past that also changed the new tab. I eventually stopped using them because they were executed ratherly poorly and weren't all that useful, but I always thought the idea behind them was great.</p>\n<p>One extension had big pictures of each vocab word, which looks cool but isn't very effective for actually learning because the vocabulary itself is not the main focus of the page. Also, it changed to a new word on every new tab, which meant that there was no repetition to help with memorization.</p>\n<p>The other extension was better designed with focus on the vocabulary, but had a tiny wordlist of about 100 words and also forced the user to wait 24 hours between new words. When you get an easy word like \u79c1 (lit. \"I\") it doesn't take 24 hours of seeing the same word on every tab to learn it if you didn't already know it...</p>\n<p>So I set out to make something that took the best features of these extensions with several new ideas of my own for an extension that looks sleek and is helpful for learning languages!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Votab was made with Javascript, HTML, and CSS and the Chrome extension API.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Votab</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>More word lists. Currently only various levels of Japanese are supported, but as you can see in the image gallery Votab's design makes it super easy to add new words and new languages!</p></li>\n<li><p>Word history.

We personally experienced these unexpected horrible delays due to local events. We wanted this problem so that others can prepare their travel in advance.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SwiftTrip is an iPhone app that allows users to look up a list of local events and plan transportation rides accordingly. They can choose different forms of transportation and routes. It even encourages commuting! The Map and List view make it easier for the user to see to analyze in a way that they prefer, from tables to maps.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Originally, we wanted to incorporate Google's API within our app, but after many attempts we decided to create the application using only Xcode. We first started by creating a list table view of all the events as well as an add event page. We then focused on the map view of our application. We utilized the iOS language Swift within the Xcode platform. We discussed how to produce great data visualizations for our users through User Interface Design. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge that we ran into was asynchronous and synchronous data within our application in the Map View. Although we received the support from numerous mentor, we still were unable to fully understand a concept called completion handler block. We then decided that even though we didn't have the resources or experience to accomplish one part of our project, we still thought we could provide a prototype of how the app would work in the future. Another problem we faced was adding radius circles around pins in our Map View. We looked at a plethora of resources in order to incorporate this feature in our project. We believe that we were unable to accomplish this feature because they limited amount of time offered in this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to saw that one major part of our app is fully functionally. Moreover, this project was written in a language that was not familiar to the majority of team members. We were able to communicate easily within our group. Everybody had a positive attitude during the whole experience.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the complexitiy of Google Maps and different types of programming.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SwiftTrip</h2>\n<p>We would love to incorporate a working Map View if we were to release this in the future. Also we would like to incorporate more APIs into our project</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["large space", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted a proceduraly generated space for creatures to walk around in</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We couldn't get openGL to display terrain, but we did get a few cool triangles</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>It was supposed to be C++ and openGL, running on a rasberry pi</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>openGL is too low level for a hackathon</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting anything to display at all through the pi\nGetting SimplexNoise to create a cool terrain map even though we couldn't use it\nHaving fun with friends</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>One of us learned C++\nWe all learned to not use low level stuff at hackathons </p>\n<h2>What's next for large space</h2>\n<p>Better luck next year I guess</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opengl\">opengl</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/lenta/dubhacks-f16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/lenta/dubhacks-f16\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gitlab.cs.washington.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Receipt Itemizer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Receipt Itemizer \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/577/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Receipt</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Managing finances and spending can be a messy problem when you have hundreds of receipts from purchases throughout the year.

This would let the users be sure that they were getting a reliable image. Once the user tapped the screen, a photo would be taken that would be uploaded to The OCR component of Microsoft's Computer Vision API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was the first time programming in Android for every member of our group, so almost everything was new to us. We had a few hangups with the permission settings for taking a photo with the app and then saving it. The mentors were a great help in getting around these problems.

This is when the complaining began.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We noticed that the source of this soreness was likely due to our posture, and how we were all slouching and had necks sticking out. Our computer application uses Microsoft's Emotion Recognition API to detect how close the face is to the webcam. If the user's face starts coming closer to their screen, the app gives a notification telling them to fix their posture.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Microsoft's Emotion Recognition tells gives us the approximate height and width of a person's face in pixels. We had to implement Webcam API to take pictures of the user and analyze how close their face was to the screen. If the face gets bigger than a certain amount when compared to the calibrated distance, the app would warn them. We also implemented emotion sensor to see if the user was sad or angry. In the event that the app recognized this emotion to a significant degree, we would display a joke for them to cheer them up.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team had some trouble at the beginning with coming up with ideas.

Bikes are a great way to get around while minimizing our carbon footprint. However, we also need racks to park our bikes when we reach our destination. A common problem, similar to finding parking for cars, is that we arrive at our destination only to find that all the bike racks have completely filled up.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Enter Bike Bud. This application crowd sources bike rack availability from the public. Find open bike racks near you!</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Find nearby Bike Racks</li>\n<li>Find your location</li>\n<li>Determine the availability of a bike rack</li>\n<li>Determine the time since last update</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://spot-2780a.firebaseapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://spot-2780a.firebaseapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>spot-2780a.firebaseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/huangwaylon/Bike-Bud\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/huangwaylon/Bike-Bud\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Firebase API, Front end, Data import", "Firebase API, Data Processing, Graphics, Design"]], ["SortAI", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SortAI \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/469/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>splash screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SortAI \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/682/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>compost pop-up</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SortAI \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/668/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>recyclable containers pop-up</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SortAI \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/468/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>recyclable paper pop-up</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SortAI \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/670/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>garbage pop-up</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SortAI \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/428/669/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>error pop-up</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>SortAI</h1>\n<p>An app for sorting garbage!
