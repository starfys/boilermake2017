People and businesses are extremely busy due to being constantly connected, but the one thing that seems to keep people on track is their calendar. Additionally, machines aren't yet fully aware of how they should run to optimize power usage from the grid. Nest and other utilities have made an attempt at this, but we wanted to provide an app that would provide power schedules for machines too.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It reads in live power data from a resource, such as a solar grid, and then evaluates any IIoT connected assets that are producing power consumption figures. At planned intervals (15 mins right now) a real time analytic runs on the streaming data to determine a projected operation schedule(s) for the connected devices. Users can evaluate the schedule and determine whether the operational schedule fits their needs or is unreasonable. Multiple schedules and user feedback is taken into account and then retrains the analytic to become smarter.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built on GE Predix and used some of our favorite coding tools such as ReactJS and NodeJS. It's a simple two tiered design. The assets and real time time series data are stored in the predix-asset and predix-timeseries services respectively. We then created a front end in ReactJS that uses a reverse proxy to access the REST apis of the aforementioned services. Our real time analytic is currently run in the front end as the volume of data is small, however; we found that we could easily port the algorithm that we wrote to the Analytics Catalog.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had several CORS issues when dealing with the predix services. Figuring out how to make React talk to the backend REST services proved very time consuming and set us back coding. We also found that there was a lack of real time pricing data for the electrical industry and thus we had to work with batch data sets from utilities.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We feel very accomplished on a number of things but we would like to highlight a few. First, we believe the overall concept of a real time power scheduler that uses real time analytics and streaming data on predix is incredibly valuable and could be used and scaled for multiple residential and business assets. Additionally, our scheduling algorithm was a unique merge of algorithms from the \"Quarter, Nickle, Dime - problem\" and active matrix correlation. Finally, we're proud of the icon, vision statement, and theme we developed for the product.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about the predix eco system and the services that it offers. Additionally, we felt that we really came together as team Arundo and we found that we were able to accomplish a lot despite several ambiguities and adversities in coding.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Power Scheduler</h2>\n<p>We're hoping to fine tune the algorithm a bit more and add an additional features for users to add their own assets in real time. We then plan on pushing to the GE App Store.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://geh16.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://geh16.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>geh16.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was working on the dashboard, including the layout, adding gadget and displaying the chart properly with input data.

Each static asset has a location field inside the Predix Asset model. Our dynamic assets are roaming service teams. These service teams locations are constantly updating inside the Dynamic Mapping service as the teams are moving through the field.</p>\n<p>When a sensor on one of our static assets crosses a threshold (say, the temperature exceeds a certain amount), it automatically looks up the nearest service team (based on latitude and longitude) to the asset, and dispatches the team to the asset location. Upon arrival, the team is able to scan the asset via barcode and place the asset into service mode, which is reflected on the asset dashboard in real-time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the forward-facing app using Node, Express, and JavaScript.

Mobilization will be especially meaningful for those audiences on the floor.</p>\n<p>By providing the integration into the GE store, this application can utilize historical trending and analysis to predict more accurate financial outcomes as a result of our growing product catalog. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/polymer\">polymer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/predix\">predix</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/helizabethwhite/mmhack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.github.com/helizabethwhite/mmhack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["ECOFIT", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ECOFIT \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/446/504/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>ECOFIT</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Our view of an Intelligent Environment</p>\n<p>DESIRED OUTCOMES (for citizens):\nHealthier lifestyle\nReduced healthcare costs\nEnergy consciousness\nLower energy bills\nLower carbon footprint</p>\n<p>DESIRED OUTCOMES (for governments):\nLower healthcare cost burden\nEnergy efficient cities\nHealthy citizens</p>\n<p>Gamification is powerful in motivating behavior change \u2013 to save energy &amp; live healthy.

We saw this as a great opportunity to make the Solano CI platform build and test Predix applications, then use AWS to test them in the cloud and deploy the apps to CloudFoundry.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We built two reference applications in the \"Digital Twin\" space and tested them with Solano CI.\n\u2022\u00a0The first application is based on the RMD reference application, and uses various services including time series, UAA/ACS for access control, and assets; and automatically generates random data consistent with both the reference application compressor and the digital twin data provided for the hackathon.\n\u2022\u00a0The second application uses time-series, UAA, and assets for the engine data provided.</p>\n<p>Moreover,\u00a0Solano CI runs all the Predix unit tests. If they pass, it deploys the app to a staging environment on CloudFoundry and runs the integration tests. If those all pass, then it deploys the app to production. It can run many of the tests in parallel to save time, and displays the JUnit outcomes and Selenium browser sessions in a nice UI.</p>\n<h2>What to try</h2>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Fork the Node.js starter at <a href=\"https://github.com/solanolabs/predix-nodejs-starter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/solanolabs/predix-nodejs-starter</a>\n\u2022\u00a0Follow the instructions on <a href=\"http://docs.solanolabs.com/Setup/predix/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.solanolabs.com/Setup/predix/</a> and other docs to install Solano CI\n\u2022\u00a0Run the tests in Solano\n\u2022\u00a0Also take a look at the full Predix reference app at <a href=\"https://github.com/semipermeable/predix-rmd-ref-app\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/semipermeable/predix-rmd-ref-app</a> , including public sessions showing how the Solano CI automatically tests and deploys the application.

Then we made sure to thread all the Predix/CF authorization tokens throughout the application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0Getting all of the authorization tokens correct was challenging\n\u2022\u00a0Limitations in CF made it hard to deploy more than 10 services at a time\n\u2022\u00a0Some of the Predix reference apps changed over the course of the past few days</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0We have a complete devops pipeline with GitHub, Solano CI, Predix and CloudFoundry.\n\u2022\u00a0We have Selenium browser testing working on the reference app, to ensure that UI/UX works\n\u2022\u00a0We can automatically detect regression errors in the applications before they get deployed</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>\u2022\u00a0We learned a TON about Predix and CloudFoundry\n\u2022\u00a0We learned how to manage authorization</p>\n<h2>What's next for Predix + Solano Continuous

This plant has recently installed RFID tags on all of their carts with scanners at each station in order to track the carts as they flow through. With this new stream of data, the plant urgently needs the capability to intelligently assess their process so they can remove these bottlenecks and drive plant efficiency.  </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Dynamic Mapping, \nUAA, \nTime Series, \nPredix Machine, \nIntel Edison Board, \nPostGres, Cascade, and \nPredix-UI-Seed</p>\n<h2>Our Solution</h2>\n<p>Our application, FLO (Flow Logistics Optimization) leverages the RFID live data stream of timestamp-ed cart locations along with Predix's dynamic mapping service in order to visualize carts on the map as they move through the plant. This enables plant workers and management to see where carts and kits are along the manufacturing process at any given time. \nAlong with this, we've built a set of analytics, which leverage this RFID data to do cycle analysis, empowering management to identify and address performance challenges around kits, stations and employees. \nLastly, we've configured an Intel\u00ae Edison Board with built-in simulation sensors to be applied at the Assembly Stations in Fort Worth, in order to identify potential performance issues early on by visualizing data from sensors on the machines at these work stations.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Dynamic Mapping - \nEdison Board: \n    Initial configuration provided many challenges for us. Ran into issues with known bugs around Windows 7.\nData: \n     We had major challenges with the cleanliness of the data. Currently there are a many repeating records, where the same cart is read multiple times as it passes by an scanner. As well, many airwave frequencies interfere with the RFID system which has caused misreads to be recorded. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Surviving the cold in the tent booth on Tuesday night.</li>\n<li>Surviving the heat and blinding sunshine in the tent booth on Wednesday morning.</li>\n<li>Got our url live and functioning.</li>\n<li>Working Intel Edison Board with incoming data. </li>\n<li>Executing on a real business problem from GE Transportation, and providing immediate business value for that team. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Live data feed correlating to Dynamic Mapping.</li>\n<li>Features on Dynamic Mapping.</li>\n<li>(hashtag) Mannequin Challenge</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for FLO (Flow Logistics Optimization)</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Live implementation of the Edison Board at the assembly station for testing, and further implementation at all stations as relevant. </li>\n<li>Cleansing and process improvement around the RFID data collection.
