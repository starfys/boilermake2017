Imagine six individuals living in a house, with only one shower. Who wants to wake up early, with the intention of showering, only to find out that the shower is already occupied? Time is limited in the morning, and there is nothing more annoying than cramming in a short shower before running to class, or even worse, missing the shower completely. </p>\n<p>We created SmartShower to make scheduling hassle-free and mornings a little more enjoyable. In doing so, we can ensure people are mindful of the length of their showers and apply an internet-of-things solution to an everyday problem.</p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>SmartShower generates an optimal shower schedule based on the Google Calendars of people who live together. Users access the web application to\u2026</p>\n<ul>\n<li>authorize SmartShower to access their Google Calendar (via Google Calendar API)</li>\n<li>configure preferences such as preferred shower time and length</li>\n<li>set a desired shower start time prior to the first event of the day</li>\n<li>view a shared calendar for all users</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using a raspberry pi microcontroller, we made SmartShower not just a web application but also and an internet-of-things device. With the SmartShower device users are\u2026</p>\n<ul>\n<li>informed about current shower status</li>\n<li>given warning indicators regarding amount of time remaining in the shower (LED lights, buzzer sounds)</li>\n<li>charged money for every minute past the scheduled shower end time </li>\n</ul>\n<p>LED flashes and buzzer sounds serve as warning indicators for when a user has only one minute remaining. This use of behavioral cues encourages more efficient water usage. The Capital One Nessie API allows us to integrate monetary incentives into the project. Pressuring users to finish their showers within their scheduled time is a valuable feature, proven to be especially useful in water scarce areas.</p>\n<h2>How it was Built</h2>\n<p>The backend web application is written using a MySQL database. The website is run with flask framework and various python scripts. The scheduling algorithm is a greedy algorithm that handles collisions by equally reducing times of preferred shower times. The algorithm is able to handle multiple collisions during one time period and can calculate an optimal solution every time.</p>\n<p>The raspberry-pi microcontroller runs on a Linux framework. The SmartShower IoT device leverages a python application, which interfaces with multiple LEDs and a sound buzzer. The raspberry-pi encompasses the Capital One Nessie API data, sources a timeline from the shared Google Calendar, and efficiently informs the user about real-time schedules.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>We were able to create SmartShower as a solution to organizing an efficient shower schedule for college students. Our original expectations for SmartShower have been surpassed by utilizing an loT device, monetary incentives, and efficient calendar generation \u2013 allowing SmartShower to truly be effective when used for different purposes as well (ie. to conserve water).</p>\n<h2>Learning Experiences</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>using a Flash framework to build a website from scratch</li>\n<li>working with the Google Calendar API</li>\n<li>implementing the Capital One Nessie API</li>\n<li>working with the MySQL database</li>\n<li>programming raspberry-pi to serve as an loT device</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://smartshower.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://smartshower.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>smartshower.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on hardware with a RasPi, taking the majority of the first night to get it connected to the internet (two bad wifi dongles didn't help).

While children play simple, interactive educational games, the hack detects the user\u2019s risk for developing autism. Moreover, it records a child improvement and recognizes data trends in concentration and brain development over time so parents do not need to regularly visit the clinics.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a range of neurological development disorders including Asperger\u2019s Syndrome and autism that affect approximately 1 in 50 American children. Although the onset of these disorders typically occurs before children are three years old, current methods to diagnose ASD at very early ages are often ineffective, depending on the observation of certain distinctive mannerisms (such as inability to make eye contact) that may not be detected or associated with ASD. Recent research studies, however, have indicated that EEGs can offer a better, more scientific diagnosis of ASD. When children are faced with the task of integrating several different visual and audial stimuli, autistic children experience significantly reduced brain activity because of their inability to quickly process these stimuli. </p>\n<p>We were inspired by the massive potential of this new technology to make the cheapest possible EEG-based ASD-detection hack. Our goal was to create a multi-sensory game integrating many different types of stimuli, such as color, shape, and sound, to determine children\u2019s chances of developing ASD.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our hack, AutiBot, is a simple, accessible game that tests the response of young children to several different visual and auditory stimuli at once by asking them to tap certain dots on the screen. While teaching children about color, shape, number, and more, it also records the time taken by the user to respond to the stimuli and values for the EEG brain activity of the user using the Muse headband technology. Then, by running an Anomaly Prediction machine learning model based on pre-existing datasets of non-autistic , the app calculates the probability of the user developing a mental disease like Autism. The app also has features to store and display the user\u2019s results over time in the form of graphs and recommend actions to the child\u2019s family, like contacting a local doctor, based on the results of the autism-prediction machine learning model.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built the game in iOS using Swift. We used Microsoft Azure to create the predictive machine learning model which analyzes the cumulative data (EEG and reaction times, stored in a Parse backend) from each user and predicts the probability of developing ASD. For reading data on brain activity, we used the Muse headband technology and the LibMuse SDK. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the Muse headband to work was the biggest challenge we ran into. The LibMuse SDK had no support for Swift, so we had to create bridging headers to integrate our Objective-C Muse code with the rest of the app, written in Swift, which ended up being far more difficult than we initially thought. Moreover, pairing the Muse headband to our laptops through Bluetooth was extremely challenging, which also negatively affected our ability to obtain the datasets for the Azure machine learning model.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Actually finishing the hack despite the hurdles with Muse. Also, we were very happy with the UI design and the overall concept/social application of the hack.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how machine learning can be utilized to detect anomalies in data sets. Moreover, two of the members were attending a hackathon for the first time, so the whole experience from product design to product deployment was very exciting and educational for them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/arunrawlani/brainTrain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/arunrawlani/brainTrain\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the Microsoft Azure machine learning model and some UI, including the graphs for EEG and response time data", "Configured and retrieved data from Muse headband.

Anyone with an antenna can pick up on those singles. With LaserComm however, a direct line of sight with the laser must be established to intercept signals. If an intruder intercepts the line of communication, it can be detected immediately and the system can respond accordingly. Second, people wishing to intercept data must be synced perfectly with our transmitter, otherwise they would read in bits out of order and information read would be virtually useless. If one were to encrypt their data before sending it over LaserComm, any information sent over it would be extremely hard to break.  </p>\n<p>2) LaserComm offers a very cheap form of communication. Sometimes laying down fiber optic cables is prohibitively expensive and in some cases it may even be impossible to lay down such wires in remote and poorer regions of the world. Sometimes natural disasters may wipe out a regions infrastructure and communication network. LaserComm would make restoration of critical communication very cheap and very easy. Furthermore, LaserComm is cheaper to repair and maintain than fiber optic cables because it does not require the digging up of such cables. </p>\n<p>3) LaserComm offers very fast data transfer. The speed of data transmission for LaserComm is limited by the clock rate of the hardware it is run on and not the frequency of waves that limits wave based data transmission. Research done by NASA has claimed that speeds of 20x faster than any previous speed record were reached using free-space optical communication and Facebook has put out claims that free-space optical communication would allow for data transmission speeds measured in gigabytes per second. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>LaserComm was built using two arduinos. One for broadcasting and one for receiving information. Text is read into the broadcasting arduino where each char is converted into its 8-bit binary representation. The laser then modulates this information to the receiving photo-resistor. A 0 bit is represented by the laser being turned off while a 1 bit is represented by the laser being turned on. The receiving arduino then reads in the string of 1s and 0s and then converts the information back into a string.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for LaserComm</h2>\n<p>While at this hackathon we only transmitted text files, in the future we can grow the project to encode, transmit, and decode audio, image, and video files. LaserComm can also be optimized with more lasers and photo-resistors to allow for multiple streams of data being transmitted. This would allow for a file to be transferred even faster. LaserComm would also need to be upgraded for use in harsher environments. From a software perspective, LaserComm would be upgraded to include more opp-codes and to handle lost bits to allow for more versatile use. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JeffHe17/Arduino\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JeffHe17/Arduino\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on hardware assembly and idea iteration.

So, I wrote mine in Python. I've always built webapps and I just finished an ML class so I wanted to try it out. Plus, now we can see if art can be scientifically generated?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sonata in Python reads in a series of MIDI files, mostly piano sonatas by Mozart or Beethoven. This acts as the training set for the neural network. The input nodes for the network take the duration and frequency of the preceding 5 notes as well as the current note, the preceding 3 chord progressions, and the corresponding note on the other clef. The output nodes produce the duration and frequency of the next note in the sequence, which is fed back as an input for the subsequent note.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>There is one neural network for the treble clef (right hand) and one for the bass clef (left hand). This is because the higher right hand notes often play a unique melody, while the lower left hand notes are often repeated, slower chords. I wanted to make sure these two very separate styles of music didn't confuse the neural network. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge is that feeding outputs back into the neural network will cause the network to converge. In the beginning, my compositions often converged to a single, repeating note. This produced extremely boring music. I fixed this by introducing mutations to the network. First I tried to sample a Gaussian distribution based on the mean and standard deviation of the error vectors. Then, I switched to a small percentage of changing the note by a perfect fifth or a perfect octave, both of which do not affect the flow of the music much. \nFurthermore, both the treble and bass clefs converged to the same note. I fixed this problem by splitting the the network in two, as mentioned earlier. \nFinally, neural networks do not give very exact predictions. Unfortunately, in music, even the slightest deviation will cause the music to sound out of tune. I often had quarter tones and random durations of notes. I fixed this by rounding the pitch and duration, which significantly increased the quality of the music.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of having done this project alone. I've been to a lot of hackathons in past years, but always under the tutelage of upperclassmen. Now that they've graduated, I'm sort of wondering on my own. I'm glad I was able to accomplish this project without others directing me. \nI'm also proud of how far I came with this project. I compared my first generated sonata to my most recent one and I was really impressed with how good the latter one sounded. Perhaps not yet at the level of Mozart, but it's certainly come a long way. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Music is hard! 36 hours is not enough to create an algorithm that can generate music that has been endeared for centuries. I have a much greater appreciation (but also greater frustration...).\nPython is incredible. Technically, I already knew this, but to be able to produce this quality of a music generating, machine learning algorithm in under 250 lines is incredible. Yes, I only wrote 250 [very well thought out and tested via trial and error!] lines. Python is life.\nI was also introduced to pybrain and music21, Python libraries used for neural networks and analyzing music, respectively. Both of these are very well made and I hope I have an opportunity to explore more of their features in future projects.\nAlso, I had to learn a lot of stat. It was pretty uncomfortable, and I'm not a fan...</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sonata in Python</h2>\n<p>Obviously, more fine tuning of parameters in order to produce even more beautiful music. While I did consider chords in the neural network, harmony is probably the most important missing feature. Harmony analysis is a 36 hour project on its own, and would greatly improve the project. In addition, I'm hoping to expand to concertos and contemporary music. Sonatas are fairly easier because they are generally piano only, with only a left and right hand. Opening to more types of music would be very fun.</p>\n<p>PS. Unfortunately, I have no pictures! There's not much to show about a neural network... However, 10 MIDI files of varying quality can be found on the Github.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pybrain</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">music21</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/phrayezzen/SonataInPython/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/phrayezzen/SonataInPython/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked alone on this project, so I did everything, from MIDI parsing to network training. back to MIDI output."]], ["Digital Pantry", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Digital Pantry \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/167/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Digital Pantry \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/168/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Digital Pantry \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/169/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Digital Pantry \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/170/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Digital Pantry \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/171/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Digital Pantry \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/172/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Digital Pantry \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/173/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It is oftentimes quite hard to determine what things need to be gotten from the store, and especially in the case of things like milk, it is good to have some preemptive warning before things expire. Digital Pantry is designed to automatically notify you about things like expiration dates, and it will even create a shopping list of items to get from the store that are running low.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The application is designed to be a dynamic inventory and grocery list generator for home use.  Users can choose to scan in items with a smartphone/tablet and manually enter information such as quantity or expiration date.  The application will then generate a grocery list, use the Walmart API to find the prices of items on the list to anticipate the shopping list cost, and notify the user when an item has been used up or is expired.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Online Storage of Pantry Items:</strong> Keep track of everything that comes in and out of your pantry, all at the click of a button!  Can\u2019t remember how many eggs are left?  Not sure if you have powdered sugar for the new recipe you want to try?  This will ensure that you always know what you have on hand, whether you are at home or on the go.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Barcode Scanner:</strong> Rather than typing out all the tedious information about every product you bring into the house, just quickly scan the barcode and let us do the work for you!  If you are like us and have a spare barcode scanner lying around, you can use that, or the app can use the camera on your phone to do your barcode scanning.  Digital Pantry interfaces with the Walmart Product API to gather data on product name, size, price, and images to save you time and effort.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shopping List Generator:</strong> One of the most dreaded tasks of grocery shopping is making the grocery list, with every family member liking different things and never knowing whether there is a secret stash of flour hidden in the basement.  Say goodbye to that nudging feeling that you are always forgetting something with the Digital Pantry!  It will automatically generate a shopping list for you that will update as items are added/removed from your inventory, so you will know to get more milk as soon as it is gone.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Shopping Budget:</strong> You can quickly find out exactly how much your shopping trip will cost before you even leave your house.  The Digital Pantry will gather the latest data on item prices and calculate the cost of your shopping list.  This way you will know how much money to bring, what to expect at the checkout line, and whether you have enough to buy a chocolate bar to reward you for your efforts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Expiration Notifications:</strong> Never drink sour milk again!   Digital Pantry will alert you the day before your items expire so that you will know to get a replacement.  It will even automatically add the item to your shopping list after the expiration date.   Adding expiration dates to your items in your digital pantry is completely optional, so feel free to skip this step if you don\u2019t mind sour milk.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Digital Pantry using a mixture of the Corona Framworks for mobile applications and using PHP, HTML, and MySQL. The Corona Framework is a good platform for prototyping mobile application ideas, and as a result was a good platform to build upon for the mobile application. The server and web interface was built using PHP, HTML, and CSS. This ensured that the application could be migrated to nearly any server and still be able to function as expected.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges was simply getting products to scan properly. The hardware barcode scanner we were using took some time to figure out how to set up to start entering the UPC codes. Furthermore, the mobile application gave us quite a bit of trouble for scanning the UPC codes, too.</p>\n<h2>Future Updates</h2>\n<p>In the future, we will be updating Digital Pantry to include features such:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The best time to shop based on coupons or price drops</li>\n<li>A better, more intuitive user interface</li>\n<li>A user login service so that multiple people can have shopping lists on one server</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/corona\">corona</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend of the server and the frontend of the web interface.", "I created the mobile app in Corona SDK to allow for mobile barcode scanning and to interface with the database as well as Walmart's API.

No more having to worry about how many capitalized vs. numbers vs. special characters she had in a specific password.</p>\n<p><strong>Use Case Two</strong></p>\n<p>Alice's father, Bob, needs to take care of some bills but can't get to his credit card account as he is currently in a foreign country where many websites are blocked (actually happened to me - Kevin). Alice has the BioAuth extension on her browser and goes to log onto Bob's credit card account to help him pay the bills. She can't log in directly but can send Bob a link which will authenticate Bob through facial and voice recognition. Alice calls Bob and tells him she sent him an authentication link and after Bob is authenticated, she gains access to his account.

This is because writes are 7x-10x faster on WiredTiger <em>and</em> WiredTiger stays small.</li>\n<li>We then utilized the <strong>zlib</strong> block compressing algorithm in order to keep our footprint as small as possible. Zlib can keep 600MB of MMAPv1 data under 150MB with its compresion, thus achieving our goal of keeping the app small.</li>\n<li>We <strong>indexed on collections</strong> that had frequent reads and writes from in order to maximize read/write speeds.</li>\n<li>We utilized a <strong>range-based sharding</strong> approach on our collection for passwords on the central server in order to keep the process as fast as possible and scalable across many users.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img alt=\"Logo\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/yDQ0Usg.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--mtmoRW7l--/http://i.imgur.com/yDQ0Usg.png\"/></p>\n<h2>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS &amp; ELABORATIONS</h2>\n<p>In order to gain a highly-secure platform we followed a couple main rules:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Unencrypted passwords shall never leave local computer.</li>\n<li>All encryption occurs on the client's computer.</li>\n<li>Salted &amp; Hashed </li>\n<li>Multi-factor Authentication!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>TECHNICAL STACK  &amp; TECHNIQUES</h2>\n<p><strong>Chrome Extension</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>WebSockets &amp; Longpolling</li>\n<li>ExpressJS</li>\n<li>NodeJS (Packaged)</li>\n<li>WebGL &amp; THREE.js</li>\n<li>WebRTC</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>SERVER SIDE</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft Azure VM</li>\n<li>Microsoft Azure Blob Storage</li>\n<li>CentOS</li>\n<li>CloudFlare</li>\n<li>Pop.CO</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>APIs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MongoDB for Database</li>\n<li>Microsoft's Project Oxford for Facial Recognition</li>\n<li>VoiceIt for Voice Recognition</li>\n<li>Microsoft Azure - Hosting</li>\n<li>Microsoft Azure Containers &amp; Blobs </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HACKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h2>\n<p>We had to utilize a ton of hacks to make this possible:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Chrome Extensions don't have access to local file system but we have to have a .wav file written in order to process for voice recognition.</li>\n<li>Chrome Extensions cannot utilize a server -- we had to find a workaround that packaged the Node.JS features that we needed into one extension.</li>\n<li>As a team we struggled with different skillsets and varying levels of fluency with Javascript.

It was a stressful time for us and our friends working out what jobs are good to apply to, and which offers are good to accept. It's difficult to know whether a San Fransisco, California job with high pay and very high living expenses is a better opportunity than a Hamilton, Ontario job with lower pay and much lower living costs. This results in students needing to spend many hours with Google and Excel trying to map out if jobs are good fits for them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It does all the hard work of deciding which job is the best! A student merely needs to enter the addresses of the companies they wish to compare, along with an hourly wage for each. </p>\n<p>Our system will fetch all the relevant information (ie rent costs, transportation costs, food costs etc), and will present them to the user, along with additional fields like \"12 Month Income Projection\". All normalized to the local currency.</p>\n<p>From here the user will have an interactive widget to drag sliders for the different variables to filter out which jobs are better. (For example, the user can slide it to show the max they want to pay for rent, and drag a slider to the amount they want to make over the term).</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The website is built using JQuery, Jade and HTML/CSS. The backend is a NodeJS server that uses Import.IO to scrape the web for the information used to compare jobs, and Mongolabs to store data. IBM Watson Analytics is used to provide detailed analysis at the end, and to help the user find a solution.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There weren't many examples of how to use the Watson Tradeoff Analytics tool outside of the official documentation. It took some time figuring out how to incorporate it with our project. Another problem was dealing with asynchronous Javascript issues with the load times to fetch data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to learn multiple technologies we had no experience with (Watson, Jade, web scraping), and we still finished on time with our team of two.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Job Choice</h2>\n<p>We want to add optional additional fields to the initial prompt, like \"City crime rate\", and \"Distance willing to travel to work\". We just focused on financial reasons to go to a location since we had limited time this hackathon, but there are many more aspects that would be great to compare.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongolab\">mongolab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/import-io\">import.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I made the entire backend of the application.

In our fast and increasingly globalized age, family members, colleagues and friends are spread all around the country and the world. Rendezvous with friends or business partners who live far away is a complex logistical problem and a financial burden.\nDue to market forces in airline industry, a flight to one of the person's city of origin often isn't the most affordable way for two people to meet and this effect increases when three, four or hundred people are involved. </p>\n<h2>What we do?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://halfway.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">Halfway</a> gives travellers the opportunity to think about their plans together and save money by finding more affordable fares for them as a group.

But for us, it's somewhat of an annoyance to shift our glance back and forth from our TV to our smartphones or laptops.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TVTalk is a DirecTV app that displays an IRC-esque chat room for the TV channel you're currently watching right on your screen and updates in real time. The app itself takes up a narrow amount of space on the left side of the TV, and its transparent background doesn't block the picture.  Using a web browser on your computer or smartphone, you can instantly join the discussion. Even if you don't want to engage in it, you can still just watch the feed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our app was built with HTML5 and Javascript, using several extensions provided by the DirecTV platform. Node.js served as the back end. All testing was done on the set top box.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The set top box was unresponsive at times,  forcing us to reset it which took up to 5 minutes.  We estimate that we've lost at least 50 minutes of hacking time just by waiting for it to reboot. </p>\n<p>A lot of web development features were disabled on the set top box. It couldn't display certain images and colors, and there was a very small collection of supported fonts; as a result, our app lacks polish, but it allowed us to focus more on functionality. The box also doesn't support https connections, which proved to be problematic when we attempted to deploy our app to Firebase.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to build our own chat system from the ground up as well as understand most of DirecTV's API. We believe that what we've made can become part of the future of television.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about The DirecTV platform and that it has a lot of potential to become something big. The DirecTV team was always willing to help us out with any troubles that we had. They gave great answers to our questions, offered useful advice, and came over to us to check on our progress. We'd like to give a big thanks to them for all their support this weekend.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TVTalk</h2>\n<p>If we were to turn this into a real product, ideally we would want the TV networks to moderate their chat rooms. Not only would they be able to filter out inappropriate content, but they can also produce content unique to the program currently on the channel.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">directtv-developer-platform</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/josephkhawly/TVTalk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/josephkhawly/TVTalk\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["M-Ball", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"M-Ball \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/140/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Control your players using your mobile as joystick and score touchdown.</p>\n<p>I used Unity Game engine and EA API to connect user's mobile to connect to game server. </p>\n<p>Unity Engine Physics was the real challenge along with time constrains</p>\n<p>I finished what I started</p>\n<p>Perseverance.

We used tesseract, an open-source library for OCR, to extract text from pictures. We also use google books API to find book matches and to search within a book.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Making api calls in Swift (and using the JSON it returns) is not exactly the most intuitive task, but thankfully we found a library (SwiftJSON) that helps a lot.\nWe also found that tesseract does not expose each character's enclosing rectangles in easy ways, so the task of searching within the recognized string, and only highlighting the matched characters is still a bit buggy. We are often able to highlight characters close to the match, but a few characters offset. Given more time, (and we will definitely continue developing this), we could probably improve the accuracy of the highlighting.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating and running my first iOS app. Being able to click a button and debug on my own phone was quite exciting.

Right now, the api doesn't expose the actual page numbers where our query matches, so we linked to a UIWebView of the online google book viewer. Not only that, but enabling the google books api section of the app makes it a little unstable, so that is something we still need to work on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-books\">google-books</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iRapha/cmd-f\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/iRapha/cmd-f\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Working for the first time on a mobile app and on a project entirely in Swift, I designed the Logo, coded a number of functions of the app, helped organize an intuitive user interface, and was part of the creative brainstorm that helped come up with the App and its components to begin with.", "", "", ""]], ["GUNPONG", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GUNPONG \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/211/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GUNPONG \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/329/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>GUNPONG is inspired by the classic arcade game Pong, with our own little creative twist and unique implementation that makes it both a great multiplayer game and an innovative use of the real-time Gun database.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>GUNPONG is a simple multiplayer game that can be visited in a web browser and played with the arrow keys. The objective of the game is to keep the ball from escaping a small circle with a paddle that follows a rotary track around the circle. Many players join this game and are able to participate with the real-time syncing made possible with Gun.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Most of us having extensive web development experience, we decided to write the game entirely in JavaScript, a decision that would later make it very difficult for us to implement the physics we required on the game. It is built on top of the Phaser.js 2D game framework using the P2 Physics Engine with a Node backend that serves a Gun database that updates all clients instantaneously with the positions of the new ball. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>JavaScript gaming frameworks being what they are, we struggled to find a framework that allowed us to create a custom collision bounding box on our uniquely circular paddle. As a result, we had to scrap a different implementation of our game that used <a href=\"http://html5quintus.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quintus</a> and learn <a href=\"http://phaser.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phaser</a>, which none of us had prior experience in. Another challenge was the math and physics involved in calculating angular velocities off of the paddle, since in Pong, each hit from the paddle sets the ball in a new direction based on the part of the paddle it hits. In GUNPONG, not only did we need to find the angle that the ball needed to leave the paddle, but we needed to recalculate this for every hit at a <em>different rotation</em>, since the coordinates at any point were not nearly as reliable as a vertical paddle. The only thing that could have made this more difficult would have been to write this in whitespace.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were proud of being able to leverage Gun's unique real-time, decentralized database syncing with our unique use case of pushing position data quickly across all clients. Because Gun is fully peer-to-peer, it met our needs perfectly and was able to dynamically update all of the positions of the paddle between different players without compromising on speed or relying on other connections.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We went from being completely unfamiliar with Phaser.js to using different physics engines and complex sprite sheets and undocumented features. Michael, with the help of Mark from Gun (whom without this project would have been impossible), learned a lot about Gun's backend features and technology, even finding a <a href=\"https://github.com/amark/gun/issues/98\" rel=\"nofollow\">couple of quirks</a> along the way! </p>\n<h2>What's next for GUNPONG</h2>\n<p>GUNPONG could be improved by using more accurate models for the paddle and ball, since what we have right now is a very rough approximation. </p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>\"paddle\": [{\n            \"density\": 2, \"friction\": 0, \"bounce\": 0, \n            \"filter\": { \"categoryBits\": 1, \"maskBits\": 65535 },\n            \"shape\": [   301, 44.5  ,  276, 32.5  ,  259, 4.5  ,  292, 15.5  ,  311.5, 26  ]\n        } ,\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phaser-js\">phaser.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gun</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">p2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/failedxyz/pong\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/failedxyz/pong\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gunpong.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gunpong.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gunpong.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the game mechanics with Michael, first using Quintus, and later Phaser, implementing the physics necessary for the paddle and ball.", "", "", ""]], ["Breeze", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/teLtW2DyTG8?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Breeze \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/531/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Our aim was to bring smarter strategy to home heating and cooling.

It gives you a result telling you if you were more or less \"intense\" with your speech from memory. If you were more intense, that means you spoke faster, or louder. If you were less intense you spoke slower, or softer.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We have a minimalist website to upload the two audio files. In the background we upload the audio files to parse and use the link generated there to send the sample to the Wolfram Butt. In the Wolfram Butt we create a spectogram of both audio files and save them as images. We binarize both images (make them black and white). Every single black \"hump\" on the image is a block of speech. For both images, these will look nearly identical. We compare the percentage of black in the image to the percentage of whitespace. Both of those results are sent back to Parse and the raw data is used by the website. The website compares both values and comes up with a percent difference: if it's greater than 15% then we know you may have been a little nervous or unprepared and tell you some study tips.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were several challenges we ran into. We wanted a way to continuously stream audio data to the platform, but that was harder than it let on, one of the reasons being that Wolfram cannot accept data like that.

We realize this has been done through object recognition and avoidance in the past, so we decided to focus on an specific idea not done before. Our idea was to use the Kinect V2 for object recognition and depth data, but for small objects and tracking. The user would be able to say in an earpiece, for example, \"What is in front of me?\" Then, a voice will be played through the speaker: \"Object A, B, C, and D.\" Now the user is aware of their surroundings. Then the user can say \"Find Object A\" and whether this be a cup, prescribed medicine, or any other item around them, the program will begin navigating the hand towards to object. In order to make this intuitive as possible, we created a vibration sleeve with 8 motors, implemented with a Myo as well. By combining the two, we could create an intuitive way that directs the user through vibration regardless of the arm orientation. Instead of using previous methods such as information through sound, we use vibration so the user is not distracted and can continue his/her conversations as normal.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>For our demo purposes, we decided to use a webcam and object recognition without depth data because we ran into problems with the Kinect V2. We got a prototype working using a 2d camera, however, and can show our functionality for future development. Using the object detection and hand tracking, we can change the vibration in the sleeve to correspond to the direction the hand should go. It is very intuitive to direct the hand where to go.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our team built this used many aspects to accomplish this task. We used the library Voce for speech to text and text to speech. We used to webcam and OpenCV to do filters and object recognition. We also implemented object recognition using HAAR classifiers to train objects to be recognized. After getting recognition of an object of choice and a hand, we compute the distance of the x and y axis. Unfortunately, we do not have the depth data. However, the hardware still accounts for this difference in order to be used in future development. Using serial data transmission and the Myo connected with the computer as well, we are able to pass data to an Arduino which controls the vibration sleeve. We also added many precautions such a Kinect V2 helmet mount to show where future development is going. We also are working on including Firebase.We plan to host a server of .xml image recognition files.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team ran into challenges with configuring the Kinect V2 to work with OpenCV and accessing the depth stream. We also had compatibility issues using OpenNI. We worked through the issues to develop a prototype that still shows our concept without using the kinect or depth data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of thinking of a performing a very intuitive way to help the blind. I like that we are creating something to help the visually impaired perceive the environment around them in a new way. Through this, a user will be able to instantly recognize objects around them and easily maneuver towards them.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Through this project I learned a lot about vision processing and c++ in visual studio. We did a lot of work implementing the software with hardware, and I learned a lot through this. I created the arduino vibration sleeve, and I learned through my teammates a lot with the programming side. Are team also learned the difficulties involved with vision processing and object recognition. I think we all learned valuable skills that we can later use to improve the project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Innovation InSight</h2>\n<p>We plan to improve everything done during Mhacks to continue the help for the visually impaired.

Having never worked with facial or vocal recognition or any type of related software, we knew it would probably take the entire weekend to get a functional product, but figured it would be an excellent learning experience.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The facial recognition software starts by taking 10 pictures of the user in a second. It uses those pictures as a base and generates a variation matrix, composed of 10 vectors of differences of each picture from the average. This data is what can be stored for each customer, amounting to roughly 250KB of floating-point data (but can be increased or reduced depending on requirements). We then take a picture of the user attempting to authenticate. The variation matrix undergoes singular value decomposition to create a \"plane\" of face data, and then the picture from the authenticatee is projected onto the plane with a certain \"success\" ratio defining how well it projects. For high projection ratios, the user is authenticated.</p>\n<p>The vocal software simply takes an input blurb from the authenticatee and uses fast fourier transforms to get a sound spectrum of the various frequencies, as well as generates the decibel power level of the voice. These two values can be used to differentiate the actual account owner from a fraudulent user attempting to gain access.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The code is all written in Python 2.7 with various libraries, primarily OpenCV and Numpy for the facial recognition, and Wave, Numpy, and Pylab. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Originally we wished to upload the matrix data into the cloud and have all SVD computations and comparisons done on Wolfram's cloud computing platform, but the raw amount of data we had was not easily transferred. We also ran into numerous issues getting OpenCV to recognize our faces and ignore face-like objects (it had a strange attachment to my left shoulder as a face...)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even though it's difficult to get clean data from both services, the data yield is incredibly accurate when it does turn out correctly. With better hardware and a better trained facial recognition software, authentication via \"selfie\" could be achieved.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to manipulate graphics on the fly, as well as audio. I learned how to extract data from the two sources, as well as how to process them to accomplish various tasks.</p>\n<h2>What's next for VeriFace</h2>\n<p>I still have much to learn about graphics processing and facial recognition, as well as about the various quirks of OpenCV. Before attempting to further VeriFace, I intend to learn more about the code base behind OpenCV as well as the theory behind image processing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">svd</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NiharS/VeriFace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NiharS/VeriFace\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["StreamPoint", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StreamPoint \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/879/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StreamPoint \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/880/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StreamPoint \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/882/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We, as a society, constantly need to \"rapidly create\" (read: wing) presentations.

At 22 years-old, Hai competed for three short years before deciding to leave all professional gaming behind in what some consider the peak of his career.</p>\n<p>His reason for retiring? An injury to his right arm and wrist developed through repetitive stress and a lack of proper attention or care. Despite attempts to return to League of Legends, Hai's rare form of tendonitis will permanently hinder his ability to compete - it is 100% untreatable, even through surgery, but was 100% preventable through exercise and attention.</p>\n<p>1 in 4 of the programmers competing in MHacks will develop a repetitive stress injury within ten years of graduating, causing drops in office productivity, job loss, and a need for surgery. However, OSHA claims 90% of these injuries (almost 500 students here today) are preventable through proper exercise.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Finger.Yoga helps this high-risk group prevent these injuries by reminding the user to take a break anytime they sit for at least an hour and to use that break for stretching common injury locations. </p>\n<p>By using the Apple Watch, Finger.Yoga is able accurately train and confirm the user's ability to perform over twenty stretch exercises aimed at preventing repetitive stress injuries. Using several complex methods of motion tracking, including a boosted gyroscope sensitivity and scan latency in the heart-rate sensor, the application can even determine what finger a user is touching with their thumb during the Piano exercise.</p>\n<p>Users are rewarded with achievements, points, and the opportunity to compete with friends and their favorite professional gamers for the best Finger Yoga streak.</p>\n<p>Even without owning an Apple Watch, the user is able to participate and track their progress as they learn the many exercises. These exercises were developed in collaboration with a professional reflexologist that has been practicing medicine for over twenty years.</p>\n<h2>How was it built?</h2>\n<p>Finger.Yoga might just be Team Cloudfloss's most ambitious project to-date. With a brand new beta WatchOS 2 SDK to attack and a large marketing push, we knew that laser focus would be necessary- which is why we invented (and then implemented) Hackathon Agile /w standup every hour! Eighteen sprints and a mountain of post-it-notes later, Finger.Yoga is ready!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Finger.Yoga</h2>\n<p>Last night, Finger.Yoga was plugged by a popular Hearthstone streamer in the middle of his Twitch.TV broadcast. We received over 3,000 requests for alpha access codes and chose 700 of those users to test our application based on their ownership of the Apple Watch and willingness to provide feedback. We plan to expand the app's competitiveness and provide companies with private community leaderboards in order to promote healthy programming from within.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">watchos-2.0</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">one-hour-agile</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://finger.yoga\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://finger.yoga\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>finger.yoga</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed and implemented both of our websites.", "Third year CS major ", "", "", ""]], ["toot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"toot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/779/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"toot \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/780/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"toot \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/781/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"toot \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/782/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"toot \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/785/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"toot \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/786/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"toot \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/787/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>In high school, I used to tutor a lot. When I say a lot, I mean 7 to 8 hours a week after school while managing extracurriculars, tennis, and the toils of a magnet high school student. So, when I did work, I wanted to get the most out of my time spent. I knew I was a decent tutor, and I knew that there were kids in my area that needed help, but I found that it was difficult to pair us up. I had to go through major companies that were trusted by parents, but charged $50/hour while I only got paid $12/hour. Obviously, the way out of this would be to ask the parents to just pay me $25 cash, but this was against my contract with the company and could result in a lawsuit. Back to the original problem, why isn't there a way to connect me and the student/parent?</p>\n<p>\"toot\" (name subject to change for obvious reasons) is essentially a social network for parents and tutors. Students like me can get on the website and create a tutoring profile. Here, they can enter all the information parents are looking for: high school, test scores, grades, GPA, etc. The website displays it in an attractive manner using the \"skeleton\" css layout (<a href=\"http://getskeleton.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://getskeleton.com</a>). This was not accomplished during my time at MHacks, but ideally the parent would be able to filter through all tutors on the website by location, and eventually by courses taught.</p>\n<p>I built this using traditional web dev techniques. Javascipt, HTML, and CSS were all utilized during the process. For the back-end, I used FireBase, as that was hugely promoted at the hackathon itself.</p>\n<p>This project posed many, many challenges. I came into this hackathon with practically zero web dev experience (I only knew Java before this). In addition, this was my first hackathon, which was pretty overwhelming. Firebase was not easy to learn, but with the help of a few peers I was able to manage. </p>\n<p>I am actually pretty proud of this project. Considering I knew literally nothing before this, the product currently looks pretty nice. Web development is definitely going to become more present in my future, and backend is not nearly as daunting as I thought it would be. I learned a ridiculous amount, and this really got me excited for future hackathons where I hope to learn just as much. </p>\n<p>I want to develop this into a finished product. I am going to get the website up and running and tell kids at my high school to use it. Hopefully, you'll be able to see this soon!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/imparikh/mhacks2015toot.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/imparikh/mhacks2015toot.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Blaze", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Blaze \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/070/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Blaze \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/290/201/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Blaze \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/290/203/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Blaze \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/290/204/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Blaze \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/290/206/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My close friend, Michael, lost his house due to a blaze accident. By the time the firefighters arrived and found the central point of the blaze, the fire had engulfed all of the house including valuable stuff in his room. This has inspired me to develop blaze, and I thought, if the firefighter were able to find the central point of the blaze ahead of time, the house would have been saved. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Now, and like never before firefighters as well as farmers are able to fulfil their duty optimally using Blaze. Blaze helps firefighters to find central point of the blaze and farmers crops temperature promptly &amp; accurately.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wanted to leverage technology, so we used drone technology to make use of aerial photography advantages as well as thermal imaging technology to get the average temperature for farmers crops and central point of fire blaze wirelessly and accurately.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Science evolved, and proved that the most efficient way to solve a problem is to tackle its roots and based on this scientific approach we have developed one aspect of Blaze, where we find the central point of the blaze.

Additionally, we had were completely unfamiliar with the travel APIs that we were using, as well as how APIs worked in general, and so we had to figure out HTTP querying, the whether GET/POST was more applicable to our needs and how to POST data with a JSON. Eventually, we ran into such a roadblock with this issue that we abandoned APIs that used POST, and have only made queries with GET.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>    At first, we had no idea what to build on top of, until we were made aware of a language called Rails that takes care of much of the server-side code for you. Our Rails environment was written in an online IDE called Nitrous.io that provided as a server, to which we added the Sabre API for flight information.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>    We are very proud of the fact the two of our three team members came into this weekend with no knowledge of Rails and none of us had seen the APIs, yet together, we brainstormed, decided on the functionality we wanted, began and stayed motivated. Our group seeked out help when we needed it, and despite a large number of roadblocks, we were never discouraged, only more motivated to solve the problem. Coming out of this experience, we have a functioning prototype of our idea, and though it isn't as we necessarily imagined it, we are all excited to see how motivation and learning can pay off.\n    Like most hackers, we love to travel. We also believe that finding flights is one of the most annoying things that one has to deal, especially when trying to attend a hackathon. We dream to travel the earth, be alone with nature and bckpck all over the globe. The problem is that not everyone can afford to make these trips with a price that fits there budget, so we wanted to make a software API (now Sabre) that would manage trip planning on a micro-level for individuals.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Together, we all learned management skills for coordinating team efforts, how to query APIs and send HTTP requests in general, strategies for learning new languages, how to build a web server, how empathetic the hacker community, and how product image can make or break the product.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Our software API (Sabre) helps to find users a flight to fit whatever their budget may be. In turn, this saves the consumer money on each flight, and gives every person an opportunity to travel the world one place at a time.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>future plans</h2>\n<p>Bckpckr wants to be the authority on traveling. In the next few months, we will aim to offer several different features:\n    1. Allow for users to randomize their search. Travel anywhere with a curated list of suggested travel areas based on your buying power at that point in time. \n    2. Begin steps to open journaling features for the travels you have taken. Post them onto the site, and allow them to serve as a travel guide for future travelers. (eg sites to see, recommendations on places to stay, etc.)\n    3. Expand services to offer the cheapest hotel and car costs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coffeescript\">coffeescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/less\">less</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bootstra</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ackrumb/bckpckr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ackrumb/bckpckr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked the full stack for this project.

From clicking buttons to touch screen, from touch screen to motion sensor, the functionality of everything requires less and less of the user, making its usage more at ease. Soon this lead to using simply thoughts as a source of control. Our team had the opportunity to take part in MHacks 6 and was given access to Muse, a EEG headset. We decided to take this chance to make an app that would connected to the language of the world: music.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Museic is an application which uses the Muse headset to detect the user's level of excitement, and from that data, will make a personalized music playlist from spotify.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We made use of the Muse Research Tools SDK. We used <code>muse-io</code> to read data from the Muse over Bluetooth, and we used <code>node-osc</code> to connect it to our Node/Electron GUI application. To find the songs, we use the Spotify API, proxying to it using a custom Azure backend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This project put each of the team members into new situations as well as environments. For each of us, challenges appeared at every corner.</p>\n<p>Ningxian Fan: For me, this project was very challenging because I was still relatively new to coding. One of the parts that I had to finish was in the language of javascript to which I had to previous experiences with. This made my biggest challenge which was to learn and do some simple coding in javascript within a short amount of time.</p>\n<p>Anjana Rajagopal: This project was a huge learning experience for me. I had the opportunity to expand my knowledge of Javascript/Node, GitHub, and audio-oriented programming. Although challenging, I learned a lot and got to experience all the different possibilities that could come out of projects like these. My role was mainly front end, working on the audio functionalities, the changes in mood, fades into songs, and getting songs via URL. Nathan taught me so much from this project and I'm coming out of MHacks as a more confident hacker, programmer, and problem-solver.</p>\n<p>Nathan Moos: This was my first time writing an Electron app, so figuring out Electron's interprocess communication (IPC) architecture was the first challenge. I eventually figured out that we could use the IPC module and the webContents module to perform bi-directional asynchronous communication. Additionally, the Muse SDK for Linux did not appear to work, leaving me to primarily build the frontend early on. Additionally, at this hackathon, I held the role of the most experienced frontend developer, and I wished for each of my team members to build significant portions, so I spent most of my time tutoring my teammates. I hope they feel like they did something, because they were awesome!</p>\n<p>Vinay Hiremath: This project was a wonderful experience, though it was not without challenges. During construction of the Node.js backend, which integrates with Spotify to provide curated results based on mood, I delved into some JavaScript constructs such as nested promises which at first resulted in some difficult-to-trace errors that were later resolved after more extensive debugging. In addition, closer to completion we ran into some inconsistencies with the Spotify API likely due to copyright restrictions that necessitated a tricky fix. Overall, I was able to use the Express web framework for the first time to create a simple yet reliable API.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Simply accomplishing this project under the time limit we had was an accomplish that every one of us were very proud of. Throughout the production period, we also had our own individual proud accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Ningxian Fan: When we first started this project, we thought that only using alpha waves data would be a good enough indication of the level of excitement for a person. However, as we started testing out the data we found that there was a correlation but it was not as strong of a correlation as we wanted. I then did some research on Google and found that alpha waves were the dominant waves for when a person is meditating while beta waves are the dominant waves for conscious thinking. I then shared this with the team and tried to record the data of the ratio of beta to alpha waves. We then found that there was a very strong correlation between the ratio and the excitement level of the users.</p>\n<p>Anjana Rajagopal: I am very proud of the learning experience that this project and my peers enriched me in. I'm happy to have gotten the opportunity to work so well in a team and get to know several different languages and programming applications. It showed me a new side to computer science hat I could not have imagined and I had the opportunity to build something big and unique. It really paid off in the end with our combined intelligence, teamwork, determination, and passion, and it leaves me yearning to come back for more of these experiences.</p>\n<p>Nathan Moos: I am very proud of my teammates I tutored -- they managed to pick up JavaScript, Node, and Electron within the first four hours of the hackathon. Many of them only had experience from the Intro to Computing course at the University of Michigan, so they not only learned a new language, but they also learned powerful, valuable techniques for building apps.</p>\n<p>Vinay Hiremath: I was definitely proud of the experience I got working with more complex APIs that in this case required OAuth authentication, which I did not have much experience in. However, by persistent and reading through various pieces of documentation I was able to create a backend API that fulfilled the needs of the project, which was to respond with songs of various mood types that were discovered by searching through playlists with relevant keywords.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Ningxian Fan: For this hack, I learned some basic javascript coding as well as some new interesting facts about brain waves. I always thought that each computer language was completely different from another, but after receiving help with javascript, I found that it was very similar to c++.</p>\n<p>Anjana Rajagopal: I learned so much from this. Not only did I learn Node, Javascript, Electron, and Git, but I also learned about many of the fascinating tools and details of the muse. I learned to work better as a teammate, keep myself motivated throughout the 36 hours, do the best that I could with all that I had, and had a lot of fun during the whole process. I got a lot of help throughout this project, but I got so much out of it.</p>\n<p>Nathan Moos: I learned how to process the massive brain-wave data stream, how to tune a threshold loop when under pressure, how the Electron multi-process architecture works, and how we can make use of programs written in a variety of languages via the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol. Additionally, I learned more about how to teach people languages, runtimes, and systems they are not familiar with.</p>\n<p>Vinay Hiremath: I learned to use the Express web framework as well as better ways of handling OAuth with Node.js, but also a lot more about the intricacies of the brain waves that the Muse device captures. There was a large stream of data that needed to be efficiently processed in real-time, and I learned more about the significance of each.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Museic</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing accuracy for the mood detection feature</li>\n<li>Improving the UI to facilitate generating client OAuth tokens</li>\n<li>A method for users to receive an email with their generated music</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muse-api-javascript-pure-css-node.js-electron-spotify-express.js-azure</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muse-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pure-css</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spotify\">spotify</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I created the backend which connected with the Spotify API to generate relevant song choices (while avoiding repeats from a small sample size).

This gave her the idea of creating an app aimed just for that\u2014 to help anyone handle their negative thoughts to lead happier, more fulfilled lives. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Utilizing mobile app technology, Float helps its user improve their mental health by understanding their emotions and suggesting credible, psychologically proven cures that are fun and interactive to the user, which they can use to immediately improve their current mental well being. The app first encourages a daily input, allowing the user to reflect on the day they've had or are currently having. By allowing the user to reflect on their day, it encourages the user to think about how they are feeling and their psychological health. </p>\n<p>The app focuses on four major issues in mental health that a majority of our society deals with on a daily basis: stress, depression, anxiety, and anger. Whenever the user feels particularly bad, the user can figure out specifically how to cure their psychological troubles. Float is intended for everyday use, to aid the user in improving their mental knowledge of their own psychological needs.</p>\n<p>Float is not a substitute for a qualified medical professional however and if a user is experiencing a psychological breakdown, they should seek help immediately. Float offers an alert feature, whereby the user can press the alert button to send a text to contact their emergency contacts if they are having a panic attack or are having thoughts or contemplating of suicide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our team used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery Mobile to create our front end and Firebase as our database. Our alert function was created with the Twilio API to text emergency contacts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our team experienced the major challenge of choosing functionality vs design. As our first Hackathon, we weren't as experienced with the design of web interfaces or UX/UI, so we decided to use jQuery Mobile as an easy solution. We realized that with jQuery Mobile, the design of our web app was not ideal for our intended audience and wanted to implement a more appealing environment. After many hours trying to make jQuery mobile aesthetically pleasing, with help from a mentor, our mentor recommended that we switched over to HTML and used Bootstrap for our CSS. After realizing that we would not have enough time to implement the changes with Bootstrap because our Firebase was already implemented in jQuery, we opted for the more functional option: jQuery Mobile. Again.</p>\n<p>We also encountered trouble with Firebase because we were not familiar with using it as a database. Even after going through the JavaScript web guide, we were still completely lost and had to ask the Firebase sponsors to teach us how to use it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We Are Proud Of</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even after our challenges, we are proud of our web application and were able to accomplish many goals on our to-do list. We are all very proud of the teamwork and creativity that we were able to bring to this project. In creating this project, we were all able to get out of our comfort zone and explore different aspects of hacking that we weren't able to before. This project may not have not have been the best, but we all put our best sleepy efforts into it and are proud of what we made. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We split our project into three: front end, back end, and research, and we all participated in all three of these aspects and learned a lot by going out of our comfort zone and working on things we normally wouldn't. Firebase was a favorite for one of our members because she had never used Firebase and in this project went from knowing nothing to being able to implement our apps own database. We all explored these aspects of web development and learned a lot abut what not to do. </p>\n<p>As our first Hackathons, we also got to experience Hackathon culture and learned all about different companies and APIs that we could implement into our projects.We crucially realized that prioritization is key in Hackathons and not to take on a load that we cannot handle. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What's Next for Float</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We hope to make Float come to life by fixing out design by redesigning it, strongly paying attention to UX/UI. Our goal is to turn Float into a non-profit, hoping to introduce Float to everyone, and making everyone's own mental health a priority in their lives.To do this, we are going to look for the next step to make this into a reality and search for funding options for our non-profit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ambrosiaandhoney.com/Float/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ambrosiaandhoney.com/Float/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ambrosiaandhoney.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["ChatLoco", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ChatLoco \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/492/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our main inspiration behind the creating this product was to have a faster form of communication in the form of \"channels\" similar to slack but without the set up time it requires. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ChatLoco provides an easy place to create a custom URL chatroom where you can chat with people in your school project group or other groups. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using basic HTML webpages on top of a Firebase database system to manage the messages and chatrooms.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest struggles we had was understanding Firebase for the first time and using it to be able to write our message data.

As a result, we came up with SMSiri -- a tool that enables users without internet plans on their mobile devices to access the valuable data of the web via text message / SMS.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SMSiri utilizes natural language processing to ascertain the intent of a SMS message, and then utilizes one of various APIs to answer the message and compose a reply.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>SMSiri is built on a flask backend, using a myriad of APIs. We used the wolfram|alpha API for general information retrieval, the Bing Maps API for step by step navigation between an origin and destination, the Microsoft Translator API to translate phrases between two languages, the Open Weather Map API to get the present weather at any location in the world, the Twitter Python library to retrieve the latest tweet of a certain user, the Yahoo Finance API to look up the prices of stocks, the Expedia Activities API to discover interesting activities near a location, and lastly the Microsoft Azure Bing News API, which allowed users of SMSiri to view headlines pertaining to any topic or location around the world through text messaging.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>After deploying to heroku, we realized that certain functionalities had been destroyed. As a result, we tested the code on local only to find it unfaulty. After several hours of troubleshooting, we were able to (with the help of a Twilio developer evangelist) ascertain that it was due to heroku's attempting to print out unicode characters.</p>\n<p>Try SMSiri out at (714) 500-7689!

We thought that it would be cool to design a game that is a simple, multiplayer,and, ultimately, easy-to-access. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our game is a battle royale, last-man-standing ball simulator that allows a user to compete against his/her friends. We created the simulator using Unity. A person controls a ball which can be maneuvered using a smartphone device. The direction the phone is tilted, the direction the ball moves. Depending on the angle or how far the phone is tilted, the computer adjusts the momentum and speed of the ball. We also built in a \"boost\" button as a feature that allows a player to jump in the direction it is moving. While in the air, the ball can be re-directed to go a different course.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The game was built from the ground up using C# in Unity.

Another consideration is placing screens in public waiting areas such as traffic lights and bus stops. Instead of sitting at the bus stop and waiting, the time could be spent on interacting with people of all ages. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ea</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vr/game-design</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ColeHud/ballsierLife\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ColeHud/ballsierLife\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the thumbnail using illustrator.

After the survey is completed the user is given links to the video streaming service.</p>\n<p>In the preflight/postflight part of the part, the user is prompted to enter their flight destination, place of departure, time or arrival, and time of departure so that the app can best find the cheapest possible Delta Airlines ticket and in addition help them book the cheapest hotel, car rental, and entertainment packages while at their destination. Making the job of a travel agent, obsolete. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Not having the sufficient skills to build a fully functional app, especially on my own, I utilized the power to fluidUI to demo the look of the app I envisioned. In the app mockup I included the links to the APIs I utilized and survey that I made so that when I can build the app down the road I have all the necessary information and data to include in it.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Not being much of a coder, I ran into the challenges of building an app of the complexity that I wanted to build. I tried multiple routes to produce this app from using python and Django, to using Parse. Not having a partner and being dedicated to this project didn't help me either.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even though I may not have produced an functional app, I'm proud that I was able to continue working and built the framework for an app that at least intrigued the members of Expedia, Qualtrics, and Delta Air. I'm also happy to say that I now know what APIs are and how to better use them, that I got to talk one-on-one with the members of the companies I was building this framework for, that I attended several workshops, and get to try new and innovative technologies.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that although I might not be a decent coder, that there are still ways for me to showcase my ideas. I didn't know of FluidUI before I came here. I also didn't know much about Hackathons, or CTFs, or how many cool and interesting people there are at Hackathons. I'm really happy I came out, but next time I'll brush up on my app build skills beforehand!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Delta Care</h2>\n<p>During the school year, regardless of its commercial adoption, I will learn how to better make apps and continue to build its real functionality on iOS and android.

Rent car in advance.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Board</h2>\n<p>What about integrating web payment for unregistered user who wants to split bill together? What about an Android app?

And he will have no idea who posted the 'roast' and he can only wait and watch while his friends roast him on the hot grill. However, it doesn't end here at all. Even though the original OP (who started it anonymously) is never revealed, you have to have the guts to write a comment in the roast because its done all wide in open. And the person being roasted can see you as well. So, watch out! You can be the next one being on the roast.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Parse for site hosting, back-end and database.

That is 150 new tabs to open and close. Which is at least five minutes of investment. Daily. We wanted to cut that time of investment by 50 percent or more. Saving the pain to open and close tabs again and again, reducing clutter and finishing tasks without much distraction. </p>\n<h2><strong>What it does</strong></h2>\n<p>This is why we created popsicle. A whole new way to save your one second at a time, marginally saving a lot of time throughout the day. Your search engine pops-up right at your selection of any text without leaving the active window.</p>\n<h2><strong>What you can do with it</strong></h2>\n<p>This feature is up for exploration by anyone. It is funny how anything that we enter to the search terms, yields so many unexpected results. I mean, when we selected 'Ten Millions', we were not expecting to know about a famous minor league baseball player, or know about the rock band 'The Used' by just simply selecting the term used randomly. On a much more productive note, there are so many small queries we feed into search every now and then that just require our attention for a small period. For instance, getting a gist about a famous person while reading an article, knowing and comparing prices or getting answers to calculations. </p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges I ran into</strong></h2>\n<p>Most of the websites don't allow you to iframe due to security reasons which led us to duckduckgo's awesome compatibility features. We also wanted to integrate major websites search results right in the pop-up, but since we wanted to respect the framing preferences of the author, we just stuck with quick-access buttons that open that website with the search term in a new tab. Still, saves a second, eh?</p>\n<h2><strong>What's next for Popsicle</strong></h2>\n<p>We understand that no two individuals have a similar type of activity on the internet, and to respect that we will look into creating options for users to select their own quick-access buttons. We will also be looking into using a lot more site-specific API's to summarize the data of popular sites in the iFrame, that don't allow iframing, and then providing an option to open it in another window for a more detailed read. </p>\n<h2><em>Additional features</em></h2>\n<p>We used walmart's api to list out all the available items in store with accordance to the selected text. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/VishalRohra/MHacks-Popsicle\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/VishalRohra/MHacks-Popsicle\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["e-Valuator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"e-Valuator \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/086/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"e-Valuator \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/855/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"e-Valuator \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/191/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I always thought it was cool to be able to evaluate or price everyday objects that you both own or don't, just to know how much you could sell / buy them for. This app is our solution to make this as interactive and easy as possible. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>With augmented reality we can scan objects using image recognition around your room.

We used Unity3D to process capture the image, where it was then exported to our python server. The server acts as router that directs the image to the Cloudsight API, which processes and returns a full phrase associated with the scanned image. Using tailored word processing, the data is then sent through both Walmart's and eBay's API to acquire a retail value and highest bid value of the scanned object. In the background, our images are stored using Parse, and our web server is managed through Microsoft Azure. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>To link the c# Unity3D client with the python server APIs, as well as learning to configure the meta goggles themselves were all challenges in their own right. After hours of scratching our heads, we can happily say we solved almost all of these challenges. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Working together to making something we all were passionate about. Also overcoming the long and hard to find bugs that almost prevented us from finishing this project. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned more about almost every API mentioned earlier. Most were not common to us, however after this hackathon we can see we are one step closer to being able to use some of these APIs to much greater extents.</p>\n<h2>What's next for e-Valuator</h2>\n<p>More platforms, since the REST API is reusable.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">meta-goggles</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cloudsight\">cloudsight</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/walmart-open\">walmart-open</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ebay\">ebay</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-translate\">google-translate</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Market Central", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Market Central \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/107/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Market Central \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/109/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Background</h1>\n<p>If there's one thing college students need less of; it's stress. This is especially true for incoming freshman; although they are not dealing with the stress of taking upper-level courses and struggling to finish their assignments on time (yet), they have the added pressure of moving into their new homes away from home for the next eight to nine months. Non-freshman have an advantage in the sense most of have figured out how to complete a successful move-in process. However, whether it be campus-housing or not, a multitude of problems still arise when students try to find the stuff they need to have a successful academic year. For example, some items are always needed by students in a certain period of time.</p>\n<h1>Our Idea</h1>\n<p>Market Central is an easy-to-use, online web application that allows users to buy and sell items of their choosing quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<h1>How it works</h1>\n<p>Market Central tackles these problems by implementing a unique matching algorithm using Python. This algorithm sets up a matrix where the columns and rows are buyers and sellers respectively. The individual blocks of this matrix are the actual matches. A match constitutes two things: if the buyer and seller have reached a settlement on the price of the item and whether or not the buyer's or seller's time requirement has been met. Meeting two criteria improves the algorithm efficiency and the overall buying and selling process.</p>\n<p>Market Central's backend is set up on the Firebase platform. In addition to having static hosting, all of the user/item data is stored on Firebase's database. This causes users to interact with the most up-to-date information and increases the overall user experience. We also paired Market Central with Facebook login so users don't have to create an additional account when using our website.</p>\n<h1>Future Goals</h1>\n<p>We hope to extend the abilities of our website and implement mobile applications for Android and iOS down the road.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jayanthkoushik/mhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jayanthkoushik/mhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend, focusing on the code for the matching algorithm.

The content we watch is already on the biggest screen in the house in all of its great HD quality. We love watching shows on the television, but we ALL hate searching through all those thousands of channels to find the show we want to watch. Channel surfing feels a lot more like hunting, and I'm looking to provide subscribers with a big frickin spear to catch their show quickly and effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WhatsUpNext is a mobile app that is centered around one button that will change the channel for you. When you sign up, you will designate the shows and channels you love. Then, while you're watching live TV, you can shuffle through all of your favorite content. From the shows saved on your DVR, to your favorite channels, WhatsUpNext will bring you what you really want to see. When the commercials come on, you can turn on \"I'm watching this\" mode. The app will remember which channel you were watching, and turn back to your favorite program when it thinks the show should be back on the air.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Android Studio to build the app's framework, and connect to DirectTv's set-top box with a few simple JavaScript commands.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There is a clear battle between advertisers and subscribers with this app. Coming up with a solution to both parties is a very interesting challenge. If everyone is happy, that makes is a lot more possible for a provider like DirecTv to support an app like this.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm very proud of the effectiveness of such a simple idea. I'm even more proud that I took on a project with a few areas that Im' not at all familiar with, but gave it my all and just figured a bunch of things out. For example, I've never used web languages or done a hardware based hack before. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>You can really do anything with the proper support. And great Ideas can be very simple. It's about weather they solve a problem and could be relevent.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WhatsUpNext</h2>\n<p>Definitely going to finish development, and add several features to put it in the Android store.

Since the color value can tell you how dark or light the pixel is through a number, the program could see basic shapes depending on if the surrounding colors were of similar value. From here I can start to draw lines based on drastic color differences and overall have a very accurate tracking system. I mean really exact. Like better than XBox One Kinect exact (keep in mind the program uses a 10 dollar laptop camera). From here I told the program to track motion and thus allowing it to see my hands. With more time I can use the tracking system to do about anything; get pizza, play music, control a drone, etc.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Often times the plugins didn't work. I literally tried everything to make them work. For example, after spending at least 5 hours on an error I installed an entire Linux distribution on my machine to see if windows was causing the issue. I also had other issues like the camera not being compatible. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I created a tracking system better than Microsoft's in 2-3 days. If that's not crazy I don't know what is.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a crazy amount of how broken open-source projects are.

at your plate of uneven, mostly round pancakes and wondered why they couldn't be a little more spectacular and add a little thrill to your life? \nHave you ever watched a pancake art video only to shake your head in dismay because you lack the artistic skills to reproduce such creativity?</p>\n<p><strong>Fear not, for Printcakes the pancake printer is here!</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Printcakes is a pancake printer that accepts user image inputs via a desktop interface or Android application and then prints a pancake. The two input methods supports 2 shades when printing pancakes.The printer will print the darker colors first, followed by the lighter colours. The application interfaces can be found above in the project image gallery. For those artistically challenged, it may be possible to select pre-programmed pancake designs ensuring fluffy buttermilk pancakes for all.</p>\n<h2>The build</h2>\n<p>Printcakes was inspired into existence prior to the hackathon. Thus, our team had sufficient time to gather the necessary pre-cut materials. Printer rails were salvaged off of old printers and used as the main motor tracks. All materials excluding the electric griddle were recycled materials recovered from old projects. We used recycled wood beams, wood planks, cardboard, plastic bottles, wires, LED lights, among the other recycled materials. It was decided that the motorized unit would be detachable from the electric griddle so that the griddle can be efficiently repurposed for other means.</p>\n<h1>The team</h1>\n<p>Our trio recently reunited specifically for this hackathon. Our team met in high school over half a decade ago but have since headed our separate ways to pursue our careers. We have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Timothy Lock on Front End</li>\n<li>Bryan Wong on Firmware Back End</li>\n<li>Jessica Ip on Back End/Electrical Engineer</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Printcakes: Pancake Printer</h2>\n<p>The possibilities are endless but the areas of improvement we are focusing on next include: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smooth android interfacing functionality </li>\n<li>Multiple color and shade support</li>\n<li>More pre-programmed images</li>\n<li>Improvements in portability of machine and branding</li>\n<li>Improvements in consistency and accuracy of the nozzle</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>You batter come by and check us out!</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Timothylock/PancakePrinter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Timothylock/PancakePrinter\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I took data from the Java interface and translated it into motor and pump movements using an arduino.

However, this great length of time is often caused by technical requirements more than anything else.</p>\n<p>The iOS app icon process is no exception to this. To add an icon to the phone's home screen to test, the entire app needs to be recompiled, and dozens of different icon sizes need to be made, processed, integrated, and applied to the new app; repeated every time a simple change is made.</p>\n<p>This process is not only tedious, but, with the many revisions that final product branding and artwork goes through before release, but greatly time wasting.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Enter Icns. Icns (pronounced \"icons\", named after the Mac OS file extension for app icon images), seamlessly integrates the app icon revisions on your computer with the home screen on your phone. Utilizing icns, the process of testing an icon on-device is reduced from many minutes to only a few seconds, over time saving hours or even days as the many icon revisions can be tested and reviewed almost immediately. Most popular image formats (including Photoshop files) can be transmitted immediately from icns' Mac app to the companion iOS client, and from there installed on the home screen; without worrying about converting to different sizes or formats.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The Icns Mac and iOS clients are both built in a hybrid of Objective-C and Swift, utilizing Parse as the database and general backend software. Final processing and verification on the image is then handled by a private server, and shipped to the device. When an image is provided to the Mac App, a connection is facilitated between this app the user's account on the Parse database. The parse database then communicates to the iPhone app that an icon has requested installation. The image is then processed and verified by a personal server before being installed on the chosen device. (This entire process normally takes less than 30 seconds).</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Though the majority of the project was rather straightforward, the actual installation of the icon would not work with traditional methods. Eventually, a separate piece of server software, separate from Parse, was created to complete the final installation of the icon, and installed on an existing server. In order to eliminate server load on an otherwise already taxed machine, the contents of the icon are encoded and transferred to the phone as a base64 string, and then installed, offloading this taxing process to the phone rather than the server.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Using and ensuring the cooperation between two clients, Parse, and a private server was difficult, but enjoyable. It was the final piece of the puzzle to get the entire system working, marking the entrance into much easier and more straightforward UI improvements.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This seemingly simple app proved itself to be surprisingly complicated in regards to the amount of different technologies required to get the system working. This experience will no doubt prove itself to be useful in the future, whenever it is needed to utilize many different technologies for a common purpose.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I wrote the iOS and Mac apps, and set up the Parse and general server backends.", ""]], ["Pixel Board", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pixel Board \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/729/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pixel Board \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/730/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pixel Board \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/731/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pixel Board \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/732/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>We wanted to build a modular and cross platform printer.</h2>\n<h2>It moves along the Cartesian grid plan and draws on a board</h2>\n<h2>We found someone who was experienced with CAD to create custom wheels and brackets for us. Once printed out, we mounted wheels above the whiteboard upper ledge and on top of the whiteboard marker/eraser tray. It's connected with a bracket and the bottom wheel is motor controlled, allowed the whole system to move horizontally. On the beam connecting the upper and lower wheels, there is a board with a marker that can imprint a pixel on the board at any coordinate point, and this board is capable of moving vertically. Combined, this allows the printer to navigate all around the whiteboard.</h2>\n<h2>Besides waiting 12 hours to 3D print some stuff, we had to figure out the best materials to make this an efficient and possible solution.

Nothing effectively useful has been achieved yet, until now...\nLifeboard was created for social change.  To change how people interact and have conversations.  It opens as a gateway to help the common individual be able to approach situations they may not normally know exactly how to deal with.  Those in tech industry might seem like they've got it made, but long hours, isolation, and stress put them at risk of mental illness.  The most direct way to help individuals affected by depression is to lead the conversation.  Lifeboard lets you do that without even leaving your conversation.

We wasted trips to the local furniture store because the look and feel of the furniture in the store doesn't really apply to real world scenario, and we would mess up the measurement for the small college dorm rooms. We just wanted something that would make purchasing new furniture and renovations for one's living space easier.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>-Provide a way to visualize project environment - i.e. building a garden, renovating an office\n-Allows the user to easily and quickly input the parameters/environment through a simple picture.\n-Gives people the freedom to access a giant database of Walmart furniture and items, and also ratings and supports.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the app using cross platform web technology, used the Firebase API to create a instant communication device and brought in the Walmart API to use their merchandise data. The web app is currently hosted on Azure Cloud platform based on nodeJS server framework.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Making the application interactive and intuitive for users to navigate through selection of furnitures, and figuring out how to make it as realistic as possible with current resources.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting the Walmart API to function properly with the firebase real-time communication. We were finally able to access the Walmart merchandise info from our developed firebase framework</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about the how different API's interacted with each other and how to manipulate html elements using Javascript.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Visualeyes</h2>\n<p>-Provide 1-on-1 product recommendation and collaboration with Real Time Visualeyes.\n-Gives users recommendations based on what they have previously purchased and their existing style.</p>\n<h2>Best Domain Submission</h2>\n<p>visualey.es</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built

Finally, the JSON files are uploaded to firebase directly from the python script when they are created.\nThe app takes the data and sorts it to present it to the user: using the Mio armband's sensors and the phone's gps, the app determines what direction the user points in and constructs a circular sector; since location data already filters by radius, we only need to check that each point is counter-clockwise of the initial side and clockwise of the terminal side of the sector.

Just <strong>tell us an event you want to go</strong> and we'll provide you with a comprehensive trip itinerary and the fastest booking experience you've ever had. Presented in an extremely attractive UI/UX, <strong>we book your flight, hotel, and Uber all in one integrated purchase, with just <em>one click</em></strong>.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We started with the Uber API  and requested price and time estimates. Then we repeated this process for the Expedia and QPX APIs. This was all initially built in Flask but then we realized that it  would be faster if it was done asynchronosly so we had to research that and build it using Twisted and Klein frameworks, which at first brought down the time for the API calls significantly. This was all combined to form json objects that were then passed to the frontend where they were parsed and placed accordingly.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenges were definitely parsing the json objects as there was a lot of information in them and figuring out which parameters to pass. The next most difficult was switching from synchronous Flask to asynchronous Twisted and Klein for the API calls. JSON parsing on the fronted also became a challenge because there were a lot of parameters to be parsed and displayed in different parts of the code. This was in addition to exhaustion, sleep deprivation and unhappiness over missing Saturday\u2019s home game :(.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The API's pass information well from the back-end to the front-end and the UI/UX is absolutely beautiful. In addition to all the coding, we were able to build an entire brand around our hack by creating a unique logo, slogan, and social-media presence on Facebook and Twitter. We even spent a bunch of time doing Customer Discovery interviews with 18 fellow hackers and sponsors to validate our business model and pivot on our hypothesis. Most importantly, we worked extremely well together as a team, communicated effectively throughout, and powered through 36 hours of consecutive hacking!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>All of the above. None of us had done anything like this before.</p>\n<h2>What's next for xplor</h2>\n<p>After MHacks, we hope to deploy our first proof-of-concept prototype onto our website. Next, we're going to refine our front/back-end and finish the things we didn't have time to do at MHacks. From there, we hope to review our business model, establish as an LLC, and move forward as a startup with a fully operational product. In doing so, we hope to employ Customer Development and Lean Startup methodologies in order to ensure we have a valid product-market fit. In searching for a repeatable and scalable business model, we plan to seek mentorship from the University of Michigan entrepreneurial community. We plan to take this as far it will go.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/expedia\">expedia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-flight</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eventful\">eventful</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://xplor.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://xplor.xyz\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>xplor.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["BattleTrip", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>5 pivots later, a good group brainstorm leads to hype.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Uber riders are now engaged in a game of <strong>Battleship!</strong> As they get rides around the city, their final destinations are geographically checked against premade 'battleships.'

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Television shows often have laugh tracks or similar sound effects to guide a viewer's reactions. DaReactTV allows people to have a more visually stimulating television experience. Humans are sympathetic by nature, especially at moments of high emotion, and such images will allow people to enjoy their viewing experience further while bonding with other viewers. We were in part inspired by YouTube react videos and other forms of social media such as Twitter and Snapchat, as we realized that seeing other people's reactions to something is in itself amusing and can draw more attention to the subject matter. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>DaReactTV allows people to submit their reactions to certain dramatic points in a television show or movie as they watch it, and will place them back at those points in future runs of the show/movie. The images will fade in and out and be placed on the borders of the screen to minimize distraction from the show/movie itself. These reactions will function similar to crowd scenes at sports events, by making the subject matter more interesting and the audience more engaged, and giving people who have seen a show before a whole new viewing experience the next time they see the show again. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We connected a webcam with Intel Edison, and use it to take pictures of viewers at preset times. These images are uploaded into our database and later queried and shown on-screen at the same times.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Connecting the webcam, circumventing limitations in knowledge/technology</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We met (and mentored in Tim's case) a lot of people, and learned a lot of new things. We transcended many platforms, including hardware, databases, and television.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Dora learned how to do database stuff and some basic JavaScript. Jared and Timotius learned about how to program with a Directv set-top box and more problem-solving skills. </p>\n<h2>What's next for DaReactTV</h2>\n<p>We would like to include a way of screening the images for appropriateness, and perhaps include a text-based medium as well, such as a live chat or live tweeting capability. We want to introduce user accounts and a social networking capability where you can add people into your group and see reactions specifically from members of the group.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">directv</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tv</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webcam</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">centos7</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jrdbnntt/DaReactTV\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jrdbnntt/DaReactTV\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote JavaScript and worked on database stuff for the first time!", "", ""]], ["MYOwn Drums", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UaA11pGUyFo?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MYOwn Drums \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/282/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MYOwn Drums \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/283/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MYOwn Drums \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/284/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MYOwn Drums \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/296/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MYOwn Drums \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/297/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We as a group were interested in using MYO armbands to create a cool project.

All of the drums are played by movements recorded by the arm bands. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We decided that the Unity game engine was the quickest way to start programming the MYO, as it provided us with an intuitive interface that we could design the drum set in. We imported a open source drum set as a .blend file and used that as a basis for our project. We then connected a MYO band to Unity and used a modified example as the drumstick. We used collisions in Unity to determine when to play the drum sounds. After we were able to create this functionality, we added a second MYO / second drumstick to simulate a drummer playing in real life.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our first problem was figuring out how to use Unity. None of us had used it before, so we spent most of the first night looking at documentation, searching the internet, and finding out what Unity provided us. We also had the challenge of figuring out the MYO band API, but with the documentation readily available on the MYO website, that was an easier task. We also had to figure out the difficulties of creating sounds based on collisions. It took a while, but we finally got it. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to create a working drum set that we were able to play our favorite riffs on. The biggest satisfaction came from being able to recreate Phill Connely's famous drum part  in our program. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned that game development is a lot harder that it seems. We also learned that no matter how cool a new technology may seem, it still has its limitations, which influences the design of your project a lot. </p>\n<h2>What's next for MYOwn Drums</h2>\n<p>Create a more responsive interface, and different kinds of drums. We would also like to incorporate even more gestures that would allow the user to move their drumsticks in the x, y, and z directions rather than just pivot about an axis. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iamktam/MYOwnDrums\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/iamktam/MYOwnDrums\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["Picapic", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Picapic \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/384/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Picapic \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/385/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Picapic \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/386/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Picapic \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/387/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When you go to a birthday party, wedding, fireworks, hackathon or any event, Imagine the staggering number of people taking pictures.

If you're lucky, you _ might _ get a parking spot in the back corner of the farthest parking lot on campus if you wait long enough. Students at impacted universities everywhere take part in a similar daily ritual. At schools like Florida State University and UC San Diego, eager student drivers will often anxiously follow their peers in parking lots, hoping to catch a newly available parking spot. Some even block traffic, awaiting their turn to park. </p>\n<p>Please don't do this. <strong>Just use Spot Swap.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Spot Swap is a cross-platform mobile application that simplifies the process of finding parking for students. Students who need parking spaces are matched with with a peer looking to hitch a ride to their cars from other parts of campus. \nAt the conclusion of the impromptu ride share, the driver gets the opportunity to commandeer his passenger's parking spot!</p>\n<p>In effect, the app creates mutual benefit for both parties. Also, fewer students sit idle, blocking the flow of traffic. Students may also save money otherwise spent on uber, taxi fair, or bus fair getting from one side of campus to their car. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>After overhearing some students raving about Ionic on the bus ride here, we decided to give the framework a shot. Because most of us had very little experience developing mobile applications, it was much easier to use languages and technologies we were more familiar with. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>That being said, none of us are javascript experts. The team skill-set run deeps in many other web technologies: django, python, java, and ruby on rails to name a few. Much of the new HTML5/CSS3/Javascript syntax had to be picked up on the fly, slowing down progress and development. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I consider throwing together a mostly functional cross-mobile platform application that fits a social need in 36 hours, without very much prior experience developing for mobile, a huge accomplishment. It really is a testament to the dedication and ability of the individuals in our team. Now that we are all more familiar with these new technologies, I'm excited to see what we will develop in future hackathons. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>If you have an idea, no feature is impossible. Don't know Swift or Objective-C? Haven't used Android Studio? Doesn't matter. Somebody out there has solved this problem and built a cross-platform framework for developers to code in their language of choice. You just have to choose to try. Dedication wins.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SpotSwap</h2>\n<p>We are excited about future of our mobile application. Some potential features include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integration with Google Maps API (alpha)</li>\n<li>Integration with Twilio API </li>\n<li>An interface not unlike uber, in which drivers are notified when their driver is approaching and can monitor said approach visually. </li>\n<li>Live spot count per parking garage</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Hokie House", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Not getting to talk enough about college sports</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It brings people together globally and creates a unified network for which to follow Virginia Tech football</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using the Sublime text editor and with the help of NameCheap and FireBase</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Complications with NameCheap and FireBase, complexity of chat room implementation</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Overcame chat room and major functionality issues</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Many new aspects of HTML5 and CSS for front-end web development</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hokie House</h2>\n<p>Expanding more on Virginia Tech college activities and social life</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">embed</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/namecheap\">namecheap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://hokiehouse.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hokiehouse.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hokiehouse.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["It was a mutual process where my team member and I worked cooperatively throughout the project.

We've seen many professors each with a different protocol for accepting homework submissions. Some may just prefer a Blackboard submission, others a ftp submission to a web server, and some may even require a push to git repos. We set out to combine the best of these methods into a single api that went above and beyond to make everyone's lives easier.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Git Grader allows professors to register an account and set up their courses through our online portal. They may then invite their students via email to register under their courses. Under these courses the professor may add projects and multiple repositories for each one. Using git, students can pull these repos, finish the assignment, and then push the finished assignment back. Then, using docker, our server runs their code and compares their projects input/output with the expected input/output provided by the professor to assign the student a grade. This allows students to get instant feedback on their work and decrease the workload of professors and TAs who otherwise would need to compile and run each student's project separately. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our project was built using sails.js for the backend server and mithril for the frontend. This project was almost entirely javascript from front to back and was an awesome learning experience for to experience some lesser known frameworks.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>At first there was a huge learning curve for us when starting to build our project. Since these were new frameworks for each of us, simple mistakes quickly became huge headaches. However, soon the project gained momentum and pieces started falling into place. Specifically we ran into challenges learning how these environments handle actions such as CORS requests and routing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the progress we were able to make on this project and the amount we learned from it. This idea started out as a reach with the only goal being the knowledge gained along the way. While we certainly learned a lot about these new frameworks, we were actually able to release a functioning demo of our idea. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Git Grader</h2>\n<p>Git Grader is just in its demo phase right now, but we believe it still has potential to be of great use to many instructors and students. From here, we want to add a more appealing gui and implement full functionality to edit profiles, courses, and projects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sails-js\">sails.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mithril</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/backbone-js\">backbone.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/GitGraded/gitgraded-backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/GitGraded/gitgraded-backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/GitGraded/gitgraded-frontend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/GitGraded/gitgraded-frontend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Backend baby!

We love first person shooter games and paintball, and we saw the Google Cardboard as a chance to create this experience in real life.  Imagine being able to play a hardcore game of paintball anytime, anywhere, without the mess.  pARfs strives to make social gaming more immersive by allowing players to compete anywhere!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>pARfs allows social and immersive gaming by allowing users to play an augmented reality first person shooter anytime, anywhere.  It overlays an AR UI onto the camera view and communicates with a custom gun controller and Firebase server.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The frontend is designed with Unity3D using the Google Cardboard API for Android.  The custom gun controller is created with Arduino and synched to our Unity3D application to control it.  Furthermore, Unity3D is hooked up to a Firebase API (via the restAPI) to allow multiplayer capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into numerous problems during this hack.  Firstly, we had to use the restAPI and HTTP requests to communicate with Firebase because Unity3D doesn't have a Firebase client.  We also had difficulties creating the custom controllers using IR sensors with a certain amount of accuracy/forgiveness.  Lastly, we had difficulties getting the Arduino to communicate with Android.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm very proud that we managed to get the Firebase servers working for Unity3D, and that we got all of the parts of the project working together to create an amazing immersive experience.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about Firebase, using external APIs with Unity3D, using SerialPorts in an Android environment, and how to use Arduino to create cool hardware experiences.</p>\n<h2>What's next for pARfs</h2>\n<p>We plan to update the gun controller to work with bluetooth for easier integration.  We also plan to release our app on the Android Store for a cool DIY project, open source the project, and make an Instructables of how to make your own gun controller.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/walmart-open\">walmart-open</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">restapi</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Unity3D mechanics, helped with the Arduino, and interfaced the Arduino with Unity.", "Created base UI for google cardboard in Unity as well as got firebase rest api to work in Unity.

We went around and asked over 50 MHacks participants if they played fantasy sports and only one person said yes. We learned that the reason that people didn\u2019t play is because everything is too complicated. We focus on creating a unique fantasy experience where you can add as many players to your lineup as long as you do not go over your budget. These games are focused on single sporting events so that you can play while watching with your friends.</p>\n<p>The second part of the inspiration which makes our product unique is that there is no commission fees that will be taken. We have seen in the past couple years companies like FanDuel and DraftKing have validated the market for individuals that want to put money into fantasy sports. They make their money based on taking a 10-20% fee. We have seen companies like Robinhood and Credit Karma provide services for free and build a large user base of individuals who love their product and have generated revenue through other innovative business models. We believe that there is potential for disruption in the fantasy sports world through utilizing a business model with similar aspects that focuses on eliminating commissions and passing on savings to the end user. </p>\n<p>The purpose of the Hackathon for us was to come together and create something that is innovative and disruptive and so we were inspired to create Scoutkick.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Scoutkick is an iOS game that allows you to, every night, make simple draft picks for a selected sports game. You can also make groups and challenge your Facebook friends. The picks \u2018freeze\u2019 30 minutes before the event, and results are displayed after the game is finished.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We decided to go mobile first and focus on just an iPhone app to demonstrate the basic functionality -- seeing at an upcoming game, creating groups and inviting friends, and picking players within your nightly budget. Along with our iOS app written in Swift, we built an API backend in Rails and PostgreSQL. Although Rails is suited better for larger, monolithic apps, Rails was the quickest way for our team to manage some data models and expose a few endpoints. Finally, we added a fronted splash page in Ember.js displaying some metrics through d3 charts with real data about NFL players.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Although we started our Rails project with a fairly comprehensive integration spec, it was hard to build a client (iOS) and server (Rails) somewhat independently for the first 24 hours and then \u2018Flip the switch\u2019 hope that everything matches up. Minor things like inviting multiple users at once and accepting group invites were a few oversights.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We finished a MVP in only 36 hours, which is as much as we could hope for. More than that though, we really met a lot of great people along the way, which made this event seriously rewarding.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the value of \u2018scope reduction\u2019 -- when starting a \u2018seemingly simple\u2019 project like this, my first thought would be to write an iOS and Android simultaneously, but had we gone down that road we never would have finished on time. It's good to start small! Although we only have an iOS client, and the user interface is somewhat incomplete, it is at least a real app that we can start using and iterating on.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Scoutkick</h2>\n<p>The next step for Scoutkick is to use this product for the Monday Night Football game with a small group of individuals. From there were are going to make iterations to the product to further enhance the user experience so that individuals will want to continually use it. Currently, we are focusing only on single sporting events with your friends, but in the future we will implement payment systems (Paypal, Bitcoin) so that people can play for money. We plan to eventually make money through charging for premium features such as if people want to play more complex fantasy matches. Another potential business model is through advertising since we have a unique opportunity to engage with users that go through steps to ultimately compete for money in a sporting event.

Facebook has become a powerful source for people to band together to tackle a variety of topics, it has given us a platform to reconnect with old friends and maintain relations with current and new friends regardless of geographical location.  However despite all the benefits and tools that Facebook makes available to us, Facebook is still subject to all the negativity that exists on the Internet.  This is the main inspiration for our hack.  <strong>We want our hack to help refocus the attention away from all the negativity that exists on Facebook and back to all the benefits of the community that exists on there.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We all have experienced times where we had promised to never do something again.  Ever.  And then we find ourselves in that exact same situation again at a later time.\nOr times where we had a realization that our current life style could definitely be better, so we promise to do better, but never actually change any behavior or successfully keep it.</p>\n<p>For all these broken promises and unfulfilled goals, we present the app, My Bad Habit--a way for you to finally tackle all those changes you promised you would do, but never did.  </p>\n<p>In the app, you can make a <strong>pledge</strong> to do something like \"Living a more active life\".  You can write a description about the pledge (\"I will run, walk, or jog outside at least an hour a day\").  Lastly, the most important part is to determine how you will show that you've held up your pledge daily (\"At the end of each hour of activity, I will post a picture of an interesting landmark that I passed during my workout\").  This pledge will then be posted on your Facebook wall.  When you are ready to submit a <strong>proof</strong>, another post will be put on your Facebook wall.  Your friends will see your activity and be able to help and encourage your attempt of completing your pledges.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using the Parse and Facebook APIs, we integrated Facebook into our Android app</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Figuring out the in and outs of the tools we decided to use was a challenge especially when some of the documentation were out of date.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're really proud of the fact that our app looks quite decent and it actually works.  The Facebook integration once it was successfully is really satisfying.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to integrate Facebook into Android apps and better understanding of Android development</p>\n<h2>What's next for My Bad Habit</h2>\n<p>Fixing up the UI, make sure permissions are obtained correctly so we can eventually release it, submit to Facebook for review on our OpenGraph, add additional features that supplements the basic functionality, and release and find how we can make our app better by seeing how people interact with it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.gatech.edu/ssu36/15MHacks6\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.gatech.edu/ssu36/15MHacks6\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.gatech.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["forests", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>During the API expo, the <code>Parse</code> API caught our interest and with the way data gains more and more importance every day, we wanted to see how far we can take the <code>Parse</code> API in terms of portability and applicability</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app(s) provide multiple ways to use and <strong>visualize <em>Bloomberg</em> data</strong> from a <code>Parse</code> Database.

Mercury &amp; Co's name is derived from the Roman God Mercury, who is linked to the Latin word <em>merx</em>, reminiscent of merchandise, trade, and wages. We at Mercury strive to bring new levels of e-commerce to users through price metrics and a user-first platform. </p>\n<p>Why Mercury? Unlike other e-commerce management panels, we can generate accurate price histories for other companies (hence the &amp; Co!), even without any prior records. Furthermore, Mercury provides automatic semantic notifications and statistics with context on sales of items in your cart, without you lifting a finger. Our platform will guide you to the best dates, locations, and easiest ways to get what you want for less. Mercury is a responsive platform that aims to bring a new lens to e-commerce worldwide.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Universal Price History - Mercury can provide price history records for any e-commerce site, whether or not they have existing records or not. </li>\n<li>Visualize metrics - We call on Wolfram Alpha to output attractive, informative graphs with tangible data derived from past prices, competitors, and web activity.</li>\n<li>Omnichannel Presence - As a responsive web app, we cover the full spectrum of devices. Maximizes conversion rates by enhancing the shopping experience.</li>\n<li>Semantic Notifications - All of our data collected is presented in a matter that is understandable and relevant. Instead of spamming you every time a price fluctuates, Mercury understands the context and lets you know when it matter.</li>\n<li>Check-out - Mercury compares the prices of different brands and stores and walks you through the check out process. Either order online or find your local store.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges &amp; Comebacks</h2>\n<p>Calibrating the price tracking process was complicated since websites regularly make large updates to websites which move elements around. In addition, learning Wolfram was slow progress, but with several hours of mentorship we proved successful.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/walmart-open\">walmart-open</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mercuryand.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mercuryand.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mercuryand.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://danielpark.me/mercury/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://danielpark.me/mercury/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>danielpark.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/4ExlXxO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://i.imgur.com/4ExlXxO.jpg\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>i.imgur.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Designed the site and web scraper, worked on aggregating api links and automated graphing and statical analysis of data\n", "", ""]], ["Cosmic Wave", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cosmic Wave \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/432/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I am really passionate about bringing data connectivity to people that live in areas where data infrastructure is non existent.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Call a number and it describes it to you!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>For Twilio, there was no way to play a sound or record while on call.

The mission statement for the club has been to promote the culture of civic engagement in the youth of India and to help them critically analyze the political and social condition in India. Recently we expanded from Purdue chapter to target schools in India and aim to receive increased participation from students back there. \nIndia has still been struggling to break loose from the shackles of social stigma and dogma. The sole aim of the program is to help empower the youth to take informed decisions. </p>\n<p>Through this portal my teammate and I envision to expand to all corners where the voice of youth could help them better themselves and make a place in the society. It might not bring a drastic social change, but would definitely help in the process of stimulating the same.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our portal is an online debating platform where people can freely and, at the same time, respectfully air their views while being exposed to varied viewpoints from around the world. This would help them to learn from various viewpoints from different societies and cultural background.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Backend was outsourced to Parse. Using the parse API we made a really beautified client side for the users to debate on. For the front end we made extensive use of javaScript and JQuery libraries. This made the UI really appealing and enhanced the UX. </p>\n<p>We have maintained a system of ending debates within a given time frame to avoid the debate from becoming a clutter-some and conclusion less.

We agree, Anuraag.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hackatron is a web app built for helping programmers at hackathons. Hackers seeking help can submit a request in the app by filling out a brief form. Hackers looking to help others see a list of all active help requests and can quickly respond to topics in which they have expertise.</p>\n<p>To verify users, Google, GitHub, and Facebook are available as login providers. This makes getting the user's name and picture trivial (both are critical in allowing the requester and helper to identify each other in person).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Hackatron is built using Meteor, which allows for easy use of plugins for OAuth and templating.</p>\n<p>Users seeking help enter their information into the request form, from which the information is stored into a database (powered by MongoDB). That information is then displayed in the \"Help Out\" pane.</p>\n<p>The platform is hosted on a dedicated server and deployed with Deis.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CSS animations turned out to be more complicated than anticipated</li>\n<li>Getting scaling working on all screen sizes &amp; DPIs</li>\n<li>Making the app approachable, but discouraging low quality submissions</li>\n<li>Having to pivot multiple times</li>\n<li>Didn't have enough time to build our entire vision out</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Survived the cold and sleep deprivation, kind of</li>\n<li>Got transitions working</li>\n<li>Designed the app very well (in our opinion)</li>\n<li>Made a really cool product</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Hackathons are ...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a good way to network with potential employers</li>\n<li>the fastest way to learn new technologies</li>\n<li>the best way to meet other hackers</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Hackatron</h2>\n<p>We want to see Hackatron implemented at future hackathons to encourage further collaboration between competing teams and enhance learning.</p>\n<p>To entice hackers to help, there will be a points and ranking system. Those asking good questions and those helping out will receive points. Additionally, those seeking help can place bounties on their requests, transferring points from the requester to the helper. Hackathons could further incite collaborative behavior between teams by offering a prize for the team or individual with the most points.</p>\n<h2>Source code</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/thewashingtonredskins/hackatron\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kubernetes</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">deis</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scss\">scss</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dokku</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typeform\">typeform</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coffeescript\">coffeescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oauth\">oauth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docker\">docker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://hackitronapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hackitronapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackitronapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["UX design, logo, images, some web development", "I wrote the code!", ""]], ["Native CSS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>NativeCSS</h1>\n<p>NativeCSS is a CSS engine for styling iPhone and iPad apps. We all know CSS, so why not put it to work making our\napps look beautiful?</p>\n<h1>Over-The-Air CSS Editing</h1>\n<p>In addition to bundling CSS with the application executable at compile time, NativeCSS also makes it easy to\nwirelessly edit the CSS in any app without recompiling. With a simple TCP connection between the iOS device\nand a separate computer, CSS can be instantly changed and the changes are immediately visible.</p>\n<h1>Example</h1>\n<p>The first step is to import the <code>NativeCSS.h</code> header file</p>\n<pre class=\"language-objectivec\"><code>#import \"NativeCSS.h\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, in the <code>viewDidLoad</code> method of a view controller, setup your CSS file parser:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-objectivec\"><code>// Create a file object from the bundle\nNativeCSSFile *file = [[NativeCSSFile alloc] initWithFilename:@\"style.css\"];\n\n// Add some view -- a header -- to the view\nUIView *header = [[UIView alloc] init];\nheader.cssIdentifier = @\"header\";\n[self.view addSubview:header];\n\n// Add another view -- a button -- to the view\nUIButton *button = [[UIButton alloc] init];\n[button addCssClass:@\"button\"];\n[self.view addSubview:button];\n\n// Apply the CSS file to the view controller\n[self.view styleWithCSS:file];\n</code></pre>\n<h1>The CSS Code</h1>\n<p>The CSS code used for the framework is syntactically identical to CSS used for the web. Here is a \nsample that could style the above view controller contents:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\"><code>UIButton.button\n{\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    border: 1px solid #CCC;\n    background-color: #EEE;\n    color: #000;\n    font-family: \"Arial\";\n}\n\nUIView#header\n{\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 64px;\n    left: 0;\n    top: 0;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Notes about CSS format</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Tag names, like in browser CSS, are not required.

The web app will also show additional data of travel times and location information. Also, just for fun the app will determine gender and produce a new id for the person to use if they want and call them and play the national anthem of the country they are traveling to.

The interface had to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate through. Say hello to Simplify. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Simplify allows people to easily call, send pre-set messages, order food, and more! The app is primarily dedicated toward the elderly - the buttons were made with a very simple interface to ensure that everyone could use it. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Over the course of the 36 hours, we first started with a design of the layout (i.e. how we wanted the workflow of the app to be). This took us ~2 hours or so. After we had a design to work with, we went to building the iOS application, ~4 hours. After we had basic functionality down, we started implementing the front-end in ~6 hours. The front end was designed primarily in Sketch;  the goal was just to make the app very clean. From there, we spent a lot of time messing around with backend calls (utilizing Parse + cloud code). The rest of the time, we made a video and website to highlight our application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Uber's API definitely through our team for a loop. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to integrate the \"Ride Request\" functionality into our application. Additionally, we got distracted - we constantly wanted to implement new features without recognizing what the user would actually need. For future development, we should definitely understand our market better. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I've very happy that we were able to build our product in 36 hours. Initially, it seemed like the scope of our project was too large, but we were able to identify core features to include/finish. I think our team also worked well together (2 primary developers + 2 front-end designers). We were able to split up the tasks well, and there was never a moment where anyone was left sitting around. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We need more iOS developers for future projects. With only one developer, there were too many things to implement in the 36 hours. The project was a great way to test new APIs, and I think we'll be able to use them in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Simplify</h2>\n<p>There's still a lot of functionality that we want to add to Simplify including:\nQuick travel booking\nUI touch ups\nRemote favorites contact replacement </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/echenyu/Simplify-\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/echenyu/Simplify-\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://simplifyme.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://simplifyme.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>simplifyme.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the iOS application and worked on the front end side of things.

Campus and various student clubs would try their best to print out posters and stick them everywhere. Many students walk past it and don't get a proper look at it. There are a lot of supplies and time going to waste for these student clubs because of this situation. No more slowing down to squint at a poster on your way to class. This is where I say a way of connecting both students and club associations together by creating a centralized platform. Hence, the idea Eventurous was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It helps university students easily view and get updated with all the new events taking place on campus, and for student associations to showcase their events efficiently.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I started off by designing and mimicking the look of how posters look. From there, I wrote user stories, and created models for the backend. Using that for a foundation it was time to write the first line of code, however, I recently discovered a service called Stamplay and wanted to use it to create an application as it with make it easier to maintain, and I got most of the app working from just a few clicks. After following some tutorials and countless hours of debugging, I finally has something running.

I always felt that Google Now could go a few steps further in making Android better and along with my team, we decided that we would create something that would fill the space that Google Now leaves</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SemAndTricks essentially does two things. One, it monitors your app usage so that it can predict when and where you are going to use what app, and add that to your lock screen, making it super convenient and direct for you to access the app you are most likely to use in a certain situation. For example, if you use the gmail app at 10am at your work every weekday, then the next time you are in the same situation, GMail can be directly accessed from your home screen. Or say you are at an amazing tourist destination and you suddenly want to take a snap for Snapchat, you will find the Snapchat app conveniently added to your lock screen as a widget, so you can get instant access and you don't miss a single moment.\nThe second feature is just as impressive. The app will monitor your text messages to understand your behavior and moods, and whenever it notices a spike, it will give you recommendations that will help deal with the spike. This is effectively a very targeted advertising tool that works wonders for the user too (imagine breaking up and getting a discount coupon for a bar at the same night).\nWith these two implemented features, and some others in the pipeline, this app is the tool you need, so that your device actually understands you and shapes itself to work better for you.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We have an Azure SQL and machine learning server running for the first feature. The machine learning helps cluster similar users (to provide a better means to distribute advertisements/alerts/common notifications to similar users). It also helps us identify the app the person will be using next based on his past usage data. We used a K-means clustering for the first thing and a multi variable random forest for the second. This was paired up with the android app, on which we had to do some hacky things to monitor the android system and to properly connect the app to Azure (not as easy as it originally seemed) </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One particular challenge was that monitoring currently running apps is a very tough task on Android and there were no tutorials as such.

However, we have discovered a deficiency in systems integration with the hardware and thus, decided to explore the Parrot AR Drone. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The question in some way is flawed in that it is asking simply, 'what it does?'. Truthfully answering, it does not do anything, or at least anything immediately impactful or seen.  Similarly, the idea of Galileo of a heliocentric solar system, where the earth revolves around the Sun. It did not mean anything, and worse, was treated as a sin. Although, time has proven this concept to be true, nothing would change the fact that it was under appreciated. Akin to the past, drones and drone technology are treated negatively through bureaucracy and media . What 'it' does is systems integration of state-of-the-art-technology with drones? And I reckon to be less impactful or inspirational than others, is a major milestone with technologies. The ability to interact with a multitude of new technologies creating a new platform and level of interaction with drones and those alike are some of it's most immediate doings.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This forward-looking hack was built using Node.JS, Parrot AR Drone 2.0 SDK and Parrot Drone, Myo, and Azure. More importantly, it could not have been built as well as it is without help and support from my peers. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Challenges have brought both excitement and angst to the Hackathon expeience. OpenCV, interacting with Muse and the Myo has provided us the mental challenge for which we have come to MHacks. Initially we wanted to create a program that will allow the drone to follow a person safely front-view, and capture images and film, as well as serve as a security measure to be used for interacting with the police or others in the case of an emergency. We had much difficulty integrating facial recognition software to the drone for it to be able to navigate safely, and thus have chosen not to pursue it.  Similar difficulties were faced with the Muse, however, was different, as it was an inherent problem with the input sensitivity and accuracy of the Muse to be engineered and designed for safety. Adamantly wanting to be successful, we persevered with the Myo Armband to be able to interface with the Drone with accuracy. Numerous test cases were used to study the most accurate gesture to be used for the most critical phases of the flight, and programmed the Parrot AR Drone to respond likewise. We can sincerely say, that the end justified the means all through times of difficulty and accomplishment. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Given that we had many challenges, one major milestone was the ability to automate the flight using Node.JS and perform 3D acrobatics with ease. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This has been a behemoth roller coaster ride, brought by new experiences and new knowledge. We have learned many things from one drone. This ranges from Node.JS, learning to use the Myo, and most fun, how to fly a quadcopter. We were amazed that we learned many aspects in back-end and server and diverse database servers in the market for hosting.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hello Drone!</h2>\n<p>Taking up a challenge of tackling systems integration from the base case of a large scope offers broad impacts\nThe next level of Hello Drone is to implement a 'higher level of recursion.' Applications such as topographical mapping, live video streaming for cloud services. Topographical mapping will revolutionized the geodetic and infrastructure industry by being given an alternative open system to map the world around them in 3D. This would make surveying land boundaries and mapping at-large, more affordable, detailed, and direct to end users. To further this, it will continue on to provide detailed infrastructure studies giving means for us to engineer the optimal location of infrastructures regarding traffic. These cloud services would enable any end-users to have the experience of a drone owner/enthusiast as well as an opportunity to view the world with a completely different perspective, for adventurers and explorers alike. New angles and automated operation of the drone would also be highly transferrable to the film industry, whether you are a film enthusiast or a professional film maker. In turn, reducing costs to redundant private bird's eye view filming.  The future for Hello Drone is boundless!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">drone</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parrot\">parrot</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on exposing hardware data using 3rd party APIs and took videos of the project.", "", "", ""]], ["WordHunter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As people who live lives immersed in technology, we have spent quite a bit of time browsing the internet for information. Often times we end up looking for that information in news articles and tech journals. The problem is that you can wander for quite a while trying to find an article that is actually what you are looking for. That sprang into the idea to find a way to guide that process through peers. To avoid all of the unnecessary articles and get to what you want.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WordHunter is a search engine designed specifically for browsing websites that host journals and other articles. It takes in a search term and then finds synonyms for that word. From there, it takes those synonyms and compares them to all of the keywords for articles stored in its database. Those matches are then used to pull 3 articles: the most relevant, the highest reviewed, and a random article within the selection. Those articles are then displayed to choose from and read. After reading the article, the user can then give it a thumbs up or down to determine how good of an article it is.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app was split into 3 parts: the UI, the back end and fully setting up the database. The UI and the back end had to communicate using RESTful services, which was made easy by the use of Backbone.js, which was chosen due to the single, dynamic page that the app was going to be. Python was used on the back end to connect to the database and the front end. As for a database, MongoDB was used. It allows easy storage of large strings and went well with this project. The database was populated with information pulled from multiple websites.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The largest challenge that we ran into came before we started our project. As we were brainstorming, this idea came up and we all liked the idea. However, none of us could think of a way to actually search all of the different sources we were looking for and then populate our own page. There was a ton of websites that could be searched, and just googling it and trying to grab that wasn't sensible. After bouncing ideas around we decided to give it a try and eventually ran into a library called Newspaper. Newspaper allowed us to choose websites and parse through their articles, picking out key words, the title and other information. That allowed us to store information into the database to use as a baseline for our application. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of how much we got done. Although we didn't quite finish everything that we wanted to, we were comfortable with where we were at the end. After spending all day Friday driving down here, we were all exhausted. We spent several hours trying to just think of a project and then all fell asleep for way longer than we should have. By the time we got truly started it felt like we had no time left. We ended up cranking out a lot of what we wanted and got to watch everything fall into place.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to take a web app from the ground up. I've gotten to work on them before, but never actually be one of the architects behind the application. It was cool to learn that new side, and then get to host it on a domain.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WordHunter</h2>\n<p>There were several things that we never got to fully finish. The math behind the ratings isn't exactly how we would have like it to be and we are missing one of our favorite parts. The idea was to include a comment board where people could say how the article helped them and what it would be useful for. In addition to that, there is an unfathomable amount of articles out there that we haven't touched. That could be expanded upon to broaden the application as well. Finally, with the addition of that many more articles, it would be a good idea to change from 3 being displayed to full pages. They could include the rating, a little comment section, and some keywords that were hit when finding the article.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">restful-web-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/backbone-js\">backbone.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/handlebars-js\">handlebars.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">newspaper-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://wordhunter.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://wordhunter.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>wordhunter.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/doylezdead/wh-web\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/doylezdead/wh-web\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/doylezdead/wh-service\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/doylezdead/wh-service\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the majority of the front end.

College is getting more and more expensive, and in an effort to prevent students from wasting money on textbooks they'll never use, we created TextBase.co!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TextBase.co is a college textbook review site intended to be as transparent as possible about the usefulness of these expensive textbooks. Students can not only gain insight about how effective certain textbooks are, they can also feel comfortable that they will be putting their money to good use when they do decide to purchase a textbook. Students can search up a textbook and see the reviews of other students. They can also leave their own reviews, and if they find a textbook that hasn't been reviewed yet, they can add that book to help future students!</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Many technologies went into building this product, most of them new to both of us. On the development side, we used Javascript, HTML and CSS. On the back-end, we used Linode to host our website and Parse to easily maintain our data. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The most obvious and frustrating challenge was syntax. Neither of us had a lot of experience with web development before MHacks, so we spent a lot of time on trial and error, trying to learn multiple new languages. Another challenge that we ran into dealt with dynamic data. Because we had to query the data from Parse, we weren't able to create static fields and simply change the values. Instead, we had to create all of the headers, buttons, text fields, etc dynamically. Doing all of this implementation and formatting was very tedious and sucked up a lot of time. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>One of our proudest accomplishments is building a running website in languages that we had no exposure to before Friday. Another accomplishment that we're proud of is one that is not so obvious yet, but it is hopefully one that will stand out in the near future, and that is the fact that we're addressing a need among students. Many students post in class Facebook pages or Reddit pages asking about certain textbooks or certain courses. However, with the hundreds and thousands of posts that show up on these sites everyday, their questions can easily get lost and forgotten. TextBase.co consolidates all of the information and allows students to find the information they are looking for.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Again, we learned a lot of different languages. However, we learned that even with Parse to make things simple, handling large amounts of data is extremely difficult and frustrating. Finally, we learned that <strong>sleep is important</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TextBase</h2>\n<p>One of the features that we wanted to implement, but didn't have enough time, was to be able to search by school. This way, a student would not have to know the title of the book. Instead, they can search up the school, then select the course, and automatically receive the review for that course's textbook. We also hope to implement a searching algorithm, instead of only testing for exact matches, like we are doing right now. Eventually, we hope that TextBase.co will be able to be linked up with end-of-term surveys, thereby providing as much information as possible. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.textbase.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.textbase.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.textbase.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did most of the JavaScript and split some of the design with Riley", "I setup the server, domain, and DNS systems.

We created an app designed to enable any guitar player to pull out their phone and create cool soundscapes- for sampling, ambient pads, or live looping. </p>\n<p>Usage: Hold the phone near the active guitar pickup(s). Manipulate the sounds created with  the application interface, physical placement, and the rest of the guitar signal chain. </p>\n<p>We spent a lot of time trying to manipulate all the different IO in a smartphone to create the most interesting sounds. The antennas, surprisingly, were not that interesting, but different kinds of resource load and screen redrawing were! \nDue to hardware differences, every device model sounds different! Phone bodies have different 'hot zones' that emit noise. </p>\n<p>Demo Video: \n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/EmabWZc8NY4\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/EmabWZc8NY4</a>\nThis is using several effects pedals seen on the pedalboard, traditionally used for electric guitar.

Our team was inspired by classic first person shooters such as Call of Duty or Halo. Drone Assault allows for a completely immersed experience for this type of game.</p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>Planes, Drones, and Tanks climb towards you, from all 360 degrees and many angles of elevation. Your task is the shoot them all down before they come close enough to do some serious damage. </p>\n<p>Each enemy character, no matter the type, travels directly towards the player. The player is given a laser cannon, which he or she can shoot by pulling the magnet trigger on the side of the cardboard device. Each enemy shot down increases the score by 10, however, each time the player allows the enemy to get close, his or her health decreases by 10. The game generates waves of enemy units, increasing by 5 unites each level. The game finishes when the player runs down the health bar to 0.</p>\n<p>At the end, the player has the option of sharing his score to Facebook. </p>\n<h2>How we built it:</h2>\n<p>Drone Assault was build using the Google Cardboard API in the Unity 3d game development environment. The game mechanics, from the shooting, to the enemies, to the scenery, was scripted using C#. Some graphics were derived from the Unity 3d graphics store. The facebook API was also used in the implementation of the share to facebook feature. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into:</h2>\n<p>Getting the right motions for each component of the game (the shooting, the travel direction of enemy units, and the orientation of player) to function in a realistic fashion was the greatest challenge. To overcome these obstacles, our team utilized many online resources, and a few built in physics packages to create an intuitive shooter game. </p>\n<h2>What we learned from this experience:</h2>\n<p>As first time users of the Unity development environment, much of our team gained huge sums of knowledge in video game scripting and programming. As version control played a huge part in our implementation, some of us have learned quite a lot about the intricacies of Git. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hduhaime/MHacks6-Cardboard/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hduhaime/MHacks6-Cardboard/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the AI for enemy targets, using c# scripting and unity prefabs to spawn enemy dronez and make them fly, crawl, or drive towards the player.

First, integrated Google Maps API can be used to explore nearby events using a map which pinpoint user's current location and the user has the ability to a draw a circumference of custom radius around himself to get a good estimate of the distance of the event. Second, is the normal list view that lists all the events in a table. Both views provides features to make an entry of the event on the calendar.\nThe iOS app borrows the idea of approval and disapproval from the app Tinder. You get random flyer or event data from our Parse backend. Swiping right leads to an entry in the Calendar whereas swiping left ignores it. The mobile app also has the list view.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We believe that we live in times where the idea of having flyers and formal printed invitation and announcements is too archaic and our Computer Science Building at Purdue is full of notice boards and a lot of flyers. We want their use to be discontinued in near future.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Breakout is a dedicated application for exploring your nearby events, parties, get togethers or getting to know about any announcements. Our mission is to give the user a variety of tools to go out - Explore, Plan and Break Free! </p>\n<h2>Why is it useful</h2>\n<p>We believe that the users can use our tools and be more explorative, adventurous and outgoing than being stuck to their phone forever.Thus, significantly uprooting the upcoming concepts of the younger generation growing a level of addiction for their mobile phones and gadgets. Also it saves a lot of paper which goes in printing event information and distributing that among a lot of people. Saves trees. Saves us.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built our application over two platforms from scratch. The web application leverages features of the AngularJS web framework and Twitter Bootstrap template designing tools. We used Parse.com as our backend. The iOS made use of Swift. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Full stack on the web project", "I made the iOS part of the Application", "Worked on the website"]], ["Holla", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Holla \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/962/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It may be just us, but often we find ourselves in a lecture, or an auditorium, looking forward to sharing something with everyone around us; however, in many cases we have not been able to do so because of the sheer size of the venues and the unlikelihood that we know everyone on social media.

However the complete opposite turned out to be true as I was unable to do so, and the people I thought I was going to team up with decided last minute their talents might be better used elsewhere. Thankfully I ran into EA and they reminded me of my true passion, and what got me here in the first place. Video games. Playing, designing, and a love for video games.</p>\n<p>My project uses the innovative new technology from EA's API and allows the user to use any smart phone (given they know the IP address) and their phone will transform into the controller before their eyes. Using your smart phone and waving it back and forth you can move the main character from left to right, and by pressing the jump or boost buttons that appear on your phone you will find the colourful ball on the computer screen doing exactly as you instruct it. Without downloading any apps, it is run only through local host WiFi, and as long as the smart phone is on the same network then the game runs quite smoothly.</p>\n<p>I built it by first downloading Unity, Node.js, Visual Basic, and EA's API. Once I had all the tools necessary I began working immediately. I programmed the interface that the user see's on their phone using Java Script, I programmed the gaming mechanics using C#, and I created the logistics of the game and placed the objects using Unity's game engine.</p>\n<p>I ran into many, many challenges this weekend and it's a miracle that I was able to finish my project before the deadline. Thank goodness for the caffeine. I had never used Unity, Node.js or C#, before this weekend and had barely worked with HTML. It was a learning curve trying to get to know everything there was that was needed for the product. Friday night I was googling what an API was. Past the learning aspect I ran into several problems with my programs. However God blessed me because there were 2 mentors in particular who gave me a helping hand at the right moments. I couldn't have done it without them.</p>\n<p>I am proud that I had the oppurtunity to be a part of this magnificent event. It's not every weekend you get to have fun and learn with some of the world's brightest minds. I am very proud that I have created something that I can bring home with me and show my friends, family, and something strong that I can put on my resume. My proudest moment however was finally being able to get the smart phone's accelerator to work alongside the game.</p>\n<p>I learned quite a bit about game development and what goes on behind a good game. How important the \"juice\" is in making any game great. Besides a lot of computing and technical knowledge I learned a lot about myself too. I didn't think I had the dillegence and will power to carry through a whole project on my own and I proved myself wrong. I learned to trust myself and that at the next hackathon I go to, to try and find a team before so that I can create something far better and superior with more people.</p>\n<p>Balliver's Travels could be expanded into a full fledged game, it has beautiful tiled graphics and it's new features with the connectivity of the smart phones could be a strong selling point for it. However I believe I will retire it because once you finish a game the next one is not only easier to build, but bound to be better. Balliver's Travels will however have a prominent place on my resume.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ea-path-finder</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hml</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["FallingBob", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FallingBob \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/001/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FallingBob \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/002/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>FallingBob - A web game</h1>\n<p>Version 1.0<br/>\nCreated by: Kai Fang, Yunqi Wang, Dang Ying<br/>\nUniversity of Michigan     </p>\n<h6>#################################</h6>\n<p>If any problem occurs, try to visit this webpage to play the game!<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Efangkai/FallingBob/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www-personal.umich.edu/~fangkai/FallingBob/index.html</a> </p>\n<h6>#################################</h6>\n<p>Keys:<br/>\nZ: Mute/Unmute<br/>\nX: Pause/Resume<br/>\nSpace: Hop<br/>\n\u2191\u2193\u2190\u2192: Control Directions     </p>\n<h6>#################################</h6>\n<p>Sponge Bob had a wild dream and he fell into a wonderland.<br/>\nIf you choose \"New Game\", you will enter a random wonderland.<br/>\nOtherwise, the wonderland/scene can be chosen if you go to \"Choose Theme\".     </p>\n<h6>#################################</h6>\n<p>What he needs to do right now is keep jumping and moving to avoid hitting the roof or falling to the bottom.<br/>\nHe also has to keep his health above 0 to survive.<br/>\nHe can jump from platform to platform to prevent him from falling to the bottom and hitting the roof.     </p>\n<h6>#################################</h6>\n<p>There is a regular platform that has no effect.<br/>\nThere is a bouncing platform where Sponge Bob gets a boost up whenever he touches it.<br/>\nThere is a rolling platform that has no special effect but moving in a certain horizontal range.<br/>\nThere is a roving platform that can moves Sponge Bob to the right side.<br/>\nThere is a transient platform that if Bob stands on it long enough, it will disappear and Sponge Bob will fall down.<br/>\nThere is a invisible platform that only if Bob falls onto it will it appear.<br/>\nThere is a dangerous platform where Bob will keep losing health when Bobs stands on those platforms.<br/>\nHowever, if Bob stands on other platforms, Bob can regain health.     </p>\n<h6>#################################</h6>\n<p>Bob's health is shown at the upper middle.<br/>\nThe current score is at the upper left.

While this is currently not a feature in iOS 8 and iOS 9, it provided the discussion to understanding future capabilities of messaging platforms, especially since text messaging technology hasn't changed much since MMS was introduced. The team found the challenge to be exciting, and we attempted to develop it. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The application allows for users to connect with other services using a messaging interface, specially for the iOS model. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This was built using various Cocoapod frameworks for UI and web handing, along with Swift, and Xcode. Initially, we created a design of the app with Sketch, and worked from there. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we faced with creating the API's for sending responses to the user. Troubleshooting the bugs were proved to be increasingly difficult as time went on. With the help of some mentors and research, we were able to reduce the number of bugs in our program. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of being able to integrate this concept into iOS. The opportunities allow for other apps and businesses to take advantage of this \"MessageKit\" platform to better connect with users outside of their application. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that with proper planning and realistic sketches, we can tackle complex issues when we understand the resources that are at our disposal. There were times that we felt that the scope was too large with the time restrictions of the hackathon, but we were able to develop most of the functionality. We also learned different types of custom UI capabilities, particularly with custom buttons to interact with web content. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Servis</h2>\n<p>Servis wants to expand to adopt multiple application, including transportation, restaurants, and lifestyle applications. We also want to serve both the phone and tablet platforms with this software, after doing some research on user habits and needs. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/jacobanks/Intrigue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/jacobanks/Intrigue\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the iOS application, and some of the PHP backend as well, this being my first time in a while I had worked with Laravel, and my first overall with PubNub.", "I did most of the backend, which used Laravel's Lumen component and Pusher, among other things.", "", ""]], ["Pigment Incubator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pigment Incubator \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/947/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Inspired by the greatest artists!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a platform that allows artists to show off and sell their works, get donations, win badges, communicate, comment on other works, browse art-related news, participate in monthly challenges, etc.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the CO domain and the Capital One API!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Too much work to do within 36 hours</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pigment Incubator</h2>\n<p>We plan to improve the current website and finish all the functions that we have planned but did not finish this time, e.g. art fair (for people to trade their works), monthly art challenges, etc.\nand found a startup!!!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/backbone-js\">backbone.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">requirejs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/underscorejs\">underscorejs</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pigmentincubator.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pigmentincubator.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pigmentincubator.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["TWO3D (ROScloud)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We read about ORB-SLAM, a in a computer vision research paper earlier this year.

Similarly, we used Linode, Flask, and websockets to implement a backend that would let users collaborate on a single set of OBJ/MTL files simultaneously but reduced our focus on that since just being able to make OBJ files with your bare hands was something that mattered the most.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>We associated LEAP Motion-recognized gestures (like picking up an object, rotating an object, pointing at something, etc.) with modifications to the OBJ file using three.JS  and Python/Flask. Our goal was to let people- of all technical and non-technical backgrounds- to just build and print objects without having to learn how to work with CAD software.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The JavaScript OBJ libraries aren't very oriented toward live modification, so we set up a janky solution using Python to modify a file instead of mostly just being able to load it.</p>\n<h2>Status</h2>\n<p>As of MHacks' end-time, makerSpark has a limited set of gestures associated with OBJ modifications.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>We plan on integrating collaboration and Oculus at some point and (more importantly) significantly expanding the gesture recognition library now that we don't have to dedicate most of our time to figuring out Leap.js. The endgame is an intuitive, collaborative platform for designing 3-D printable files- we want this to be usable by 8-year-olds.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rajatmehndiratta/CollabCAD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rajatmehndiratta/CollabCAD\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["TaskMaster", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMaster \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/833/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMaster \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/834/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMaster \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/835/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMaster \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/836/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMaster \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/837/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TaskMaster \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/874/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We've all been in high-stress situations - be it the organization of a large event, a large move, or anything involving a lot of logistics and a lot of people - where communication could be a lot better. New tasks always pop up in the most unexpected of times, and many of these aren't properly tracked, delegated or sometimes even carried out. This is the problem TaskMaster hopes to resolve.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's an iOS app that allows event organizers to delegate tasks effectively. First, an event organizer creates an event in the app, and all other organizers/voluteers/helpers subscribe to it. Beyond that point, anyone in the event can add new tasks to the event that need to be done (eg. of how a typical task might look like - \"bring chairs from storage room to auditorium\"), and those tasks will be automatically assigned to the person best suited for them. The main board is updated in real time too, with a notification sent to every new assignee.</p>\n<p>Factors for picking the best person for a task include location/proximity to the places mentioned in the task, availability of that person, and the number of tasks they've done up to this point. The goal is to maximize efficiency and to reduce communication barriers in hectic situations like event organization.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The iOS app is written entirely in Swift, and uses Firebase as the main backend data store. Natural language processing (to determine locations as well as basic intents of tasks) is handled by Wit.ai. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Since there's no custom backend code, many tasks that would have been better handled in a proper backend like task delegation and notifications were instead handled in the frontend, which increased the amount of data requests made to Firebase. The code was also less clean, but overall we didn't face any showstoppers on this front.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to get bluetooth iBeacon integration working, which was pretty cool. Having beacons representing areas/rooms makes it easier for the app to target incoming tasks to people close to the areas/rooms mentioned in those tasks.</p>\n<p>We were able to grasp the JSON-like structure of Firebase pretty well right away, and exploit that well for our use case. Overall, we felt like we went from zero to a well-functioning Swift app very quickly. We were also proud that we were able to bring a bit of natural language processing into the fold to make the task matching process a lot smarter.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We all improved on our proficiency of Swift, and learned a lot about real-time syncing and denormalized (i.e. with duplicates) data storage. We were all beginner-to-intermediate iOS developers going into this hack, and now we feel more confident about our skills than we originally did.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TaskMaster</h2>\n<p>We'd like to make the user experience even easier to use - with voice dictation to fully take advantage of natural language processing. This would eliminate a lot of clicks, and would greatly increase TaskMaster's utility. Other improvements could revolve around fine-tuning the task matching algorithm to also take into account the type of task rather than just their location - and arrive at a decision based on the kinds of tasks each individual might prefer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aniketk1/TaskMaster\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/aniketk1/TaskMaster\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Token", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Token \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/846/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Token \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/847/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Token \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/848/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Token \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/849/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I observed that our younger generations are learning to use technology at such young ages.

The admins reward the children by giving tokens which students can then use to customize their very own profile pages! Students can redeem tokens for stickers, page customization, and even gifts for other students.

Integration into Gear VR and use of the smartphone to provide an AR experience for real life environments lie not far in the future. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/notepad\">notepad++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">drive-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["itsontheway", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"itsontheway \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/771/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>itsontheway</h1>\n<p>Small web app that interfaces with the Google Maps and Yelp APIs to finding restaurants that are \"on the way\" between two locations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://itsontheway.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://itsontheway.azurewebsites.net/</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://itsontheway.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://itsontheway.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>itsontheway.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Taggr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The game watchdogs has a feature where the main character can see information about those around him, and we wanted to bring that into the real world in a meaningful way.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A user wearing google glass, equipped with our app, can find out information about the person in front of them. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The backend written in node and deployed on azure connects with the facebook graph api and scrapes facebook for data after facially recognizing a picture sent from google glass.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Taggr</h2>\n<p>The possibilities for Taggr are endless.

No mess. Just music.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app, simple in nature but sleek in design, is made for performance. W\nremoved the clutter that most music apps have. Instead of opting for a full set\nof piano keys, or a guitar neck, our app instead has just five buttons. But\ndon't be deceived\u2014with just those buttons, one can play twenty-four different\nnotes, or two full octaves!</p>\n<p>On the right side of the app, there are three buttons that can be used to play a\nscale. On the left side of the screen, there are two more buttons \u2014 one for\nsharps, and the other for flats. By tilting the phone forward, one plays higher\nmusical notes. And by shaking the phone, a user produces vibrato.</p>\n<p>We think our app is not only functional, but fun to use as well. But don\u2019t just\ntake our word for it, give it a twist!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Starting from a clean Xcode slate, our instrument manifested itself in the form\nof an iOS app. Making use of an open-source framework called AudioKit, we were\nable to get the audio synthesis up and running quickly and focus on the\ninstrument itself. SpriteKit allowed our visual palette to be as free as our\nsound palette, and CoreMotion gave us access to the device's motion for features\nthat would be otherwise impossible on physical instruments.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Twyst</h2>\n<p>We believe in the potential for mobile instrument applications. Not only ones\nthat are cute in the short term, but really ones that can reach the professional\nlevel. Twyst was a preliminary experiment in how we can get mobile music apps to\nthe level that they might perform in front of audiences, and even shape the\nfuture of the music industry.</p>\n<p>When showing Twyst to other hackers, we found that users of all skill levels\nloved tilting and shaking the phone. This led to the following conclusion:\nproducing music through applications is not simply about touch interfaces. It\u2019s\nreally about the gamut of tools that phones offer! Hopefully we can continue\nthis in future iterations.</p>\n<p>Thank you for trying Twyst, and we can\u2019t wait to see how you\u2019ll push it to the\nnext level.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sprite-kit\">sprite-kit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">audiokit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">coremotion</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aclissold/twyst\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/aclissold/twyst\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped out on all facets of the app\u2014from audio synthesis to visual design to accelerometer logic\u2014with my expertise in iOS/Swift.", "I worked on the frontend, including the design of the logo, layout of the app, and certain elements of how the sound was performed!"]], ["Vania Virtual Evolution Thru Natural Selection", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLTlutu_2u4?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vania Virtual Evolution Thru Natural Selection \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/764/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vania Virtual Evolution Thru Natural Selection \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/767/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vania Virtual Evolution Thru Natural Selection \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/803/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I have always thought the concept of a computer simulating evolution</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using fitness, genomes, and species it's spam random strains of commands to eventually beat Castlevania levels</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built it using Hex Editors to tracks ROM data.

The server then checks the nfc ID with the database of food items, then puts that item in the user's inventory.  The server delivers the webpage which displays the user's inventory and shopping list.  The server tracks the user's use of an item and moves it to the shopping list once it has been used up.  Here we utilized the Wal Mart API to show the user the exact product they purchased previously and even display current prices where available.\nWe also included an option to add friends on the webpage, if accepted, the user can blast text requests (using twilio) for specific grocery items which the server will only send out to other friends who have that item in their inventory.  While at the store, the user can send a text to the server which will send a text response with their shopping list.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The big challenges we ran into were with setting up our .co domain, restrictions on the number of uses for the Wal Mart API, completing all of the features we wanted to within the time limit</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting everything done that we set out to do.

This create my idea of playing musical notes in response to compilation error amounts. I personally found it would be funny in the case that the compilation error amount just continues to grow, as it does sometimes when you try to fix code. While this project isn't exactly a visual project, I still wanted to do it since I found it entertaining, fun, and interesting.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user starts the script by notifying the program of which files to check on to see if they have compilation errors. If the specified code does have compilation errors, the program records the amount of errors that run of the compiler created. As the user continues compiling and recompiling, the compilation error amount will most likely change. When the user wants the program to stop recording, they enter \"DONE\", which will stop the program, but not before play musical notes that correspond to how many compilation errors were found throughout the commands. The lower the tone, the more compilation errors there were. This way, the change in amount of errors there were is played and shown in a musical way.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I just created a PHP script that calls command line commands in the place of the terminal and writes the error amounts to a file. At the en, the file is read and each error amount relates to an element in an array of musical files.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I ran into the problem of needing to be able to use the terminal to edit files that had compilation errors and letting the program use the terminal to take in user compilation commands.</p>\n<p>The main problem was caused by the fact that I couldn't use the terminal normally since the terminal was reading in the compilation commands and outputting them. Because of the program's use of the terminal, vim, the default text editor I use, couldn't be used. I solved the second problem by just using another terminal.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of this project since this is the first program I had written at a hackathon and its the first time I've programmed with audio files since high school.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I refreshed my memory of PHP and learned the command needed to play audio files.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Musical Errors</h2>\n<p>Musical Errors could expand to have a website as the main user interface. This would fix the problem of needing multiple terminals/windows to edit the code and would be more user friendly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["JobHacks", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobHacks \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/567/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobHacks \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/681/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We developed a responsive Ruby on Rails application for any job seekers out there (especially college students!) who want to have a repository of all their company interests and job applications. </p>\n<p>We used the LinkedIn API so users can easily register on JobHacks with their LinkedIn profile information.

Our inspiration comes from the need to contact people faster.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h3>Sends Texts to Multiple People</h3>\n<p>First, user authentication is used to create personal accounts; this will establish a personal database on our Firebase. The interface will have three categories: drunk, danger, and lost. In the right bottom corner, the interface will let the users edit their contact list for the categories. Press submit to add the contact to the database. Press clear after selecting a list to clear <strong>all</strong> contacts of that list. Back to the main page, if you select one of the categories, you will be able to access the button, \"Send Text.\" Send Text will send a text message via the user's phone, requesting assistance through the text app to the designated contacts.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h3> Using FireBase as Central Database </h3>\n<p>We were able to use FireBase as our central database where we store our contact information. We have three characteristics that make each instance unique: name, number, and category. Getters and setters were implemented for easy access. User authentication was also controlled at the side of the FireBase.</p>\n<h3> Android API for sending texts </h3>\n<p>We accessed the Android API to send a help text from the user's phone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h3> Lack of Mobile Signal in the building </h3>\n<p>The lack of mobile signal prevented us from communicating between devices through text.</p>\n<h3> First Time Hackathoners + First time Android programming </h3>\n<p>Lack of experience gave us a very hard time in terms of syntax and layouts.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h3> Able to program an Android App </h3>\n<p>Our team was formed with 3 first-time hackers and an experienced hacker. However, it was our first time hacking with an Android. We are very proud that we were able to produce an app that we could use (not necessarily the most beautiful or convenient in the UI/UX but functional)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h3> Yoon </h3>\n<p>I learned that even though it might be your first time hacking, but with determination, using available support, and a lot of energy drinks, you can make something useful and substantial. I also learned that the ideas that people may think that is \"simple\" isn't necessarily simple to code. But also, simple ideas can be the ideas that could catch on to the public. I was also able to confirm that if I am able to put my 100% into the idea, we can make it happen.</p>\n<h3> Qais </h3>\n<p>I learned how to make an android app with a group of coders - in particular, I learned how to use github.</p>\n<h3> Miao Zi </h3>\n<p>This is the first time I developed an Android app. I learned to step out of my comfort zone and try something new. Besides, I also learned on how to decide when to build things from scratch or just use an existing API to achieve the same task.</p>\n<h3> Morgan </h3>\n<p>This was my first hackathon and first time making an Android app, let alone an app itself. I've learn so much about coding and the creative and innovative nature that surrounds it. To be part of a group of builders has been such an amazing experience and has only encouraged me to attend more hackathons.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GroupMyContacts</h2>\n<p>For next steps, we first intend to make the UI/UX much more sleek and designed. We also also looking into implementing Google API for location tracking of the user and Uber API so the friend can call the Uber for the user. We are also looking into allowing the users to customize the lists and the message sent. We are also looking into making the editing option for the contact more flexible. Overall, we plan to make the app not only exclusive to emergency situations but as an easy way to send out group messages. We are also looking into implementing an app-to-app chat, allowing communication to be easier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kiyoonko/GroupMyContacts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kiyoonko/GroupMyContacts\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Express Me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/296/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/652/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Express Me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/651/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Expression is through more than just words.

Hence, we chose the HTML5/CSS/Javascript stack to work the frontend and PHP as the backend, with calls to python for natural language processing through the famous NLTK library.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make the process of booking and/or getting things for users more easy and intuitive, but could not get to an acceptable level of doing so, since the payment services require 3rd party formal tie ups with companies. We also wanted to incorporate the Uber API for seamless integration of cab booking, but could not do so. Also, for our idea to actually reach full potential, we look forward to a long time development process.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Integration of voice to text for more intuitive user experience. Exclusive design of the website. Near reach of the initial purpose of the project.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to better work with API's. Manage project ideas.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Genie: 'Im'personal Digital Assistant</h2>\n<p>Removal of the purchase steps for better user experience with major of the services/products. A way to combine online and offline modules for a better integration of IoT.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phpmyadmin\">phpmyadmin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">voice-to-text</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webspeech-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">serialcommunication</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://genie-sidshah.rhcloud.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://genie-sidshah.rhcloud.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>genie-sidshah.rhcloud.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I WORKED ON INTEGRATING VARIOUS APIS FOR THIS PROJECT", "I worked on the front end and natural language processing and the IoT integration of the project"]], ["FacePass", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FacePass \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/675/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FacePass \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/405/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FacePass \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/402/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FacePass \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/403/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FacePass \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/649/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>FacePass: The World's Easiest Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n<p>Tired of typing out lengthy passwords on a phone screen, waiting on texts with authorization codes, and always having to keep your token generator on hand?</p>\n<p>Introducing <strong>FacePass</strong>, which makes keeping your data secure as fun as taking a selfie!</p>\n<p>Unlike current two-factor authentication methods, <strong>FacePass</strong> relies on the combination of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An <em>inherence factor</em>, in the form of facial recognition technologies to provide biometric identity verification, in addition to</li>\n<li>A <em>knowledge factor</em>, in the form of a unique password comprised of selecting a facial feature known only to the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We utilize state-of-the-art cloud-based face algorithms from Microsoft's <a href=\"https://www.projectoxford.ai/face\" rel=\"nofollow\">Project Oxford</a> to detect and recognize a human face from an image taken on your iPhone.</p>\n<p>We also store a photo-based password based on a user's tap on a location relative to their face (e.g. left eye, nose, center of mouth).

We feel it is a great tool for not only gaining revenue but also expanding your knowledge of the financial and economical world. Like many others we aren't stock market pros. So instead of making wrong choices about which stock to buy, why not have an app to tell you? \nSentiStock takes rss feeds from popular blogs and websites and through sentimental analysis gives you advice on whether you should buy more stock, sell your current shares, or keep your shares. \nTo build this application we used swift, json, xml parser, and sentimental analysis. As previously stated we took rss feeds from popular websites and blogs. Our api for sentimental analysis was able to pull relevant keywords and phrases from the rss feeds to determine whether the article was positive, negative, or neutral. Based on this we were able to theorize whether the companies stock was going to go up or down. \nIntegrating the sentimental analysis and having it work with the rss feeds was a big challenge for us since we had never done this before, but after hours upon hours of research and hard work we were able to make it work.\nSince getting the sentimental analysis to work was such a challenge and a pain it is easily our proudest accomplishment in accordance with this application. \nThrough developing this application we learned that learning and understanding new languages, api's, and software is much harder than we originally thought. It takes many hours of handwork, studying, building, and of course plenty of red bull. \nIn the future we hope to get SentiStock in the app store so it can help users world wide make better stock decisions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sentiment-analysis-online\">sentiment-analysis-online</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mitchmalinin/SentiStock\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mitchmalinin/SentiStock\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["whatDo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"whatDo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/627/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>(see pic gallery)\nwe have pretty boring breaks in our daily lives.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>it turns your breaks into interesting, close-by adventures!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>we put your google calendar events into google maps to find your daily route, and we used google places to find good places to eat and to spend your breaks at!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>lol. android hates us. webapps love us.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>we had a newbie on our team &amp; he learned a lot!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>how much asynchronous loading sucks</p>\n<h2>What's next for whatDoWeb</h2>\n<p>daily planner? find weather? find what mode of transportation is best?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-calendar\">google-calendar</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/angelaqiu/whatDoWeb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/angelaqiu/whatDoWeb\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Mosaic Ninja", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mosaic Ninja \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/529/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mosaic Ninja \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/800/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>MosaicNinja</h1>\n<p>Ever wanted to make something cool?

Electronic music often lacks the emotional human feel of traditional instruments.  My goal of this project was to build a controller for my music so that I can truly feel what I'm playing and interact with it in new ways.  This should result in a more human sounding, emotional relatable, way to play electronic music.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Shadow Box is a native MIDI device which means it requires no drivers.  MIDI is musical instrument digital interface (think USB but for music) so it runs on everything.  </p>\n<p>The box has a variety inputs that it converts into pure and simple MIDI data that any music software and read in and assign to knobs, faders, etc..., within the software.  There are plenty of simple MIDI controllers with loads of buttons and knob but I wanted something more.  </p>\n<p>On Shadow Box there is a unique set of inputs: <strong>Light Sensors</strong></p>\n<p>By hovering your hand over these sensors you cast your shadow onto them, changing their input.  Once you find a value you like you can then hold it at that value using other switches.</p>\n<p>Along with these new sensors are the some expected standards like 4 buttons (I used arcade buttons because they're sweet) and 4 regular twist knobs.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The core of the box is a more powerful Arduino like micro controller with ARM's Mbed programmed in C++.  A little bit of solder, one bad burn, and 75 compiles later, we have a MIDI controller.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Scaling the inputs so that they average smoothly while also being fast enough for real time music control was the biggest challenge.  You need to be able to turn a software knob slowly and accurately using the light sensor hardware, which I got working thanks to the awesome guys at the ARM booth, especially Brian Daniels.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It WORKS!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learn SO much.  This was my first ever hardware hack, first time really using a micro controller,  first time soldering a full project, first useful program in C++.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Shadow Box MIDI Controller</h2>\n<p>Swapping out the prototyping cardboard box for a nice wood and metal enclose, making it cheaper and more stable, and releasing the plans for open source musicians everywhere.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mbed</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Kannek", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kannek \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/295/970/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to create something actually useful in our day to day lives.

So what's a fun way to do this?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Tamagotchi game of old was loved by many. It taught kids to take care of a virtual pet, feeding it, walking it, playing with it and, most importantly, making sure it doesn't die. It is a classic among the early children's games. The Tamagotchi Survival Game revamps this fun idea by combining the physical and virtual world, adding to the factors that affect your pet/plant as it tries to survive and grow from a seedling to a towering tree... or other smaller plant haha. The plant can be tracked online through a web app, where players can keep a careful, nurturing eye on their delicate plants. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>The core technology that our project is built on is the Intel Edison and the sensors that come from the Grove starter kit. We utilize the sensors to track lighting data, temperature data, motion data, touch data, and displays the health and activity through an LCD display and three LEDs.  The other crucial technology that we wanted to integrate with is At&amp;t's M2X Internet of Things platform. This provides API's to both push to and pull from a database that stores all this interesting data. The last part would be to display the Tamagotchi in a fun way, through a web app on the browser. All in all, it challenged us to experiment with and learn a diverse set of skills and touched on many technologies, including C++, Hardware, Javascript, the Intel Edison, and M2X. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>The Intel Edison is still relatively new and is going through many iterations quickly. The board is not very forgiving to mistakes. The first night, I connected the sensors and got it connected to wifi. I felt confident because I had made a good amount of headway and I could take a nap. When I woke up, I discovered that I had forgot to log off correctly from the SSH connection with the board. This caused me to not be able to log on for the rest of the day and reset the wifi. Without the wifi connection, the chances of connecting to the IoT platform was low so I spent most of a day working on reflashing the board or trying to find a work around. This was very frustrating and swallowed up a huge amount of time. There were neither any Intel or technical At&amp;t staff present to help with these issues so it was hard trudging on.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even though a lot of time was wasted, I'm proud that we didn't give up and, at least, put something together in the end.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was my first time at MHacks so it was awesome seeing the culture at one of the oldest college hackathons in the country. I really enjoyed meeting people and taking part in the culture. In terms of technical skills, I learned more about the Intel Edison interface (it is changing rapidly) and At&amp;t's IoT platform, M2X. We were also able to hone our skills and learn more Javascript. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Tamagotchi Survival</h2>\n<p>As Intel's resources for the Edison continue to improve, we will no doubt be able to make improvements to our game and the way players can interact with their pets. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["The Last Taco", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Last Taco \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/753/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Last Taco \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/768/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Last Taco \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/769/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>The year is 3030, also known as 110 years after the passing of the last survivor of the zombie apocalypse, 30 years after the zombie horde evolved their diet from human flesh to Hard Shell 100% Pure Beef Tacos and the year where you the last surviving taco take your last stand. Will you be soft-shelled and let yourself be eaten or will you stand your ground and not let your taco friends be eaten in vain. The choice is yours.</p>\n<h2>Technologies Incorporated</h2>\n<ul>\n<li> Oculus Rift </li>\n<li> Electronic Arts API </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Objectives of the game and its players</h2>\n<p>The Last Taco is a game simulation for two or more players. One player operates the Oculus Rift and is referred to as the defender. As the name describes, the defender's objective is to maintain his or her survival from the simulated zombies.Those who are not the defender are referred to as the attacker(s) and they may log into our web app and are provided a birds-eye view of the defender's environment through the Oculus Rift. From there, the attacker(s) may deploy the simulated zombies that the defender sees at locations per their choosing. This game encourages attacker(s) to optimize strategy and teamwork to overwhelm the defender. As such, it forces the defender to be persistant and to exercise his or her sharp reflexes. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The players that are known as the attackers operate a Javascript and HTML 5 &amp; CSS encoded web app while the defender utilizes graphics and movements that are displayed through the Oculus Rift with C# coding and details from Unity. Sending data back and forth from the defender and the attacker(s) takes advantage of Electronic Art's API and is the backbone of our player to player interaction system. </p>\n<h2>Challenges that we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the primary challenges that we faced was matching the location of where the zombies will be stationed on the attacker'(s) devices with the general area of deployment on the defender's Oculus Rift. Another challenge that had equal or greater priority was matching the direction and path of the zombies on the Oculus Rift with the icons that represented the zombies on the attacker'(s) devices. Overall, a great majority of our challenges came from establishing relationship between the device(s) of the attacker(s) and the Oculus Rift of the defender. Challenges outside the boundaries of device communication involved the decision on whether to incorporate the Myo into our project. We ran several tests with the Myo, however, despite it being an unique addition to the game we concluded that the movements that the player would make would not be comfortable and may be harmful after long exposure and periodic sensitivity of the Myo would cause frustration.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are fond of</h2>\n<p>We are very content with our access to a variety of APIs and hardwares and how we incorporated a variety of these into our game. Our fondness towards this project also regards how we were able to exercise teamwork and communication despite us being strangers at the start of this challenge. Further accomplishments also include on how we are quite satisfied with the skills and knowledge that we gained throughout this journey in game development and the brief yet strong taste of sharing our project to others. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The knowledge and skills that we gained through our participation is quite bountiful, however, one of the more important gains that we took away from this project was that, games like ours and all other experiences regarding game development is so focused on iteration that it forced us to be selfless, to the best of our abilities incorporate all feedback and suggestions, and to be audience orientated.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ea-pathfinder</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://TheLastTa.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://TheLastTa.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>TheLastTa.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on making the Rift work, along with some other tasks", "", "", ""]], ["Meals for Deals", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meals for Deals \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/328/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meals for Deals \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/326/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meals for Deals \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/325/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>\"Save money, live better!\" <strong>Everyone buys groceries.</strong>The team takes more trips to Walmart than any other retailer in the world for our day-to-day needs, including home appliances, entertainment, stationary, and more recently... groceries!

The answer is, they can't. The five most popular passwords in 2014, according to a SplashData report, were \"123456\", \"password\", \"12345\", \"12345678\" and \"qwerty\". Oh my.</p>\n<p>But what if we didn't need to remember our complicated passwords? What if our access to our most precious things was by a secret handshake? I'm sure you all have that best friend or two or five, and a best friendship isn't complete without a secret handshake. You wouldn't dare forget this handshake, lest jeopardize your friendship. We imagine a future where your connection with your online accounts, banks, and secure physical locations is just as fun and easy to use as a secret handshake with your best friend.</p>\n<h1>Prototype</h1>\n<p>This prototype of Secret Handshake is available as a web application, and requires a Myo Armband and the Myo Connect application to be installed on your computer. When you browse to the app, you can either calibrate a handshake of your own, or attempt to authenticate a saved handshake. Your saved handshakes are stored in the cloud and accessible from anywhere.</p>\n<h1>Our journey to Secret Handshake</h1>\n<p>When we set out to create a Myo Armband based authentication system, we originally thought that the electrical signals from your muscles would be as unique as your fingerprints. That is, although everyone can make a fist, the specific signals read from your arm would be different than anybody else making a fist. This assumption turned out to be false. Human muscles are, in fact, very similar across many people, and it's relatively easy to mimic someone else's electrical signals just by thinking about how strongly you're flexing your muscles. Rather than give up, we combined the easy-to-use nature of the Myo Armband with traditional social values (handshakes!) to create a twist on the classic password system. Users can create their own custom sequences of muscle movements, so although the movements themselves are not unique, the handshake the user creates is. We hope you enjoy shaking hands with your technology as much as we do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bbatliner.github.io/handshake\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bbatliner.github.io/handshake\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bbatliner.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bbatliner/secret-handshake\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bbatliner/secret-handshake\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I integrated the browser app with the Myo.js library.

A bug report has been filed.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I found a bug in Xcode! Woo :)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I really enjoy developing with Swift.\nProtocol extensions are fantastic for structuring code and adding new functionality. I ended up adding functionality to Parse, CLLocation, CLLocationManager, UIViewController, Swift Array, Swift Dictionary, MKMapView. \nThe Swift type system made the functional approach a great fit for some parts of the application.\nGists available here: <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kevinrandrup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/kevinrandrup</a></p>\n<h2>What's next for Shoot Safe</h2>\n<p>I will need to invest some more time to harden the syncing model and testing it in bad network conditions before I feel comfortable distributing it to users. Once I have done that, I will use TestFlight to deploy the app to a few users and iterate on their feedback. I eventually plan to develop an Android version and a Web app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I wrote all of the code."]], ["TdotExchange", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TdotExchange \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/289/497/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Mission</h2>\n<p>Coming to the Mhack as university students, our team wanted to create an accessible, time efficient and cost effective platform for all fellow students to get together and exchange used textbooks. </p>\n<p>TdotExchange is a simplistic yet powerful Android App that allows students to connect together across campus.

It <em>Googles</em> and then <strong>implements Stack Overflow</strong> answers for you in an incredibly convenient manner. This program can be used to turn <strong>pseudocode</strong> into a rough program in <strong>almost any language</strong>, as well as providing quick debugging assistance to caffeinated engineers.</p>\n<h2>Why would you want to do that</h2>\n<p>The oft-heard statement which insults the modern day coding struggle goes something like this: \"Programming a.k.a Googling Stack Overflow\". I realized \"Hey! That is most of what I do. That part of programming is so easy my computer could do it.\" So this is what I made. \nI believe that eventually editors will do much more of the debugging work, and hopefully will be capable of building an efficient program from pseudocode. This program is a first step.</p>\n<h2>What was temporally expensive?</h2>\n<p>The sublime plug-in API is very simple and easy to use, but has incredibly limited features. Thus in the future it is advantageous to switch to another GUI system, such as Qt - something I struggled to implement thus far in Sublime's strange plug-in environment.</p>\n<h2>Anything strange happen?</h2>\n<p>It's funny how meta this project got - about 8 hours in, when it got usable, I began successfully using the plug-in to edit the plug-in's own code. At 4 AM this brings with it some unneeded and lengthy philosophical trains of thought. </p>\n<h2>What is cool about this program?</h2>\n<p><em>Using a bit of programming intuition</em>, I can turn <strong>pseudocode</strong> into <strong>working code</strong> in <strong>almost any language</strong>!</p>\n<h2>What's next for GSO?</h2>\n<p>\u2022Variable recognition for more effective pseudocode conversion (by linking code segments)</p>\n<p>\u2022Integration for more editors</p>\n<p>\u2022Better GUI (I spent the bulk of my time trying to incorporate Qt, which is much needed over sublime's default two-button message boxes)</p>\n<p>\u2022We benefit from Google continuing to get better and Stack Overflow continuing to get more comprehensive!</p>\n<p>Here's more rms for your endless enjoyment: \n(<a href=\"https://rms.sexy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://rms.sexy/</a>)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stack-overflow\">stack-overflow</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pygoogle</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mdtmc/stackofpy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mdtmc/stackofpy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Zafu", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Zafu \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/507/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Zafu \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/508/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Society is starting to move towards mindfulness.

How do I visually intrigue people to inspire them that meditation is awesome?  People seem to think you need to be a buddhist / monk / zen master to meditate; that it requires clearing all thoughts... not at all!  The first step is simply clearing the mind. Point being, informing people at all different understandings of meditation is a challenge.  The audience is very diverse.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I think I found a very nice aesthetic to represent this movement.  I would describe the aesthetic as classic, modern, minimalist, earthy, clean, and visually authoritative.  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>f&amp;%! it ship it!\nI relearned that designing a page not only takes iteration, but also requires user testing to find the natural way people want to engage with the site.

My awkward class schedule taught me--rather painfully--the importance of finding \"local\" study spots within buildings. When a library is 15 minutes away, who wouldn't want to send the next 30 minutes before class at a quiet hallway just around the corner?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows users to upload study spots, and then stores it into the Parse data base. When users click Find, we go through the database and find study spots that are a mile near it.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using javascript and HTML, we built the basic framework. We also put in Google Maps API and Parse integration to make use of maps and storage.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team was entirely new to Parse and we took a long time trying to figure out the syntax. It was difficult to combine aspects of design with the scripting code, plus not everyone on our team was experienced with HTML.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We figured out Parse even when we couldn't find any mentors! We initially wanted to change our idea because we thought it was too hard, but we decided to push through together and finish.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Docs can be complex to read, but it's worth taking the time to learn how to. It's hard to build things in unfamiliar languages, but the situation forces you to respond quickly and do whatever you can to understand.</p>\n<h2>What's next for studyNow</h2>\n<p>Hopefully user profiles, limitation to university campuses, and a whole ton of user involvement to uncover every nook and cranny in the school suitable for studying!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://studyhere.parseapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://studyhere.parseapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>studyhere.parseapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/juitungrayakuo/mhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/juitungrayakuo/mhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["BaymaxBuddies", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOeURCK_bmc?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BaymaxBuddies \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/863/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BaymaxBuddies \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/864/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BaymaxBuddies \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/865/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BaymaxBuddies \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/866/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BaymaxBuddies \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/288/867/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>BaymaxBuddies</h1>\n<p>MHacks Fall 2015 Submission</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xively\">xively</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/harshita-gupta/BaymaxBuddies\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/harshita-gupta/BaymaxBuddies\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I set up communication between both baymaxes, and used Xively as the backend.
