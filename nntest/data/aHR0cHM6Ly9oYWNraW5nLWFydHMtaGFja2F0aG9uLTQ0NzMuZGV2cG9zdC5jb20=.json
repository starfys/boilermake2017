[["Jibo: The Understudy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>So many people grow up with social anxiety - and levels of anxiety can range from mildly annoying to crippling. We want to provide an experience that will allow a child to grow in their social confidence without pressuring them in ways that make them unduly uncomfortable. There are also people who would like to involve themselves in acting, but for whom that would be impossible. We want to make theater accessible to those people as well because the arts should always be available to everyone.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Jibo is an intelligent social robot that interacts with the user. In our specific use case, Jibo recites and practices the lines of a play. When Jibo is given a script, he can emote according to a programmed direction. This allows children to practice their lines, but also to be a director. The child and Jibo make a perfect theatrical pair. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Jibo was built using the jibo-sdk library. This SDK allows us to build different behaviors for our Jibo. We could then interact with the Jibo in our simulator. In addition to developing the behavior, we also wrote a python script to take plays and translate them into the necessary documents for Jibo to perform the play. We also explored the capabilities of Jibo to handle misspoken lines when the keywords are still present. Using Indico\u2019s Machine Learning API, we\u2019re able to figure out the keywords of a line. Using the keywords, Jibo can ensure the person knows the majority of the lines and users  can decide if Jibo should correctly misspoken lines or just proceed. For example, if the line is \u201cHello, how was last night?\u201d and the user says \u201cHello, how was your night?\u201d, Jibo would still recognize the line. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>While the Jibo SDK has many features, it proved to be much more difficult to work with than we had hoped. There were many bugs and a lot of places where the documentation was out-of-date. We spent much more of our time fighting with the Jibo SDK than hacking. While the Jibo engineers were great support, they were only here for the first few hours and debugging without them proved very difficult. Despite this, we were able to accomplish a hack we are very proud of. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to have built an app that can help bring theater to those who wouldn\u2019t necessarily have the option. By giving people a method to build their social confidence, we are attempting to increase quality of life. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>On our team, we had 5 first-time hackathon hackers and only one veteran hacker. This hackathon was an amazing blend of art and technology, and it was a great space to learn more about hackathons and the cycle of learning they promote. We loved the opportunity to explore a product from all sides of design, business, art and technology.\nAdditionally, we had the opportunity to learn about Jibo and its impressive capabilities. When simply interacting with robot, it is easy to miss all of its impressive capabilities. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Jibo: The Understudy</h2>\n<p>Given more time, there is a lot we\u2019d like to add to our project. Currently all of Jibo\u2019s emotions are hardcoded, which works well enough, but we\u2019d love to have Jibo analyze his lines and figure out what emotion to show. We\u2019ve started playing with this using the indico emotion analysis API, but there\u2019s still work to be done.\nNext, currently Jibo can only respond with the next line. While we have worked with Jibo handling incorrect lines, we haven\u2019t given Jibo the ability to correct the child when they\u2019re wrong.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jibo-sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indico</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">adobe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on Business model and set up initial environments.", "", ""]], ["pasithea", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/192558954?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0#t=\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pasithea \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/416/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pasithea \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/412/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Jibo SDK demo environment.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pasithea \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/495/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>CONCEPT + GOALS</h2>\n<p>We are trying to improve mental well-being by integrating therapeutic breathing training into JIBO. This program would be especially useful for people who are living on their own, and who might not be able to recognize their own symptoms which might lead to further mental disintegration if not recognized in time (such as mental exhaustion, depression, etc.).</p>\n<p>** The goal of this program is to identify stress symptoms that the own user might not be aware of, and to reduce the displays of these stress expressions, which in turn could reduce the person\u2019s anxiety. ** </p>\n<h2>AUDIENCE</h2>\n<p>Adults living alone, children, etc. JIBO is our tool of choice because it is easy to use for people who may not want to seek professional help, but who still need a resource + strategies to help against stress.</p>\n<h2>WHY JIBO?</h2>\n<p>We were interested in using JIBO because of its distinctive and approachable social personality. It also has Bluetooth capabilities, which would be used to connect to existing wireless pulse sensor devices, such as FitBit and the Smart Watch. </p>\n<p>Beyond what is already projected for [project name], JIBO has additional capabilities that leave lots of room for expansion. Its facial recognition functionality, for example, is particularly promising; in the future, it would be possible to program JIBO to recall which user has frequent high-stress levels and could be in need of reminders for meditation practices. </p>\n<p>Additionally, JIBO can keep files on the different family members and tailor its meditative practices to each specific user, which entails some interesting Machine Learning applications. </p>\n<h2>FUNCTIONALITY</h2>\n<p>Again, JIBO serves as a sympathetic companion to the user. The general interaction sequence is as follows: </p>\n<p>a. Initiates dialogue user based on indirect/direct cues</p>\n<p><strong>Indirect</strong>: input from external devices (heart rate from FitBit, Apple Watch) or Google Calendar/Mail (on particularly busy days), which are both possible with the commercial version of JIBO\nbiofeedback</p>\n<p><strong>Direct</strong>: user greeting Jibo directly</p>\n<p>b. After listening to the user\u2019s response, it gauges mood by sorting responses into one of three categories--<em>negative answer, positive answer/positive tone, and positive answer/negative tone</em>--and responds accordingly.</p>\n<p>If the user responses negatively (be it in the form of a negative answer or positive answer/negative tone), Jibo will offer to accompany user in one of a number of basic mindfulness exercises\nOffers a number of alternatives</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jibo-sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bengsquared/JiboBreatheEasy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bengsquared/JiboBreatheEasy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByOyTFKqQTl3YTRTc1dKZ096VFE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByOyTFKqQTl3YTRTc1dKZ096VFE\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/a/brown.edu/file/d/0ByOyTFKqQTl3OWI4VS1lTkVsWGs/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/a/brown.edu/file/d/0ByOyTFKqQTl3OWI4VS1lTkVsWGs/view?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["FusionMagic", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FusionMagic \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/201/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>robot arm -

We are a team of five artists and technologists who are inspired to use dance technology as a learning platform for future dancers. Collectively we are dance lovers, but understand the challenges that come with trying to learn and teach this kinetic art form. Tamer (MIT Sloan 2017), a novice dancer, shared his frustrations with trying to learn Lindy Hop this summer. Classes were large, instructors can be hard to follow, and the classes are not catered to the learning curve of each student. Arthur (MIT Sloan 2017), a ballroom dance teacher, can relate. As an instructor, he emphasizes the necessity of a supplementary feedback system-- both to increase confidence and improve dance abilities. Margaret\u2019s (MIT 2018) interest to prompt muscle memory through responsive feedback systems, and Linda\u2019s (Pratt 2018) background in architectural and industrial design contribute to the viability of this technology as a product that can be brought to the market. Natalie\u2019s (Tufts Alumni 2016) experience in dance and new media curation helps to identify potential users. With our joint skill sets we are confident we are presenting a product that can revolutionize the way we learn musicality and dance skills through physical digital responses and haptic feedback. We aim to push discouraged individuals back into dance classrooms, teach beginners the basics of movement, and deliver world-class instruction to all open-minded students. </p>\n<h3>What it does</h3>\n<p>Introducing, Figure 8 - an app + wearable solution to help dancers get better - almost like a personal dance instructor. The app contains the techniques and figures of a variety of dance styles. The companion to the app is a set of modular, wearable devices, which go on various parts of the body (Waist, Wrist, Torso, Ankle/Feet). These wearables are sync'ed to your app, and as you practice specific moves, these wearables capture your technique (position, motion, movement, etc), and provide gentle \"nudges\" via a variety of technologies (haptic, pneumatic tubes, mini-motors) to help guide your movement to being more correct</p>\n<h3>How we built it</h3>\n<p>We built a demo for the most basic dance skill - musicality. Musicality means the ability to identify the beat or tempo pattern in the music you are listening to, so that you can then time your movements to the music. To help train someone in this, we wanted to give the user a physical indicator for the tempo of a song they are listening to. This approach emulates how Arthur would teach musicality to his students-  by playing music and tapping them on the shoulder so they could associate the beat they are hearing with the tap they are feeling. To accomplish this, we created an iPhone app that leverages the built-in haptic engine to provide a physical cue to the user that aligns with the music they are listening to. This transforms auditory to physical, thereby helping the student learn how to identify the right beat, and stay on beat while practicing basic motions. </p>\n<h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>\n<p>One of the main challenges we ran into was whether or not our product would be a standalone product, or one that uses the existing framework of an iphone. We found that integrating it with an iphone was a powerful idea because it made Figure 8 more accessible to the public. However, we also decided that a standalone product could be the next phase.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to be integrating technology with dance pedagogy through a playful and professional application. We are including state-of-the-art technology. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that the user needs direct feedback from the product modules we create. Rather than being something that is simply instructive, the wearable modules needs to be devices that tell you, like an instructor would, whether or not you are doing the movements correctly. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Figure 8</h2>\n<p>After our initial prototype, we plan to continue developing our product \u201cmodules\u201d - modular wearables for different parts of the body: Wrist, Waist, Torso, Ankle. These modules will incorporate various types of sensors to input data, as well as various feedback technologies to provide feedback.</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mB7sXyqhgV7Wq0ZwNUi0mabUCINeNRN01ni_1XVDDXI/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mB7sXyqhgV7Wq0ZwNUi0mabUCINeNRN01ni_1XVDDXI/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B98K2Vz8nR5lUGN6TlBzUkJKZU0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B98K2Vz8nR5lUGN6TlBzUkJKZU0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B98K2Vz8nR5lb0tHcmx6Wk11VHM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B98K2Vz8nR5lb0tHcmx6Wk11VHM\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tdeif/Figure8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tdeif/Figure8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Virduoso", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Performance is enhanced with multiple people on stage.

The user inputs a keyword and a time frame, and gets a map of the world colored by the emotions of the people tweeting about it. The map is interactive; the user can zoom in on a certain area and click on the differently colored dots to see the tweets associated with them.

For a creator/or a storyteller it is often very difficult to come up with one, when provided with a blank canvas or an empty page to start with. The narrator needs hooks and metaphors to bind the audience and tell a unique story. </p>\n<p>There are a bunch of bots/AI tools out there which completely automates the process of the coming up with content. But there is no human involved in the creation process which totally removes the wonderful aspect of ideating, curating and personalizing something right from the beginning.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are tools which provide blank canvases and empty windows in the attempt to give all the freedom to the creator. Though such a control seemed exciting at first, it soon became a challenge for me and many of my creative friends to come up with ideas for telling a unique story.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>FlipFl.app nicely walks line between helping you with ideas/ giving you full freedom to create your own story. The app serves as a guide for the user by coming up with interesting interpretations to the \"premise\" the user begins with.\nHere are broad steps on how the app helps create an original story.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user inputs a keyword/ uploads an image / records a sound.</li>\n<li>Then the app creatively interprets the media and comes up with suggested keywords, homonyms, metaphors, palettes, images, sounds  and more premises.</li>\n<li>The user selects the images, sounds and themes that he is interested in</li>\n<li>Then the selected media would be arranged in a storyboard style for the creator.</li>\n<li>The user can then either make a story out them in their chosen final format or just use it as brainstorming / ideating tool to share it with collaborators and build upon the idea.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We designed the app on pencil and paper and mock-ed it up in Adobe XD. We also built few pages in HTML, CSS and Javascript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made a very good use case for the product and we are very proud of it. We started with the issue of immigration, then came up with metaphor of birds to address the issue of immigration. Then we studied how birds fly and made it as one of key concepts of our interactive story. Birds flight can be studied as as sine wave and sound at a very basic level is a sine wave. So we also added a sound part to our installation which affects how the birds fly and look.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Hacking leap motion. Using Adobe XD. User experience design. Creative coding. Creative brian storming. How to pull off a successful all nighter. </p>\n<h2>What's next for FlipFl.app</h2>\n<p>Make it a fully functional app and release it in the app store. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">adobe-xd</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/863e014f-4528-4fa2-8ad7-65e0eb23fcc4/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://xd.adobe.com/view/863e014f-4528-4fa2-8ad7-65e0eb23fcc4/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>xd.adobe.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Revive", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Tai Chi is a highly beneficial practice to both mental and physical well-being, but it is not widely adopted given lack of accessibility and the difficulties in learning both the moves and the concepts.

Ikea furniture is notoriously hard to build. This is an experience thats often associated with frustration. Now, imagine what it would be like to experience that with a total stranger - someone to help and bond with over that experience. We believe that emerging from a shared experience of struggle often unites people, and we'd like to build that experience for people in public spaces. We would like to spread love and bring ultimately bring people together with our furniture piece. </p>\n<p><strong>What it does</strong>\nThe furniture is intentionally annoying to construct and is physically built around the people who construct it. Only when at least two people work on it, it lights up and activates. The chair is designed to also literally bring people together - when two people are enclosed in this furniture, they must face each other in a constrained space, exaggerating this experience and forcing people to literally break down barriers and build something from them together. In this piece, the final result AND the process both help support the notion of bonding with our community.</p>\n<p><strong>How we built it</strong>\nWe would have preferred to fab this with a laser cutter or a cnc router and OSB, but for logistical reasons, we hand cut every piece from three large sheets of foam board.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenges we ran into</strong>\nManual labor and measurements! Logistically mapping shapes from 2D to 3D with a weaker material that can't actually sustain our weight makes it difficult to fully immerse ourselves in the project.</p>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments that we're proud of</strong>\nWe're so happy that we were able to finish this project over the night - we love how it turned out and really do believe that experiences like this can bring people together and help them bond over shared experiences that otherwise might not be available. This project is a performative art piece, a public furniture, a technology-integrated sculpture and a spectacle with social impact.</p>\n<p><strong>What's next for m\u00f6bel</strong>\nM\u00f6bel wants to be more integrated in tech and have many additional capacitive sensors so the furniture knows its progress as its being constructed. We would like to rebuild this in OSB for sustainability and support, and plant it in public pavillions like bus stops where strangers often meet. We can also imagine this being used in team-building applications for companies, where instead of putting people into pretend situations, they can emerge from the experience productively building a real furniture piece.</p>\n<p>We'd really like to thank Hacking Arts for hosting, mentors for their wonderful feedback and guidance and Josh Vekhter for supplying us with a Whoa Board and being incredibly helpful throughout! It's been really awesome meeting people with such diverse backgrounds and experiences and we really wanted to make something that represented that.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">whoa-board</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cardboard</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sharpie</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">care</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Webo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TEBD9qVcGJE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Webo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/424/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Happy Webo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Webo \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/390/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Design process-1</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Webo \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/393/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Design process-2</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Webo \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/395/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Design process-3</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Webo \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/388/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Team Webo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We started with an interest in robots that behave as more than just functional boxes--robots that experience and exhibit empathy. With a gravitation toward Jibo's mission statement of \"helping the user with a robot that has personality\", we leveraged Jibo's hardware and SDK to push the boundaries of human-robotic communication through natural language. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Webo detects movement and facial expression with Microsoft Emotion API. We look at the adjective which has the highest occurrence and match it to happy, sad, or neutral. After the pattern matching, Webo will reply in tune with natural human conversation. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We worked with the Jibo SDK to expand upon its current set of demo packages by implementing Microsoft Cognitive Services' Emotion API. In enhancing the perception capability of Jibo's camera output, we were able to provide sentiment analysis on facial recognition and make the robot more socially aware in home conversational settings.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Jibo SDK is still in beta; thus, it exhibits various unresolved bugs and methods without sample code, which took us a lot of time to work through small problems. Even more challenging, we were not able to test our product with an actual hardware unit. Furthermore, we had limited interactions with Jibo engineers who could otherwise point us to the correct implementation directions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We implemented Microsoft's Emotion API successfully, and through its collected dataset, have improved Jibo's sense of empathy. By putting human experience first, we were able to take a step toward redesigning the subservient nature of current human-computer communications.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Technically, we learned to create within the Jibo SDK through its documentation and API references. At a more fundamental level, we came to understand that what human-computer interactions require in order to move forward are primarily design improvements in human experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Webo</h2>\n<p>We plan to develop more modes of personal robot language that empathize with human experience. By engaging robots and humans in more consistent regular conversation, we plan to define a new set of capabilities for a computer co-inhabited world.</p>\n<p>The original Github link is private because it contains Microsoft API: <a href=\"https://github.com/chrisMYchen/weboInMotion\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/chrisMYchen/weboInMotion</a>\n[UPDATE]A new link is posted.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">atom</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jibo</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chrisMYchen/weboEmotionPublic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chrisMYchen/weboEmotionPublic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["About Face", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylSyJbdI7Uw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"About Face \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/489/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>3D Model of the exhibit space made with Fusion 360</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"About Face \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/491/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample image of FaceSwap technology</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"About Face \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/492/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample image of FaceSwap technology</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"About Face \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/493/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample image of FaceSwap technology</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"About Face \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/494/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Series of images that capture participant's changing emotions during the video</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"About Face \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/513/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Series of images that capture participant's changing emotions during the video</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"About Face \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/449/004/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Awesome About Face team members! :)</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Now more than ever, we live in a country divided. We can\u2019t understand our neighbors, and we cling to those who reflect our views. We\u2019ve forget to allow ourselves to understand the feelings of others, and in forgetting how to empathize we are expediting the path of hate, we all fear. Our project sets out to tackle empathy, instead of the default that we tend to fall into, where we look at controversial topics from only our point of view. We want to help others in this time of isolation learn that we all have experiences that shape our stories, and that the stories of others can shape us. We were able to tackle this problem, because Morris had previously created a face swap technology for commercial use. He had a vision that this technology could be art and could make people feel. With this idea central to our hearts we were able to extend to a place of greater understanding. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The demo of our product is a video that has automatically face swapped the actor's face into a predetermined story. We ask the actor to allow us to take a series of photos, which are then set in a progressive story line to allow the view of a different perspective. Lastly, we take the actors pictures as they watch the video, and at the end, the pictures are reflected back onto the actor, confronting them with a literal \u201cin your face\u201d representation of how they felt. A crucial element of this piece, is that the narrative isn\u2019t the point. We could easily have put the actor's face on someone facing domestic violence, someone facing deportation, or someone in a war zone. We choose to address the domestic epidemic of homelessness, because we wanted a clear cut story that everyone, here today, can relate to. We all see homeless people in our daily lives and many of us don\u2019t even think twice. We hope our piece will ask you to think again, and examine these people as people and not inconveniences, or sob stories, or something to be avoided.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The program is based off of opencv, an open source computer vision library. We built it on a Mac OS using C++, python, matlab for image presentation, and shell scripts to run different scripts depending on changing inputs.  The project was a continuation of a previous successful implementation of the Faceswap algorithm with 5Wits adventure, an escape the room style challenge where participants unknowingly had their pictures taken and then swapped with the murderer of the crime. This project built on that repository by adding support for face mood input, a guiding process to obtain images, and the automations of a group of images into a gif or movie that tell a story. </p>\n<p>The images chosen for this particular story were based on group discussions of what topics (Frats, drugs, global warming, mental health) would elicit different reactions, even within a homogenous group like MIT. </p>\n<p>The CAD model was built using Autodesk Fusion 360. With the help of the autodesk members, we were able to design an exhibit space (similar to the one we will have in February due to MIT\u2019s grant), to better convey the impact of our project.  Models were taken from GrabCAD, mcmaster, and other open source 3D model repositories.</p>\n<p>And finally, the image capture (not the face detection) was done through matlab.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We spent a considerable amount of time choosing our storyline since the exhibition will be hosted in February at MIT, and we wanted a topic that would evoke strong emotions on both ends of the spectrum from the audience. We ultimately chose \u201chomelessness\u201d because we felt that it was a topic we could all relate to, as everyone has come into contact with someone who was homeless at some point.</p>\n<p>The lesson we learned is that creating our own content can sometimes be easier than researching online. In order to create our storyline, we needed various images to illustrate the narrative. Our initial approach was to search images from specific keywords that were relevant to our story. However, this process took us an enormously long time because most of the images felt too \u201cstaged\u201d and couldn\u2019t provide the realistic/relatable experience we wanted. In fact, we ended up having to take one of the pictures ourselves, in order to save time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, deciding on the format of the exhibition (whether individual experience or group experience) was equally challenging because our opinions were evenly divided. We decided to get a third party opinion from the mentors and reached a consensus based on popular vote.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to produce a strong pilot of an exhibit in just under 24 hours. The process required lots of defining of the story, end goals, and what empathy means to different people. We were also able to get over certain hurdles as a team, including not having a single person trained as a software engineer, learning that a visual model would be beneficial one hour before the deadline, and fighting back the urge to sleep. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned from small focus groups and our own hackathon brainstorm that the ideal conditions for empathy vary widely from person to person.  We learned that empathy is not just a factor of how relatable the character is, but also how long you allow someone to \u201cget to know\u201d the character.\nThe biggest lesson is that we should generate our own content for better stories. We searched the web for appropriate images, and unfortunately, when we couldn\u2019t find what we envisioned, we had the image we found determine the next path of the story. Not only that, but the face swap algorithm cannot take into account obstructed faces very well. If instead, we are the photographers taking pictures of scenes to tell a story, we have total control of the narrative as well as more control of how well the FaceSwap app will function. </p>\n<h2>What's next for About Face</h2>\n<p>What you see before you today is only the beginning. We expect the piece to actually premier in the MIT Student Center in February, where responses to the piece with be recorded and the recordings will be placed online, along with a virtual version of the piece, allowing the whole word access to the this conversation on empathy. </p>\n<p>We view this About Face exhibit at MIT in Feb 2017 as a pilot to gather data on people\u2019s genuine reactions to various stories and how they differ. We will use this pilot data to create more emotionally impactful stories. About Face can be used to personalize any story and capture genuine emotional reactions to that story: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>As an edtech tool to personalize and teach history to young students, for example, teaching the US civil war to high school students using their own faces to encourage relation and empathy to historic stories to increase engagement, retention, and learning. \n</li><li>Once you start personalizing history lessons, why not personalize interactive stories for children, or comic books?\n</li><li>Use About Face to imagine yourself in someone else\u2019s Snapchat or Instagram stories. \n</li></ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a

It remaps our spatial sense to our auditory sense. We can now hear space and see harmony;  Your position X (left,right), Y (up, down) and Z (forward, back) become pitch-shifting controllers of 3 separate musical notes. This means that every location in space is a \"possibly-harmonic\" location. Like pokemon floating in special places, this world has orbs that show you the exact locations of Major Chords, Minor Chords, and more.  Never-before have we had the accessible, 3D space-tracking and augmented reality capabilities the Hololens provides. We exploit that power to visualize harmony, and auralize space.</p>\n<h2>How We built it:</h2>\n<p>We used the Hololens' spatial/location mapping abilities to know where our user is in 3D space. We then got a hold of our user's X,Y, and Z coordinates, using each to modify the pitch of a sustained musical note-- one for each note of a three-part musical chord respectively.  We then placed small orbs in the environment at X,Y,Z positions the correspond to musical harmonies (we chose points whose coordinates create a major chord).    We used Unity, C#, musical frequency data crunching, Hololens SDK, and Redbull.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into:</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we ran into was the fact that Hololens starts the global coordinate system origin (0,0,0) at the viewer's head. We really wanted it at the viewers feet. People are different sizes ...

This inspired us to create Art1st to provide an accessible and  daily artistic experience for all people.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When the user opens the app each day, they are presented with three famous artworks, each with a concise, simple description. No jargon, no academic language, just one fresh perspective to inspire them to think and explore. They can react by liking it and tapping for more info. Or they can simply ignore it. Meanwhile, we collect data on their preferences and adjust the content we offer them. In a simple version of the algorithm we\u2019ve already implemented, two of the three presented artworks will be from some of their preferred categories, and one from a random category, to keep it personalized but also fresh and surprising.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Adobe XD to design and prototype the UI. We used Java to code the algorithm, and Android Studio to code the mobile application. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One issue we considered was that of attracting people to try the app. We believe that schools are good place to start. Students are curious and willing to try new things, and Art1st could serve as an arts supplement in the many schools whose art programs are underfunded or nonexistent. Additionally, students could introduce their parents and other adult friends and family to create a wider audience for the app. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We created an intelligent and effective UI design for Art1st, and we also created an algorithm that would enhance users' art experiences. We jumped into something we had very little experience in and were able to make something we're proud of.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the importance of teamwork and the benefits of working with people with a diversity of skill sets and backgrounds. We also learned the importance of reviewing each of our ideas critically, and addressing issues with practicality and scalability early on in the planning process. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Art1st</h2>\n<p>We also envision adding a social element, where people can interact with their friends, competing to level up by \"collecting\" paintings and earning experience points by visiting their \u201cgallery\u201d often, and reacting to the paintings. Leveling up also opens the door to new sets of paintings to explore in daily galleries.  </p>\n<p>In addition, our app has strong potential for commercialization for two reasons. Firstly, we can partner with art institutions. We can add value by pushing events that users might be interested in based on their preference and perhaps by sponsored by art institutions. Secondly, as we attract more users, the preference data we collected can be very valuable for art institutions and vendors in regards to what people like and what they are interested in.</p>\n<p>Curating algorithm prototype:\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_uzZZGOXtEU\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a></p>\n<p>Android prototype:\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hDE76TiEd2E\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">adobe-xd</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I helped design the UI for our app, particularly the timeline and navigation drawer (side menu).

Everyday motions can become art; a piece of music can represent someone's daily life. This concept can be used for music education in underprivileged schools, a way to turn sign language into an auditory signal, an alternative medium to social media to share our lives in an artistic representation, or a way to make composing music accessible to anyone. Art and motions are fundamental to our lives, and the applications of the concept of turning motions into art are endless. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>So far we've developed a way to convert motion data from a Myo wristband into chords. So far it has the features that the accelerometer data controls pitches, and the EMG data controls pitch duration. This allows large ranges of motion to create music with a wide pitch range, and allows for motions where the hand is squeezed to output faster, more intense music.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Myo wristband to obtain motion data, and manipulated the data in Mathematica to get musical outputs.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The Myo wristband outputs a lot of data, but it's also quite noisy-- we smoothed the data by using moving averages.</li>\n<li>We had to build a way to map accelerometer data to pitches. At first, we mapped data to frequencies, but this resulted in sound frequencies that weren't actually notes, so we had to figure out a way to map to specific note frequencies to actually make music.</li>\n<li>We have so many more ideas we want to try, and not nearly enough time to realize all of them!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud that we got code working to turn motions into sound. We've shown that it's definitely possible, and with more work, it can become a great tool.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We had an amazing experience, and learned that there's so much you can do with some data manipulation. Life is art!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Life is Art</h2>\n<p>We have not yet used the orientation or gyro data given by the Myo wristband. We can use this data to add more musical elements to make the music we have so far more aesthetically pleasing. We would like to add features where the wristband can recognize specific movements so that we can make music in real time. We would also like to try having people wearing the Myo wristbands over periods of weeks, so we can see interesting repetitions and the unique motions in peoples lives, which would make for great music. Implementing this concept for specific purposes such as education or for medical applications would require more work into being able to recognize specific motion signals. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">myo-wristbands</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mathematica</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Performance Across Scales", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dQSEtSxQsw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Performance Across Scales \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/448/750/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>The goal of our product is to firstly reimagine the relationship between audience and performers and secondly to turn theatrical performance which normally takes place in a small enclosed space into a different scale in this urban environment. </p>\n<p>We are envisioning the whole city we live in as a performing stage in which each person is constantly immersed into this symphony of the city by playing his or her small character.
