We wanted to tackle this issue and think of a natural, intuitive, and useful way to do it. This led us to focus on the ideation process, where many small voices with great ideas get drowned out by larger voices with poor ideas. Iterating on the idea to make it intuitive and useful to managers and teams (we talked to a lot of mentors -- user research!), we finally came up with Ideaback. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The web app allows teams to anonymously introduce ideas to an overall idea map, where they can link dependent ideas together and then subsequently \"vote\" on ideas to give them weight. After collaborating on this app for just a short while, patterns and insights begin to emerge as the group collectively inputs their ideas and feedback. Prominent ideas grow larger in size, linked ideas are grouped by colour, and interdependent ideas increase in size together. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used HTML/CSS with JavaScript to build the front-end interface and Node.js with Express.js to build the back end. Collaboration is enabled using Socket.io, and we have an Ubuntu server running on Linode. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Overall, the entire project was challenging as it was the first time for many of us working with Node, Express, and Arbor, as well as the first time we've ever deployed a web app to a server. Some specific difficulties we ran into: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>collaboration:</em> the real-time inputs of ideas and updating the interface for all users was challenging to execute, but we learned how to use Socket.io to help make this easier.</li>\n<li><em>new languages:</em> JS was fairly new for all of us programming and using Express caused us to have to duplicate and shift around many files, breaking some of our pre-existing links.</li>\n<li><em>servers:</em> we tried deploying the app to several cloud systems, like Heroku and Meteor but they had dependencies that we didn't build into our code. In the end, Jeff at Linode was very helpful at 5AM and we were able to set up a Linux server.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Definitely that the web app looks great and actually has almost all of the functionalities that we had aimed to create! More importantly, we're proud of how well our team worked together to solve problems and help each other learn.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hackatbrown.cathy-chen.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hackatbrown.cathy-chen.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackatbrown.cathy-chen.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I deployed our app on a Linux server, and helped with Node.js.

It is a guide to the best attractions, curated by locals. It is broken into five main categories: eat, explore, learn, party, and shop. It is designed to have a personalized feel, headlined by the question, \"What do you want to do?\"</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We divided our team into three main sections: research, development, and design. We had 3 developers and two designers on the team, and split up the work between ourselves. While the developers structured the back end, the designers created graphic elements. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a surprisingly low amount of problems, even in this constrained time restrictions. Our main focus was keeping the lines of communication clear among designers and developers and double checking to make sure our wireframes and ideas were possible. We also had a few tech hiccups creating the website and getting everything to lay out correctly, however our developers were able to collaborate together and problem solve. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Overall we are very proud of the project as a whole. We all brought a unique skill to the table and we were able to work together and create a product that was responsive, unique, and well designed.

The Band will live feed heart rate data to the application and allow users to personalize their data.  At this point, the application will determine which mood you are experiencing every half an hour and notify the user to write a message indicating what they were experiencing during that time(i.e. they are happy because they won a soccer game).  All data is stored in the cloud, and is pushed from MongoDb.  From there, this data is pushed to the web application, hosted on Microsoft Azure, where we used D3 and Beaker to create a visualization of the user's heart rate compared to time of day.  At this point the web application determines what your average mood of the day was and then will make a recommendation for you to change your mood to the desired mood.  So, for example, if your day averages depressed, the application will recommend for you to watch a video of puppies and link you straight to it.</p>\n<h2>Changing the World</h2>\n<p>The real world application of this project is to help patients suffering from mental illness track their triggers.  This will let them know what life events trigger different emotions, and it will allow doctors to track their patients emotions.  For example, this will help doctors understand the mood swings and emotion differentiations of patients with BiPolar Disorder as well as help those with anxiety track what their trigger events are for panic attacks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">beaker</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vim\">vim</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongolab\">mongolab</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kaitlingu/emotion-viz.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kaitlingu/emotion-viz.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://happyheart.azurewebsites.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://happyheart.azurewebsites.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>happyheart.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built the iOS application", "", "", ""]], ["Poseidon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration -</h2>\n<p>After viewing Firebase's online earthquake database, we were inspired to create a project that gives people a better sense of the information as well providing them with opportunities to assist with long-term and short-term disaster relief. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project has several features - our homepage visualizes all earthquakes that happened within the past year. Earthquake color, radius, and opacity change depending on the earthquake's magnitude and how long ago it occurred. Users can also click on the \"Take Me Here\" button to see a Google Street View of the area at the epicenter of the earthquake. </p>\n<p>The Quakes near me page allows users to find earthquakes relatively close to their area.

We modified their basic earthquake map to make a more interactive and informational homepage, and to create an \"earthquake locator\" on our quakes near me page. The entire page was built using bootstrap to give our html/css a cleaner look. Our \"Help Out\" page also features a Twitter Widget, which features the Red Cross' Twitter feed. All interactive features of the page were built using java script, and we used many features of the Google Maps API.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many. The interactive map could be quite tricky at times, and the css required quite a bit of fiddling to get the look we wanted. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The whole thing! Our website is fully responsive, and uses many interesting features of the google maps API with great effect (which we had never used before). </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Although we did not end up launching our site with amazon web service, we set up a virtual machine using ubuntu and nginx that could be launched with a secure certificate should we decide to later purchase a domain name.

The requirement is that a threshold of the provider's payments have to use a secure messaging platform in order for patient s to contact providers and log provider-patient communication. There is a big problem, however, with the existing system. Less than 17% of hospitals meet this requirement, \"which hinders our nation\u2019s ability to improve the quality, safety, cost-effectiveness, and access to care\" says Carla Smith - Executive Vice President of Healthcare Information and Management Systems. The problem occurs because less than 5% of patients are actually using the current systems. This is because the current systems are outdated and difficult to use. In addition, some of the systems require the patient to download software and go through complicated steps just in order to contact the provider. Especially since Medicare patients are elderly, this greatly inhibits the use of the platforms. Some of the platforms use chat-based systems, but this is a difficult interface for patients with arthritis or with poor eyesight. </p>\n<p><strong>Our Solution</strong>\nVoiceCare is the secure messaging system that patients will actually use. This is because we are reinventing the way patients use the system. It is very simple for any patient - elderly or disabled  - to use the platform. All they need to do is call the provider's number they have been assigned. They leave a message and that is it. No complicated software download. No cumbersome chat-based systems. The provider then can log into our web interface of VoiceCare and see a list of all the patients. The provider can hear all of the voice calls that the patients have left through the web interface. The web interface prioritises voice calls that have not been heard and marks them as done when heard. The web interface keeps a log of all the calls from each patient. With VoiceCare, providers can meet the Medicare requirements, patients can have easier access to contact their provider, and overall the quality, safety, cost-effectiveness and access to care will greatly improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Building it</strong>\nIn order to make the web interface, we used React. For the backend we used MongoDB, Heroku, Node, Express and the Twilio API.The biggest challenge was connecting the voice calls to the web interface and displaying them to the provider. We are proud that we got a functioning version of the web application to work. </p>\n<p><strong>The Learning Experience</strong>\n2/3 of our team are new to hackathons, so it was a learning experience for us to participate in our first hackathon. In addition, we learned more about React and the Twilio API.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag

In today's world of finance, much of that meaning has been lost, especially with amounts in the millions, billions, and trillions that are difficult for humans to even conceptualize. What's a dollar? Does anybody really know?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>How Many Pens turns dollar amounts on the pages you visit into their \"equivalents\" in actual things. Those jeans on Amazon? 2.1 pounds of uranium. Facebook's IPO? Peak market cap of 10.41 billion months of Netflix. Your checking account? 1.78 Canada Goose jackets. One can also opt to see only equivalents in BIC Pens, hence the name of the extension.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a Chrome extension using Javascript. It finds dollar amounts on pages using a regex, parses out the value, and replaces it with the equivalent from a manually-curated list of goods.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Amounts like \"$1 billion\" were slightly more difficult to find/replace. We eventually decided to transform the dollar amount, then append the item name after the \"trillion/billion/million/thousand,\" e.g. $30 million -&gt; 1.78 billion paper clips.</p></li>\n<li><p>Contextual capitalization (e.g. in article titles) was difficult, since our regex only captured the dollar amount and none of the words around it.

It's a good resource for getting the general idea of a topic to know where to start yet more often than not, you run into (This article needs improvement), (Original Research) or the dreaded [citation needed]. So can you trust the information that you find on those pages? \nIn addition, once you do begin searching for primary sources, you often find that you need to perform multiple searches of the structure (topic + related words) in order to locate the relevant information.  We decided to automate this process.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Wiki Alexandria takes a Wikipedia page and distills it down to a list of key words. These words are then sent out in the format (topic + related word) in a query to multiple databases of published academic sources (google scholar, refseek, arxiv) and sorts the results to get the top 10 articles that appear most often among the combined searches.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>1) There were not APIs for either Refseek or Google Scholar both had to be made from scratch as html parsers.\n2) Due to the nature of the API usage (extremely high volume to perform all of the match up queries) we ran in to MANY rate limit problems on both of these services. They kept detecting our trawler as a search engine bot and shut us out before more than one search could be performed.  This occurred for both the Refseek and Google Scholar API.\n3) Issues with enabling asynchronous requests\n4) Two of the APIs we wanted to use were not available during the 24 hrs. Microsoft's Academic Search API required an app id that had to be requested via email as it was in beta, given that it is a weekend it is highly unlikely that the manager of the API ever saw our email. JSTOR's API is only available to research organizations.\n5) Due to the limitations of API request speed, requests take a long time to run the first time.  To combat this, once searched results are cached.  Some example searches already cashed include Gorilla Glass, Spectral Geometry and Web Crawler.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Interpreting html takes a lot of time and if one string is wrong the whole thing doesn't work properly, even if it doesn't throw an error</li>\n<li>better python skills</li>\n<li>implementation of asynchronous requests </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Wiki Alexandria</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>implementation of Digital Public Library of America's API for primary source information</li>\n<li>sort algorithm to weigh the top-ten results from each database to compile an overall top ten list</li>\n<li>cache more pages</li>\n<li>implement a more humanities centered database</li>\n<li>better website UI</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arxiv\">arxiv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-scholar</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">refseek</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/beautiful-soup\">beautiful-soup</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tornado\">tornado</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://45.33.90.53:8080\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://45.33.90.53:8080\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>45.33.90.53</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Smackdown", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Smackdown \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/597/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When spectating important football events or halfheartedly taking part in America's political process, it's important to make an informed decision before you jump on a bandwagon. </p>\n<p>Smackdown gives you an inside look at the fan bases' smack talk expertise before you decide who to root for today.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Smackdown analyzes current tweets about the teams, and assigns each tweet a Smack Score.\nThe team with the higher aggregate Smack Score is winning the Smackdown.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Smackdown</h2>\n<p>Smackdown plans to sit down with a nice bowl of guac and enjoy the Superbowl later today. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Did the frontend!

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As a team we often listen to music together. We noticed that although we listen to some of the same music, the playlists that we streamed from as a group were often too tailored towards one individual's musical preferences. We wanted an easy way to make a playlist of all the songs we have in common without manual looking through our hundreds of songs. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It creates a single, accessible Spotify playlist that is customized to fit the needs of many people at once. </p>\n<p>Here's how it works. Each group member logs into Spotify through the Wayvepool portal. The app scans each user's playlists and compares track data between users. The app finds what songs people have in common and organizes them into one master playlist that everyone will enjoy.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used an Apache Tomcat Java server for the back-end code.  This was interfaced with a MongoDB database through a Java-Mongo library. For design we used Sketch 3 to develop logos and images. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge was working with the Spotify API. It was easy to create most of the functionality, but get user permission was our first big challenge. Then once we collected the correct data from Spotify it was an issue to send it back correctly to our application. At one point the application functioned properly and developed some good custom playlists, but at some point it stopped sending song IDs in the correct format. This was an issue that we attempted to fix up until deadline but eventually fixed. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of successfully utilizing the Spotify API, despite its lack of clear documentation. We took time to develop a clean interface as well. In the end it feels good to have a new playlist in our libraries that is actually useful and a result of what we built. We also are proud of the simplicity of the application - its not a fully functioning product, rather a simple tool that does its job. We came into Hack@Brown with intentions to learn, and luckily ended up creating an application that we would want to use in real life. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to divide work well, a task that was an issue at the start of the project. We also learned that proper planning let us start developing really quick off the start. Finally, we learned that small issues in portions of code could cause huge problems down the line - we ran into an issue where our code stopped correctly accessing the Spotify API. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Wayvepool</h2>\n<p>There is a lot for potential for customized group music listening. Though there are certainly collaborative playlists out there, this is a simple tool that can quickly make one for any group. We may add additional features where the application can identify shared music tastes and then include songs that are predicted to be enjoyed everyone in the group. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">java-mongo</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BykQ0tLw7UV5QTBmTHNQVDg1VEU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BykQ0tLw7UV5QTBmTHNQVDg1VEU\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Bud", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bud \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/583/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bud \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/584/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bud \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/585/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bud \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/586/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bud \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/587/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bud \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/588/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bud \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/589/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanted to create an emotive scuplture to connect with users on a more natural, tangible level and allow them to effortlessly check in with crucial aspects of their lives.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Blooms with the weather, lights for the mood/physical state of the user.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Designed it in Solidworks and with a lot of sketches, then laser cut some plywood, strung it together, and hooked it up to an Arduino and stepper motor.

It seemed like a really cool place to hang out and as we discussed random ideas, one idea that stuck out was the fact that people need more surprise in life.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>So we decided to build a platform that would create a separate 'travel' savings accounts for our users and everytime they made a transaction with their Capital One cards, the remainder of the amount that rounds up to the nearest whole number is transferred from their checkings to this travel accounts. For example, if an item costs $9.60, the remaining 40 cents that round it up to $10 will be moved to the travel accounts. Over time as the money accumulates, we would do a constant background check with Rome2Rio and TripAdvisor and pull possible trips based on the account balance. This would not only create a more interesting travel portfolio for people but also make people live with surprises and make quick travel decisions.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We envisioned this as a website so we started building with HTML5, CSS3, PHP and MySQL. We used JavaScript to make API calls to Capital One's API and do things like create the travel accounts, transfer money to the travel account etc. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We couldn't even get close to finishing the project because Capital One's API was not working well with JavaScipt at all of our post requests were getting denied (because of their network security). We weren't very happy about that. We could have built this entire platform had their API supported us.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>I wish we had something to say here. But this hackathon didn't prove to be very motivating for us as the project we envisioned couldn't be realized.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that JavaScript is a very unstable language for API calls.

XPLOR facilitates users to easily find a volunteer activity they are interested in and help the world.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>XPLOR makes volunteering as easy as a swipe! XPLOR exposes users to variety of volunteer activities in the local area. Events are filtered based on distance, age requirements, and fields of interest, such as environment, education, and children. The events are saved, and the app tracks user volunteer hours. User events are then saved directly to your phone's calendar. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We decided to use Objective-C to build XPLOR. Most of our team were first-time users of the language! We created our own icons for filtering events, and also set the filters to be based on distance, age, and interests of the volunteer event. We used a swipe card library to create the events view and imported raw open data to populate each slide with pictures, event information, and times.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We started off using the LinkedIn API with the aim of matching students with internships, and after five hours of going through their sample code, we deemed the venture a fail to start over again.

Currently, this is a feature not offered on Google Maps or Transit, two major public transit apps.

You will also get a notification at 400 meters and another to alert the driver.</p>\n<p>It's an app that will save time, energy, and an Uber ride.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We downloaded Android Studio, utilized a bunch of APIs, and with the help of our mentor Caroline Duby, we tried to design an app that was intuitive, simple, and easy to use.

Chomsky is the intelligent-being behind Twaiku.</p>\n<p>We liked the idea of a twitter client that only allows users to post haikus, but we wanted something more.  We wanted a tool to generate haikus with user input.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Twaiku: Twitter with Haikus. Twaiku is a twitter client that only allows users to post in haikus. Its signature feature: Chomsky will help generate haikus for you.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Team:\nBackend: Joel Gustafson + Robert Tran\nFrontend: Kenny Friedman + Nick Gomez</p>\n<p>The Tech:\nThe back-end haiku magic happens with NLTK, a massive toolkit for natural language processing in Python. The iOS app connects to the server with a websocket, allowing us to update our haiku generation model with minimal latency. Users simply need to start writing whatever is on their mind, and Chomsky will help you generate poetic masterpieces with its quick algorithms.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The immediate and clear challenge coming into this project was a fast algorithm that could generate haikus seamlessly. Speed was a top priority. We wanted to be able to suggest future words given sequence of words and also be able to suggest words in between a sequence of words. Other challenges included being able to detect the number of syllables in a word and autocomplete words from partial characters. </p>\n<p>For our initial phase, we started with Microsoft's language processing tools: the  'Language Understanding Intelligent Service' and the 'Web Language Model API'. After producing a working algorithm to generate haikus in around 14 seconds apiece, we concluded that it simply wasn't fast enough and needed to look for another solution. </p>\n<p>We turned to NLTK. Using its large library of samples of English texts,  we pursued its 'trigram' tools. Trigrams allow us to look at chains of triples of words that occur frequently together. With some researching and hacking, we were able to produce promising results in millisecond time ranges. As it is, we are confident in Twaiku's ability to suggest future words, but the ability to fill in words in between or before a sequence of words quickly remains unfinished, due to the forward-chaining nature of the trigram model.</p>\n<p>The other main challenge was the UI. As users input words, our haiku generation model was being updated in real-time to the user. The challenges included being able to make dynamic UI elements and manipulate strings to create a pleasant experience of haiku writing. Also, our team had never used Swift before. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we are proud the collection of haikus Twaiku was able to generate. Throughout the hackathon, we would marvel at our generated haikus - even writing them on the chalkboard for everyone to reflect on.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the UI is amazing. </p>\n<p>Lastly, we were able to create a fast solution to haiku generation.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Among our group members, we were first time learners of natural language processing, swift programming, web sockets, and twitter API. We are excited about Chomsky and Twaiku is able to do, but our solutions to haiku generation have many implications for us outside of Twaiku.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Twaiku</h2>\n<p>We want a polished product that we can deploy to the world. This includes adding features to our iOS app, developing an Android app, and making our backend robust and scalable.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["FitPup - fitness tracker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FitPup - fitness tracker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/150/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>meet your companion (gif in app)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FitPup - fitness tracker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/151/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>postive encouragement (gif in app)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FitPup - fitness tracker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/152/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>welcome screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FitPup - fitness tracker \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/153/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>sad results (gif in app)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FitPup - fitness tracker \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/155/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>sad gif</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FitPup - fitness tracker \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/156/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>app icon</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FitPup - fitness tracker \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/157/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>happy gif</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our childhood tamagotchi toys.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>An iOS application health tracker for steps that is inspired by a tamagotchi.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote the app in Swift using Xcode.

These days there's an app on your phone that can replace carrying objects from cameras to GPS devices. Our app replaces the need to carry a ruler, because let's be honest -- does anyone really carry a ruler around anymore?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We created the Ruling Ruler, an app that measures the length of any object that the camera points to, according to the angle formed between the object and the phone. Begin with the phone flat on a surface, and after it is calibrated, the user rotates the phone upwards using the bottom of the phone as the vertex. Once the edge of the object is at the crosshairs/target, the user can tap calculate to get the calculated length of the object. The angle will also remain on the screen for any further use, and the user can press the button again to recalibrate and calculate the length of another object.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Swift in XCode for coding the application, and Adobe Illustrator for the graphics.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we had planned to measure objects through tracking the acceleration of the phone in one plane, so that the user can move the phone forward and backward on the plane of the screen, but we realized that the accelerometer accumulates to many errors over time for the measurement to be even mildly close to the real length of the object. Because of this hardware limitation, we completely changed our approach to creating a ruler application and used the gyroscope data instead.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team of all first time hackers, we're proud that we learned Swift from scratch and that we were able to make our first iOS app in less than 24 hours! Additionally, we're happy that the motion from the calibration angle works properly and is very sensitive. Best of all, the app is actually fairly accurate with about a 1 cm margin of error!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As mentioned, we learned and have a basic understanding of coding in Swift and using XCode! We also learned that an app can be built in as little as 10 hours with lots of dedication, caffeine, and snacks!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ruling Ruler</h2>\n<p>Given more time, we will develop our app to be able to detect rotation along different axes so that the user can also calibrate the angle by holding the phone to a wall and rotating it off the wall (parallel to the ground). We also want to include more options within the app to allow users to change the units of length and to have a simple instructions screen so the app is easier to understand. Our ultimate goal is to come up with an algorithm using the motion data in the phone that allows users to measure the length of curved objects too.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["camera view and some graphics", "I worked on the code for the motion data updates, button response, and label updates.", "", ""]], ["traid", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Oftentimes the batteries in our phones die quickly, preventing our friends or family from contacting us. Especially in the case of an emergency, it would be convenient if there was some way for our friends and family to communicate with each other without necessarily having the other's contact information. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This app allows users to create a profile, where they can add up to five top friends, and five top family members. In the case of an emergency, these circles of friends and families of the user can communicate through the messenger component of this app. Conversely, the user can access the family or friends circles of others who have added him/her to one of their circles. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Firebase iOS platform to create and hold a database of users, their personal information such as phone number, and their connection circles.

The constant bombarding of information from hundreds of different sources led us to create one central place for sharing events. \nIt's 2016 - there's no need to continue to share, memorize, and try to find events on paper.<br/>\nFacebook events only reach invited friends, there's no way to let the whole campus/area know about an event.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows users and hosts to create events (anonymously if they wish), specifying a place on the map, time, and details.\nUsers can up vote or down vote the events to prevent against spam.  You can comment on events and search.\nYou can easily scroll through the days to see whats happening from today to next year.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Xcode and Swift to create the mobile front-end, and the backend using a LAMP stack.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting autolayout to work across devices and orientations.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We got it demonstrable!

Something I encounter almost on a daily basis. Using our device, we can send a notification to your smart-watch or Google Glass with their name.</p>\n<p>Or, if you are at a conference and need to find other people with similar interests or work areas, but introductions are tough - using our app we can pull up all the LinkedIn profiles of the people around. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The device works by first taking an image using either a mobile, smart-watch or Google Glass and passing it through our app onto our server which then uses Microsoft's Project Oxford API to cross reference it with other photos from LinkedIn and Facebook. Once a match is found, the persons name and profile is sent to your smart watch / google glass and voila, you know their name! </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We broke down the idea into multiple subparts and divided it across the team. Our first tasks involved being able to hack the Android phone so that we can obtain a camera feed live onto a web server so we could then download and run it through Project Oxford, for which we used a python script. We also had to find a way to collect data from Facebook and LinkedIn and train the API.</p>\n<p>Post the initial stages, we developed an Android app for the mobile and a Microsoft Band app to collect and present the data. The Android mobile app acts like a relay between the Microsoft Band and the server. Once we were able to have all the devices communicate with each other, we trained our API to speed up the recognition process. Lastly, we spent our remaining time tidying up the backend and improving the user experience for the front end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our main challenges came from the cap Microsoft Project Oxford has (20 image verifications per minute) and being able to communicate between the Android and the Microsoft Band. Also, we were unable to post our entire app on a online server such as Linode due to Brown University's firewall. We were able to accomplish the online server on Linode using VPNs, however, due to the time-lag induced by the VPN, we were unable to use it for our final demonstration. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The link between the Microsoft API and the camera and all the python script in between was the most challenging yet the most rewarding aspect of the project. Also, using the Microsoft Band is an accomplishment we are proud off, along with the ability of our device to scan and recognise faces relatively quickly (almost realtime) and fairly accurately (8/10 times it was a success during testing)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to build an app on Windows Band and Android phone.\nHow to hack the camera of the Samsung Note 4.\nHow to use the Microsoft Project Oxford API and collecting data from Linkedin\nHow to get Android phone app to communicate with the Microsoft Band and a server we set up.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Remember me</h2>\n<p>To have the entire system either constrained in one mobile app, or an app and a server. Currently, we have the server set-up but because of Brown's firewall, we are unable to access it outside Brown's wifi. </p>\n<p>Also, we hope to move away from photo based detection to real time video feed detection thereby removing the need to take multiple photos. This could ideally be done using Open CV and have it a multilayer filter: first filtering based upon gender to reduce our pool, and the face verification after having trained our API.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">windows-band</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/laurapang/hackbrown-image-recognition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/laurapang/hackbrown-image-recognition\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the python backend to pull the databases and match and identify the live streaming of the person.", "", "", ""]], ["FistBump", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FistBump \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/819/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FistBump \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/816/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FistBump \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/817/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FistBump \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/344/818/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Fist Bump</h2>\n<p><strong>Empathizing with your bros*, through the highs...and the through the lows.</strong></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This project is inspired by the idea of harnessing the collective power of human empathy towards social good.

For many, the difficulty associated with meeting others is seemingly insurmountable and disheartening. That's where OddJobs comes in. Oddjobs functions both as a means of introducing people as well as making odd jobs accessible. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>OddJobs combines the communication means of a message board with advantages of talking with others nearby. In the social meetups tab, users can post events, or even plans they have and find others who may be interested in taking part. On the other hand, in the \"Work\" tab, users can post jobs of varying difficulty and seek out the services of their peers. The jobs could range from help putting together a shelf to tutoring in courses. Users can also send and receive payments for jobs through the app as well. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Android-SDK to develop the application components. The mockups were created in Sketch. Some individual elements were rendered in other programs including InDesign, Photoshop and LightRoom. We also used git for version control and file sharing. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>OddJobs was initially created as an Android application. While two members of the team has experience as Android users, none of us had worked on Android app development before. Jib and Peter worked on the front end side of the app despite never working with the Android-SDK before. Jib had some prior experience with Java but not in this capacity so there was some initial difficulty in creating the app elements. Elicia worked on the backend of the app. While she had some previous experience creating and maintaining forums, she had little experience working with mySQL to create and maintain databases. In general, the majority of the problems experienced were the result of a lack of experience or prior knowledge. While frustrating at times, working on a project in an environment no one on the team used before created ample opportunities to learn and grow as engineers, teammates and developers. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team, we are all proud of the fact we were able to create the parts of a working Android application practically overnight, especially considering this was a totally new experience for all of us. We are also proud of our ability to collaborate and find ways to make the most of our various and often different intentions and ideas. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the excitement of developing an Android application. Additionally, we also learned about the Andrpid-SDK, backend development, git, and how to collaborate on programs. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Meet | Work</h2>\n<p>Going forward, we would like to add geofencing to further specify the community or area in which posts are to be seen. This will allow users to see only the most relevant posts to them and increase productivity of the app. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lightroom</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend and design of the app. I helped with the mockup as well as the implementation of got and structuring the data inputs.

While being a woman in computer science is great and rewarding, belonging to an underrepresented category can be extremely discouraging, and it's easy for a woman to feel isolation from her STEM community. However, we are never alone. When STEM women are disheartened and in need of help, there are tons of other women out there who can relate to the feeling, and they would be glad to help a fellow STEM woman in need. The only problem is-- how do we find these people, and how do we match potential mentors with needing mentees?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our website, Mentopea, essentially matches mentorship-seeking mentees with mentors who are willing to guide them. While searching, mentees input \"tags\" to narrow down their search. For example, if a mentee is looking for someone who specializes in Java programming, they may input the tag \"Java\". From there, a search is performed on our database, and when matches are found, these mentors' profiles are displayed.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We explored the scope of front end &amp; backend web dev design. We used Adobe CS6, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create our frontend of our website. We focused to make it aesthetically pleasing and user friendly as best to our abilities. We learned MongoDB and Flask to create the backend to store, manipulate and run data of the mentors and mentees from our database to display on our website.</p>\n<p>Our domain name: <a href=\"http://www.mentopea.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mentopea.com</a></p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>For the majority of us, this has been the first time we have worked with any type of web application. It's difficult to find a starting place and find the right resources to start creating a website from scratch. While the Hack@Brown mentors were able to help in the right direction, it wasn't smooth sailing from there (of course.) We particularly had trouble implementing databases, which proved to be more challenging then we had expecting.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>As an all female group, we are proud of our accomplishments in completing a functioning web application with a cool back-end. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to implement and manipulate Bootstrap for the front-end design. We used for the first time how to use MongoDB &amp; Flask for the backend.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mentopea</h2>\n<p>We hope to expand our product by adding new features such as a crowdsourcing ratings of mentors, comment system and showing availabilities of users when they are online. We chose to use a web application platform in order to expand to different platforms easily.
