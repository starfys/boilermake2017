If you let someone use your laptop, they can get access to your unencrypted passwords in a matter of seconds if you have autofill enabled. And if your computer's password is compromised, all your saved passwords are also compromised (since most browser based password managers rely on your system's password or password vault). To battle this issue, I developed DoubleAuth which is a chrome password manager that requires authentication from the user's smartphone before autofilling password forms on websites.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>DoubleAuth is a chrome password manager that requires authentication from the user's smartphone before autofilling password forms on websites. The computer stores passwords, each encrypted with a random 40-byte key, and the smartphone stores each random key. Thus if the computer is compromised, the attacker only has access to passwords, each of which is encrypted with AES and a 40-byte key. If the phone is compromised, it only contains random keys, none of which are useful without the encrypted passwords. (Go to 0:55 in the video for a demo)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I used Google's chrome extension sdk to write the password manager.</li>\n<li>I used Node.js and MySQL to write the backend, which manages the communication between the computer and the phone.</li>\n<li>I used Android Studio to develop the DoubleAuth Authentication android app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I'm not very familiar with developing backends and I had never used Node.js prior to this project, so I had to learn how to write code for Node and how Node.js works in a very limited amount of time.

Annually, a staggering $37 billion worth of mobile data gets wasted by Americans. What if you could somehow stop this wastage by renting out your unused data to others around you? Our aim is to provide this service.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WeeFee allows you to broadcast a Wi-Fi signal to other devices using your mobile data plan, keeping track of the amount of data each person consumes. Using this information, the people using your data plan can get billed based on how much they use. Surely, the cost of this data is at a fraction of what phone companies would charge. This allows you to make some money from your excess mobile data while also providing internet access to others who may want it. WeeFee also maintains the privacy of users and their activity, as it is built on top of current hotspot technology.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The WeeFee Android app interfaces with existing hotspot technology. We group users into two subsets - lenders and borrowers. Lenders automatically create hotspots that borrowers can recognize. In near real-time, we monitor the amount of data flowing out of connected borrowers and keep a running sum of this amount for each lender. </p>\n<p>No public API exists that lets us easily monitor network traffic or manage hotspots without root access. We got around this by delving deep into Android's source code and using Reflection to expose critical network functionality. We subsequently fed this data through an API we built running on top of a LAMP architecture hosted on AWS.</p>\n<p>Our approach is scalable, secure, and lightweight. We also built a data analytics layer so that users can monitor their activity on the application. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we faced was how to manipulate the WiFi hardware on the device. Android is especially troublesome because different hardware manufacturers support different levels of access - the platform itself is also fragmented, which made it very difficult to initially test functionality.</p>\n<p>As we mentioned above, no public APIs exist that let us set up hotspots or easily monitor network traffic. That doesn't mean the code is totally hidden, though! We used Reflection to access private API methods, which we then leveraged to automatically turn on hotspots with pre-configured SSIDs. </p>\n<p>To get around the traffic monitoring issue, we eventually discovered a way to grab the total amount of data sent by a device since it was last booted. Via some more clever hacks, we were able to extrapolate the amount of network traffic passed through a particular device in a given time interval.</p>\n<p>Once we got past this, we had to figure out a good way to identify these SSIDs. We experimented with GPS-based identification, but eventually settled on a more simple approach wherein we prefixed SSIDs with a unique identifier.</p>\n<p>Finally, we had to come up with a performant, battery efficient mechanism for logging all of this data and choosing between potentially numerous hotspots. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We finished a working prototype that lets users borrow and lend mobile data. This is what we set out to do!</p>\n<p>We're also especially happy with our UI, which allows users to easily use the application - there's a single page, the user has to click on a button, and they're off to the races. Our data analytics page is also pretty unique. We show traffic data for each node in a dynamic graph that updates in real time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about low level Android programming. In particular, how to use private internal Android APIs. We also learned how to effectively handle numerous background services and set up publicly accessible APIs using AWS.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WeeFee</h2>\n<p>The next steps for WeeFee include implementing an account management system with authentication and billing. There is definitely a need for WeeFee - we just need to get the word out.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/u3amar/WeeFee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/u3amar/WeeFee\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/adisri/LAHacks2016_server-side/tree/master\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/adisri/LAHacks2016_server-side/tree/master\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Led server-side development", "Led Android development", "", ""]], ["T233 Grouptify", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T233 Grouptify \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/402/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T233 Grouptify \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/404/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T233 Grouptify \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/401/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>None of us had groups when we went to the hackathon, so we tried to find people using the group formation, but it was slow and no one had any ideas.

Peeking out from the glass layer of the wall, it appears that a visually impaired man was walking along my class with a cane. Throughout the following weeks, there have been numerous times where he accidentally hit an object, and thinking that it was a wall, he had to detour although the path was totally clear. The American Community Survey estimates that around 700,000 Americans suffer from visual disabilities, with an additional 7 million population experience the prevalence of such disability. How would us, three individuals who have the gift of sight, help these people who are unable to sense what's in front of them?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>EyeSpot can be considered as an impaired person's virtual best friend. Through a series of available commands, EyeSpot can communicate with its user conversationally and guide them using their artificial eyes -- their camera's optic lenses. Users can ask EyeSpot about their surroundings, location and whereabouts. Furthermore, by scanning through users' friend list and recognizing their friends, EyeSpot is able to detect people around them and identifies if they are the user's friends, and will inform them if they are.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>EyeSpot was built using the Ionic Framework and deployed as an hybrid app on iPhone. We utilized at least five APIs from Microsoft Azure, some intelligence and analytics libraries in order to build our product.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially wanting to build it on a Gear VR, it proved to be too technically challenging as none of us had any prior experience with Unity and Android development. We had to pivot halfway through but...</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>...we were able to finish most of what we initially planned to achieve. We were able to integrate machine learning, big data (albeit with a relatively small dataset), facial recognition, vision processing and speech recognition in such a short period of time!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to have some knowledge prior to working on a product. We attempted to implement some technologies that we have zero experience on. Next time, probably it will be a good idea to consult experienced people or do some research about some technologies before we work on it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for EyeSpot</h2>\n<p>As it really has a practical use case and that helping the visually impaired was part of our initial goal too, we will try to improve EyeSpot and turn it into a product that benefits the thousands or millions of people who are visually impaired. However, some of the technology that we use as part of our solution are not advanced enough to be highly accurate, but we would love to see how we could improve these technologies too.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chriswongtv/eyespot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chriswongtv/eyespot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front-end", "", ""]], ["Jordyn", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jordyn \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/229/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home Screen of App</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Why?</h2>\n<p>1).

We looked to a couple projects and finally landed on one that we noticed one day in a local supermarket. We noticed that the form of communications or organizing employees and setting up new checkout lines relied on roving managers and walkie-talkies. We wanted to build an automated system that cut the excess work put upon managers and outdated technology of non-cellular radio communications.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>RowController is a \"devkit\" for store owners and retailers to build an semi- to wholly automated storefront with tools that monitor and manage customers and employees. RowController at this moment features three distinct products:</p>\n<p>(1) a firmware for cameras that tracks customer movement patterns and reports information to \n(2) a webapp that allows managers to track customer and employee movements in their store and create custom recipes with the camera to automate notifying employees through a\n(3) mobile phone app that employees use to receive notifications on where to be present at</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built three separate programs that inter-mesh with each other using a realtime database. <strong>Our camera firmware</strong> was built using C++ and uses cameras that track depth (such as the <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/kinect\" rel=\"nofollow\">kinect</a>) to track the amount of people within a particular region of a store.</p>\n<p>Our webapp was built using a node server and html5/es6/css3. Our node server is also our logic control center, that figures out what employees can be automatically assigned projects based on customer density or line length.</p>\n<p>Our iOS app was built with swift.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a huge challenge in the first day with our camera firmware, originally we were going to use facial tracking, but the issue arises-ed when someone turned their face around. So we decided to build a depth based tracking system that filtered out static objects. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of how much stuff we were able to implement in such a short time. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about computer vision when developing the firmware for the camera. We also learned a bit about iOS design, which neither of us really ever studied before.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rowcontroller</h2>\n<p>We want to wholly expand and flesh out the product into a true devkit for retailers, so they could integrate various firmware into things like security cameras and lights as well as expand into better monitoring employees including time worked and other cost saving measures.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://rowcontroller.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://rowcontroller.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rowcontroller.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["T73 Marvelous Questions", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T73 Marvelous Questions \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/269/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>What do you want to know?</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T73 Marvelous Questions \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/270/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Ask about the many iconic Marvel Superheroes and Supervillains!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T73 Marvelous Questions \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/276/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Find new comics containing your favorite characters!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T73 Marvelous Questions \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/277/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Learn more about new AND old comics!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T73 Marvelous Questions \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/292/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Get information on legendary Marvel events!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you ever felt overwhelmed by the vast universe that is Marvel Comics?

Then, ask us one of your marvelous questions! </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Ask our platform questions in plain English and watch as it understands your question and uses the robust Marvel API to find the answer you're looking for! It will answer any question that the Marvel API has information about.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We utilized a NodeJS backend using the Microsoft Language Understanding Intelligent Service(LUIS) and the Marvel API to help understand and answer your questions. We trained the LUIS with almost 400 different test inputs which we then categorized so it can intelligently predict the categorization of other phrases.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Marvel API had some limitations which required some creative solutions and algorithms in order to efficiently and effectively search the large database of characters, events, and comics. The Language Understanding Intelligent Service had to be trained extensively in order to allow our platform to understand a wide variety of wordings and question types.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We hope that our platform will open the knowledge contained in the Marvel API to both seasoned and newbie Marvel enthusiasts. We strove to achieve ease of use without limiting the scope of accessible knowledge. We designed the page to be simple yet full of information with a familiar feel for comic book fans. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to effectively and thoroughly utilize APIs such as Microsoft's Cognitive Services and Marvel's in order to accomplish a task. We also gained invaluable experience with web development and Javascript. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Marvelous Questions</h2>\n<p>The next step would be to continue to improve Marvelous Questions' ability to interpret and answer your questions and to expand the range of answerable questions by harnessing new resources across the Internet.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">marvel-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.marvelousquestions.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.marvelousquestions.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.marvelousquestions.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the frontend and the backend.

That's why we built Sign Signature: the same signature that you have learned over the years can be used as an authentication system to unlock access to various native and web services.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sign Signature can be used as either an alternate login system or as a part of a two-factor authentication system for even more security. After logging in with their username, users will be prompted to sign their signature on our iOS app, which acts as a medium of collecting signatures, allowing the user to then gain access to a variety of services which use our authentication system. The signatures are then verified via a convolutional neural network, which has been trained to identify different signatures corresponding to each user. Once the server verifies the signature is a match, the user can login is safely.</p>\n<p>We implemented our authentication system on both web and native applications, showing its versatility. The native application implements two-factor authentication, requiring a password as well as signature verification. On the other hand, the web application is lightweight and only requires a quick signature to log in. Once signed in securely, the user can view their dashboard, which has services such as announcements and control of a wireless Ingenu unit.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The main verification system in Sign Signature is a convolutional neural network. Instead of simply using an API, we wrote and trained a network ourselves using Tensorflow. This allowed the network to be customized to fit each data pair as closely as possible.</p>\n<p>The iOS and OSX applications were written in native Objective-C, while the web app was created in javascript. </p>\n<p>The two servers handling verification are written in Python, and hosted on a Microsoft Azure instance. These servers also serve as an access point to an Ingenu unit.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Transferring image data from the iOS into the neural network caused a lot of issues, as converting into base64 for transfer originally corrupted the image due to newline characters in the string.</p>\n<p>Hardware we were planning to use was not available and we had to pivot our idea.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>it worked\nlow key weeb background</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>how to make it work</p>\n<h2>What's next for 251 Sine Signature</h2>\n<p>make it work better</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://signsignature.co:8080/static/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://signsignature.co:8080/static/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>signsignature.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["i made it work", "same", "same", "same"]], ["Routine Manager", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I wanted to have something to help me follow a routine in the morning.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows user to create and manage routines, and then go through them, eventually giving results of how well the user followed their routine.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Designed as a standard, lightweight iOS application with Swift.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was basically my first application I had ever created, so just learning how the whole process works and getting around the iOS frameworks and tools was probably the most challenging thing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I built my first app!

On the other hand, two-factor authentications often require expensive technologies. We created an inexpensive two-factor authentication method that is both efficient and secured with publicly available APIs. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We created a website and Chrome extension that combines face and gestures recognitions for two-factor authentication of website logins. Through the webcam, the application compares user's face and identifies the correct user from the application's database.

Unfortunately, we received the wrong hardware and the Emotiv's connection USB was not compatible with the Emotiv. After changing our project into the current idea, we ran into several challenges, mainly when making requests from the client and server. For example, when capturing faces through webcam and sending the images through JavaScripts, we need to first blob the image and set up the correct boundaries. In addition, it was pretty challenging to build an efficient and scalable website server capable of handling all the requests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nginx\">nginx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pop.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">aes</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["T265 Secret Tunnel", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T265 Secret Tunnel \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/385/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The Most Secure Way To Transfer Data</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T265 Secret Tunnel \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/386/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Send Data At Light Speed</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by LiFi and its ability to restrict access to only those within line of sight.

The \"home page\" of the virtual reality screen would be a list of character thumbnails that have been accessed, and the Myo would control a cursor that would select a character to expand details about that character, like a description and list of different series the character appears in, which would show up on the \"back wall\", 180 degrees around from the current view.</p>\n<p>We also decided to include speech recognition as a way to search for other characters in the database.  The \"search page\" can be accessed by turning to the right in the virtual reality sphere, and the user speaks the name of the character they wish to look up.  This essentially performs the same action as clicking on a character in the main page, which queries the Marvel database and also brings up the details of the selected character on the \"back wall\".</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Once we had a clear idea of what we wanted to do, it was obvious that there were four main tasks: the Oculus and environment built in Unity, the Myo gesture control, speech recognition, and the Marvel API.  Since there were four members we each took up a different task and tried to develop as far as we could on our respective APIs independently until we needed input from others.</p>\n<p>Once everyone roughly had each part of the program working independently, we started putting it together, with the Oculus and Unity as the foundation.  We first added Myo gesture controls to the VR environment, to ensure we could navigate around the application, and then added Marvel API support on top of that, rendering the character thumbnails in Unity.  Speech recognition was saved for last, as there were default characters to start the applications and the majority of the functionality was there without it.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges we found was that Oculus recently stopped supporting OSX so the newest version of Unity did not support a lot of the plugins that Oculus used, so we had to downgrade the version of Unity we used on a Macbook.  There was also a slight problem when Microsoft's Speech API always crashed on a Macbook and had to be done on a PC, which only one member of our group had.  We also ran into minor issues as only two members of our group had used C# before, so there was a slight learning curve when programming the Myo and Marvel API.  Along a similar vein, only one member of our group had used Unity before, and almost everybody had to work with Unity at some point or another.</p>\n<p>Overall, we were able to work through the issues by splitting resources, sharing the one PC we had and renting a Surface from the hardware table.  We found that on both PCs it wasn't possible to download the Oculus Runtime environment, so we had to abandon the use of the physical Oculus and run a simulation in Unity.  A lot of the issues with C# and Unity were resolved through a combination of Google and help from mentors, and though we ran into a slight time shortage in the end, we were able to come out with a relatively \ncohesive program.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>learning new software, like C#, Unity, and REST API</li>\n<li>getting the different parts of each individual project to work and coordinate with each other</li>\n<li>being able to work around problems and trouble spots without hitting a roadblock that stops all progress</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>to be flexible with using different kinds of software and different languages we're not used to</li>\n<li>that sometimes things won't work and we have to go with plan B...or C</li>\n<li>approximately 4 hours of sleep over two nights probably isn't the best idea but we'll do it anyway</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for MARVIS</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>getting the full project up and working</li>\n<li>implementing machine learning to make suggestions for characters to look up</li>\n<li>functionality to be able to move the thumbnails around on the screen, allowing the user to organize the database</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-speech</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">marvel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">speech-recognition</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["T75- DoraX", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>What if you could explore, learn, and discover your daily surroundings with no extra effort?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>DoraX is an assistive, iOT backpack, that supplements what you see.

When we got the chance to develop something using the Marvel database, we wanted to make our project as fun and interactive as possible. Each Marvel character has unique abilities and attributes, and we wanted a way to showcase that. Making a card game allows us to tell a story with our cards while highlighting the individual characters. We chose to use the X-Men characters for our project because mutants have clearly defined factions with a large number of people on each side. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Marvel cards is a two-player game (Professor X versus Magneto) where each player has a deck of cards consisting of either X-Men, for Professor X, or members of the Brotherhood of Mutants, for Magneto. Each card has attack and health values, and most have special abilities that activate with various triggers. For example, when Storm is played she creates a lightning storm that damages all enemy characters. The motive of the game is to kill the enemy player with your cards while not being killed yourself. Each character starts with 10 health, a relatively low number that helps facilitate the demo. Players must strategize to play cards that will give them the advantage and choose when to attack the enemy player and when to try to eliminate enemy cards.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We first use the Marvel API to select character data that will be used to populate our database. To access the Marvel API we send HTTP get requests, and read the response JSON query result. Once we get the result we parse out the response in C#. Next, we initiate a connection to a local SQL server we created and load all character information, including a character image, into the database. In Unity we query the same database, though we had make our own access credentials instead of using integrated security. We pull character information out of the database and use that to populate the cards we have. The pictures are converted into texture format and inserted into the cards through a mask. The scripts in Unity contain a ton of game logic that define all the game rules, including who can attack, when they can attack, and how each special effect works. The scripts instantiate particle effects and control the AI who plays the enemy deck. We also handled the cards whose special abilities allow them to \"break\" the rules of the game.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge in parsing out the Marvel API data arose from the fact that some necessary info was only embedded in a detail page reached by a URL embedded in the JSON response. On top of the embedded URL pointing to the wrong page at times, parsing the html file also proved to be time consuming.</p>\n<p>We had minor difficulties creating our database as the iso image we were trying to mount on VMWare wouldn't work. We eventually decided on using a local database, Windows SQL Server 2014. In the script loading information from the API into the database we would use integrated security to connect, but in Unity our connection wouldn't work. We found out that Unity does not allow for access through integrated security so we had to make our own access credentials and connect that way.</p>\n<p>There were a lot of challenges when creating the game logic. Since we gave characters special abilities that allow them to break the game rules, we had to make sure the abilities worked correctly for only those characters and didn't mess up the overall logic. One standout issue was with the AI. It played cards and attacked so fast it was difficult to see what was going on. We wanted to delay AI moves, but in Unity a delay or a wait would pause the entire game, which would mess up our particle effects. We eventually solved this with callbacks and a lot of trial and error.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We got the entire game to work! It looks polished and actually contains all the game logic. We learned a lot about how databases work, and how to connect to a database and send queries from within C# code. We also learned more about how Unity works and how to make a turn-based game against an imaginary opponent. We had a lot of difficulties, but we were able to collaborate and work through all of them.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>See above section.</p>\n<h2>What's next for 272# MarvelCards</h2>\n<p>This was the X-Men version of the game. It would be a lot of fun to add more card packs for different Marvel story lines. For example, we had considered doing Civil War sides with Iron Man versus Captain America, but we had difficulties deciding on the characters for each side. With more time and research we could create team rosters for many different groups. We also would like to add more cards to the X-Men set. We currently have ten for each side, but more cards makes for a more interesting game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">marvel</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["156 Paranoia Keyring", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/254/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Menu</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/255/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>NFC ready to send key</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/258/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>QR code reader on public key</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/257/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>public key read from QR code</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/252/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Public Key List</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/256/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>password booster</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/251/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>password booster example</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/253/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>password booster example</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/456/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>My QR Code</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"156 Paranoia Keyring \u2013 screenshot 10\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/457/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>client homepage</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Computer security is always a big issue. Man in the middle attacks are difficult to stop. You're never really sure who to trust. You want to have encrypted communication using PGP but in order to do so you need to exchange public keys. But there is always a chance someone is snooping, HTTPS is unsafe, public PGP key servers are unsafe. The safest way to exchange public keys is to do it in person. However, writing down the entire public key or typing in the public key is a pain. It takes long, is error prone, and not very feasible if you want to give it to a lot of people. So, we've created a way to make that process faster, easier, and still safe. </p>\n<p>Below is an image of a key signing party where participants are exchanging public keys with each other in person.<br/>\n<img alt=\"alt text\" data-canonical-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/FOSDEM_2008_Key_signing_party.jpg/220px-FOSDEM_2008_Key_signing_party.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--_U7cDm1k--/https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/FOSDEM_2008_Key_signing_party.jpg/220px-FOSDEM_2008_Key_signing_party.jpg\"/> </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using our PC application, the user can generate a QR code for their PGP public key. This QR code can then be scanned by our mobile application and the public key will then be stored in our mobile application. Then to exchange public keys you can either hand over the QR code to the other person so that they can scan it into their phone or you can directly send it to the person via NFC. Once you've gotten the public keys you need from others you can then transfer them back to your computer via our forwarding server. The mobile app will then encrypt and sign the public keys using your public key and private key on your phone. Then it will be sent to our server which then you can use to synchronize the public keys onto your computer. (Currently, synchronization is implemented but the encrypted transfer is in development). So, as you can see by using the QR code and NFC a man in the middle attack is not possible. It also makes direct exchanges much less painful and easy since all you need to do is scan a QR code or tap your phone with the other person's phone. It's fast, easy, and safe. </p>\n<h2>Extra Features</h2>\n<p>We also added an extra feature called Password Booster which basically gauges the strength of the password you input then outputs a stronger password. Many users have a hard time thinking up of strong passwords and they don't want just completely random passwords, so this feature will give them passwords that are variations of what they input. </p>\n<p>Password Booster first evaluates the strength of your current password. In assigning it a score it uses basic criteria such as length and the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols like @. At the same time, it takes a deeper look and deducts points for certain negative characteristics. Passwords that consist of only letters or only numbers are penalized the most, but there are also penalties for numerous repeated instances of the same symbol, long strings of symbols of the same type, and long strings of sequential symbols (e.g. 123). </p>\n<p>The user sets a score threshold, and if the original password doesn't meet this requirement, Password Booster will try to augment it until it does. It's primary tools for doing so are adding strings of words, numbers, and symbols to the password. In addition, because dictionary words are among the easiest passwords to crack, all letters in the password are considered to either randomly have its case change (e.g. lower to upper) or to have it be changed to its l33t speak equivalent, if applicable (e.g. E to 3). Added strings can be inserted anywhere in the password, potentially breaking up existing clear dictionary words. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed an Android application using Android Studio and Java; we used ZXing's barcode scanner for scanning QR codes. We store the PGP keys internally on the phone whenever we scan a QR code or receive via NFC. The user can access all keys that were saved, choose which one to send to another user, and even delete keys they don't want anymore. The only time the application connects to the internet is when the public keys are synchronized with the user's computer. We use HTTPS to connect to the server and the public keys that are sent to the server are stored in a private storage for each user. Currently we are still in development of encrypting the public keys and signing them before they are sent, which would make the system secure even if the server was malicious. The server and Windows/Linux client are written in Python; the UI for the client is written HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. We also supplemented our client code with bash scripts. The client also has the Password Booster identical to the one found on the Android application. The Password Booster is written in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap and is displayed as a native WebView on the Android application. So, even then the application does not connect to the internet. The Bootstrap library is also locally existent on the application so that it doesn't have to be acquired from the web. </p>\n<h2>Development Environment and Tools</h2>\n<p>We used Windows 10 as our main development environment to run Android Studio and virtual machines to run Linux. We also used Office Live for collaborative documents and OneDrive for sharing. We used Visual Studios as our main IDE for Javascript, HTML/CSS, and Python. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we generated binary PGP QR codes and when it was read into the mobile application it was encoded in UTF-8 which effectively scrambled the data. We had trouble converting it back to its original state and so we spent hours trying to figure this out. In the end we changed the way we generated the QR codes and so instead we did ASCII PGP QR codes which solved the problem immediately.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We used 4 different programming languages (Java, Javascript, Python, and Bash) making programs that work across 3 different operating systems (Android, Windows, and GNU/Linux) </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use NFC in our application for the first time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Paranoia Keyring</h2>\n<p>Password Booster makes heavy use of randomness in deciding what to insert/modify and where to do it. While random passwords are the most secure, they are also the most difficult to remember. Future improvements would involve the program keeping in mind exactly what caused an original password to fail to meet the threshold, so that it can specifically target these issues. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nfc\">nfc</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">qr-code</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitbucket\">bitbucket</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/JoL07/la-hacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/JoL07/la-hacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android application's UI and UX design as well as the Public Key QR Code Reader, part of the NFC transfer functionality, reading/writing PGP keys in internal memory, and applying Bootstrap classes to front-end HTML/CSS code.", "I was primarily responsible for the Password Booster functionality, evaluating and augmenting the strength of given passwords.

While brainstorming for Ideas, one of us started to talk about blind people and thats how we built upon that idea concerning the blind and decided that we would create a mobile application that would assist them in understanding and being aware of their surrounding at all times. Nowadays, you could find big data on the cloud so why don't use them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It help blind people in their daily life by acting like theirs eyes. It takes pictures from the phone's front camera at a set frequency and constantly sends it to our server, which analyzes the pictures and sends back JSON objects. The server would send only one JSON object per 5 pictures (2 x 5 = 10 seconds in all) taken, in response to the best image (response rate - async - 1 response per 6 seconds). This Jason object includes names of things that were recognized in the image and also a message that describes the image briefly. Only the most \"confident\" elements of the set of pictures will be return. The application uses this data to give a speech response.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The android application was built using java in Android Studio. Third party libraries were used to ease the programming process. Retrofit was used to sent the captured jpeg images over http. Socket.io was used to establish a socket between the server and the phone. Transmission of JSON was done over the Socket. The server was built upon the Heroku framework in addition to nodeJS. MongoDB was also used to store temporary information about the same images. Lastly, Microsoft Cognitive Service Api was used to incorporate machine learning. Specifically, the computer vision api was used to detect objects and one's surroundings.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>In developing Uaware, there were big challenges in programming the camera to work in the right fashion without user interaction. Additionally, sending/recieving the right data between client and server(images, json, and socket establishments) brought along several issues that affected the performance and usability of this application. However, through testing and iterations, these problems have been fixed. Lastly, a small challenge that we recently noticed is the limit imposed by Microsofts Cognitive Services Api Calls. In trying to improve accuracy, we noticed that the Api service would block our requests because of the high number of them. This is the only trade off regarding performance and accuracy.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team is proud of ironing out all the bugs that prevented the app from working correctly. Socket.IO and heroku together are known not to work well with each other. And simply proud to have developed an helpful app for disabled people. However, we still managed to make some changes to the configuration and have everything working smoothly.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that with a good team, anything can be made as long as there is a solid goal. The innovation in technology in the Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles can be used to improve the life of everyone and it is important for the students and younger generations to take part in creating what previously was thought to be the impossible. We all three learned many things from Socket.IO to Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for T7 Uaware</h2>\n<p>T7 has already planed its future. We would love to share with the open community all the lines of codes that we wrote during this amazing hackaton. The code will be released on GitHub after we would have cleaned it.

Other people can then \"uplift\" a post if they find it uplifting.  Users can sort posts on their feed by most recent or most \"uplifted.\"</p>\n<p>As a post gets more uplifts, it rises to the top of the local \"most uplifted\" feed, thus getting exposure to more users.  It also rises up on users' regional and global feeds.  Thus, the end goal of the most uplifting posts is that they will appear at the top of the global feed.</p>\n<p>Every time a user's post is uplifted by someone else, that user's account receives a small amount of money that they can donate to a charity of their choice.  The money for this will be raised with banner ads which appear between posts on a user's feed.</p>\n<h2>LA HACKS JUDGES: A Note About the User Interface</h2>\n<p>Please note that for this app, we used user interface libraries that had already been created in the past by one of our coders on some of his previous projects.  Therefore, the hack that we embarked upon in LA Hacks was the application of these libraries to a social network and setting up our server and cloud functions.</p>\n<p>We mention this to ensure that we are abiding by the official rules stating that teams must begin their hacks at the competition.  To be fair to the other teams, please judge our app based on the server integration and application of the user interface to the new social network, not the user interface itself.  Treat the user interface like any other 3rd party API that hackers are using in this competition (just, in this case, we're the ones who made said API in the past).</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">parse-server</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mlab</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the team on coming up with the main idea, and the we all branched off.

Vohab continuously tracks and calculates user word frequency and tone data from a Raspberry Pi (our wearable) and Microsoft's Cognitive Services API suite. Users can view a history of their \"vohabulary\" (user speech analysis highlighting periodic word frequency, tone analysis, and even swear counts) on our website <a href=\"http://www.vohab.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.vohab.co</a>!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Raspberry Pi handles audio input using the Python library, PyAudio. Through clever aggregation of multiple samples, we minimize the number of API calls necessary for our application to make. We call Microsoft Cognitive Services API to get speech analysis metrics, and then send data to our MongoDB database. We have the domain from the .co company, and host our website on Azure. We then use jQuery to send data and sync the user's dashboard with c3 charting tools to visualize speech metrics.</p>\n<p>We were combining lots of different paradigms in this project. Low level raspberry pi sending REST API calls. Integrating cognitive services into intuitive charts and graphs.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Biggest challenges included taking detours that we now know set us back, time-wise. Choosing the right database and hosting relationship took us from Azure and SQL to Amazon Web Services and MongoDB, to finally sticking with Azure and MongoDB. We were so lucky to be able to work with patient Microsoft technical evangelists to work through our bugs and to learn how best to integrate our design choices.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p><strong>Unique social and technical application</strong>\nIn deciding which hardware to use to track user data, we felt that no existing wearables truly fit the form and function of the Vohab functionality. Instead of settling with any of the existing wearable technologies and adapting our idea to its particular hardware limitations (microphone, access to API calls, compatibility with software), we made the decision to work with the Raspberry Pi.</p>\n<p><strong>UI/UX research and planning</strong>\nWhat we learned from a really insightful UI/UX workshop led by Jose Caballer Saturday morning was the importance of developing key customer profiles before even touching code. After learning about the importance of identifying the user demographics and psychographics, our team sat down and discussed the functionality that would be necessary to serve the user's wants and needs. This early planning made our end product goal clear throughout the weekend, and this helped us manage our efforts working on higher-priority components of Vohab that best served the user.</p>\n<p>From this planning, we've learned that there shouldn't be too much work involved in figuring <em>what</em> to say during a product pitch because your UI/UX research should primarily inform you of that from the beginning. The end of product implementation should be a time for teams to learn <em>how</em> to best communicate their product vision and application to the user and market.</p>\n<p><strong>Our team</strong>\nWe call ourselves Team (4-3-2-1) Lift-Off. But why is that? Our team is particularly unique because we are comprised of two USC students and two UCLA students, one freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior. Through our hacking this weekend, we've demonstrated the value of collaboration beyond school rivalries and the importance of innovating for the sake of solving real world problems. We delegated work based on skillsets and interests and this kept everyone engaged and feeling valued.</p>\n<p>What might come across as surprising is that our team met each other for the first time here at LA Hacks! Over the last day and a half, our group dynamic and communication efforts have only improved, and we've all enjoyed working on Vohab with a similar drive and motivation. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We've learned a lot from our weekend at LA Hacks (donuts are great, sleeping in basketball arenas can be comfortable...). A few things we've learned include the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In a time crunch and a high-pressure low-time setting such as a hackathon, it's important to choose the shortest path to final implementation possible, for sake of completion and sanity. What we really appreciated and enjoyed doing was walking around and speaking with sponsors before even sitting down to decide what to make. By asking sponsors for their advice and their experiences, our team was more aware of what technical guidance we could receive from which individuals at this event. What we found as worked on our project was that Azure is difficult to work with as first-time users, and we struggled because of this.</p></li>\n<li><p>Refactoring is possible to do at hackathons. We implemented a script that only recorded from the Raspberry Pi when it picked up loud enough amplitudes which was awesome, but was even more awesome was our team's willingness to make that recording process even more efficient by signaling the end of a recording through amplitude decrease.</p></li>\n<li><p>It's okay to save implementation for future thoughts. Which leads us to...</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for Vohab</h2>\n<p>\"Vohabulary\" complexity, synonym recommendations for most frequently used words, collaboration between users and ability to share their \"vohabulary\" analytics, voice isolation recognition, conversation topics.</p>\n<p>We want to solidify on the technologies we used. We believe our greatest strength is utilizing the unique experiences each tool provides. We want to explore how else we can captivate potential users, and helping everyone see the benefit of better dictation</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cognitive-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.vohab.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.vohab.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.vohab.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on UI/UX design for the vohab.co platform, managed jQuery requests and learned a lot about routes and controllers in MongoDB!", "Developed the software for quickly and efficiently recording and encoding audio to be processed.

In the application, the user can record sessions of their own stories using pre-made, animated characters. These characters are hand-drawn, 2D images that also have a 3D model component displayed digitally. These stories are recorded and saved to \"Scenes\", where the user can rewatch them. The video is consisted of moving 3D objects (imitating user's character movements with AR technologies), audio, and a selection of backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Throughout the two days, our team collaborated to make different components using Unity Engine and Vuforia, an AR plug-in. Recording the video and audio is an incredibly hard challenge, as there is no existing unity plug-in or library to support that functionality. Therefore, we have to come up with a new solution that generates the same result. We \"hacked\" it by recording the position and orientation of tracked models and replace them into the scene with an added 2D background. The audios are dynamically linked after the process of recording. On the side of UI/UX design, all of our characters are hand-drawn and some of our models have animations. One of our teammates also paper-prototyped the whole mobile application before we code, did beautiful artworks for logos and banners through Illustrator, and so on.</p>\n<p>We learned so much from the past two days.

As two college students who frequently found ourselves lingering around restaurants sorting out I-O-U's and what's-your-Venmo and wait-how-much-again, we wanted to create a seamless and efficient experience for dividing the tab.</p>\n<h2>WHAT IT DOES</h2>\n<p>Simply take a picture of the receipt (or enter in prices manually), link items to individuals, and the app will do all of the heavy-lifting.</p>\n<h2>THE CREATIVE PROCESS</h2>\n<p>Our first challenge was figuring out the most efficient way for a user to split a tab \u2013 we sought to build an app that would lead the user from start to finish in the fewest amount of clicks. While we wanted to provide the option for customization (whether in nicknames of the people splitting the bills or in the names of the items themselves), we decided that most users in a rush would want to just immediately enter in prices.</p>\n<p>As a humble team of two \u2013 neither of whom have front-end mobile application experience \u2013 we had to make some compromises. Since neither of us were familiar with Swift, we focused on the interface prototype and the backend development of the app. Graphic assets and mockups were built in Adobe Illustrator and Sketch, then later imported into Keynote for the prototype and demo. On the backend, we incorporated OCR technology by using Tesseract, which is an open source learning engine that can recognize characters from images. We use this technology to process receipts for convenient use of the app without having to enter every single item. </p>\n<h2>NEXT STEPS</h2>\n<p>We're hoping to continue <strong>EVEN</strong> beyond LA Hacks. In the upcoming months, we'll have to familiarize ourselves with Swift, as well as continue refining the user experience and interface.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/keynote\">keynote</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tesseract\">tesseract</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hyang97/Even\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hyang97/Even\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["T33 Dark Seid of the Moon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Love for music. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Converts a .wav file to a visual format, via python and a fast Fourier transform. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using python and various python libraries.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>That this program actually works and does something non-trivial.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Basics of digital signal processing, how audio files are stored digitally.</p>\n<h2>What's next for T33 Dark Seid of the Moon</h2>\n<p>Comparing different songs of the same genre, creating musical filters that can then be overlayed on other songs. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sci</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scipy\">scipy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">matplotlib</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gsuresh97/darkseidofthemoon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gsuresh97/darkseidofthemoon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Marvel Me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marvel Me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/506/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Character Selection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marvel Me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/507/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Character Moves</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to create a complete app using a variety of technologies.

It allowed users to create tasks, and earn gold + exp for finishing tasks and keeping good habits, while penalizing them for bad habits and incomplete tasks. However, everything had to be manually managed by the user (they had to add their own tasks and check them off), making it somewhat inconvenient for the user. It was also very easy to cheat; users can just make random tasks and mark them off as complete, gaining gold and exp without doing anything.</p>\n<p>We also wanted to find a way to motivate people to exercise, and one of our team members had a FitBit, so we decide to gamify and encourage fitness by using the FitBit API and have the user exercise to earn gold.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web app allows the user to have fun and motivate people to exercise. We use the FitBit API to gather data from the user's FitBit, and award coins to them based on the number of steps you take in a day. Since it's based on data pulled from the cloud, it's a lot harder to cheat than HabitRPG's application. Using these coins, the user can then buy weapons and armor, and fight increasingly difficult monsters. Defeating monsters will grant the user EXP they can use to level up and get even more powerful. We want the game to be addicting so that people will be motivated to exercise more to get their character stronger.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this web app with FitBit's API, Node, React, and Bootstrap. We integrated our game seamlessly with FitBit by polling their API the activity information of our users. After getting each user's exercising progress, the game smoothly updates the user profile's coins to enhance the in-game experience. We control the communication between the client's browser display and our server using jQuery HTTP Ajax requests and responses, which dynamically updates the client display with the most up-to-date information of their profile and progress in the game.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>On the backend, we figured out how to authenticate users and fetch data from the Fitbit API. \nOn the front end, we learned how to set up Babel and Webpack to write React.js in es6 on the server side. After writing the views in React, We had some troubling integrate the game which is developed with jQuery into the React data flow. At last we managed to find a workaround. We also learned about resolving the CSS intricacies with new techniques from CSS3.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>From a technology perspective, we learned how to use front end technology React.js, and how to integrate it with jQuery from the back end. We also learned how to integrate FitBit's API with our project to get data from the cloud. From a team experience perspective, we learned how people within team can work separately on front end and back end, and integrate them smartly.</p>\n<h2>What's next for T253 FitRPG: Gamify your fitness experience!</h2>\n<p>We will try to make the gameplay even more fun, by adding spells, pets, and other things.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">fitbit-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://fitrpg2.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fitrpg2.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>fitrpg2.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["T#219 Olympic BPM", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T#219 Olympic BPM \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/575/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"T#219 Olympic BPM \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/576/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The Olympics is a globally recognized event that captures the attention of people all over the world. It is a time where countries all over the planet compete to gain national pride. Seeing as Los Angeles will be bidding for the 2024 Olympics, we really wanted to show all the visitors and guests (whether it be on the television or in person) that LA is a city of innovation, progressive change and creativity. Therefore, we wanted to bring bring an interactive experience to the Olympic game audiences as well as viewers at home. In the stadiums, we give each audience member a microsoft band (or another fitness band) and measure their heartrate and movements throughout the event using sensors in the band. Through these measurements, we want to visually display the excitement of the crowd by lighting up their seat with color. These colors correspond to how excited the audience member is. This means that the entire stadium will light up with the audience reaction. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A Microsoft band provides the heartrate, gyroscope and accelerometer measurements. We can use these measurements to determine how excited the audience is and then the seats will correspondingly light up with a specific color. Additionally, the movement of the audience member (like fist pumps) will be measured by the band and the lights will flicker corresponding to the fist pump movement. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a microsoft band to gather data, programmed the arduino to control the LED light strip on the chair and also wrote a short IOS app for the audience/at home audience to view the LIVE heartrate data of the live spectators. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Porting the information off of the microsoft band via bluetooth turned out to be a huge problem. We did not have time to fix all the bugs necessary to integrate all the components. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We think that the experience as a whole was a great idea. We constantly came up with ways to improve or add on to the current features. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to write our first IOS app and learned about the difficulty of integrating components that run on different types of code. Also, we definitely learned a lesson about time management as we felt like we were a bit rushed to the finish. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Olympic BPM</h2>\n<p>We definitely didn't have enough time to integrate each individual piece of the experience (integrating the microsoft band to the arduino and our light strips). Additionally, we would like to work on further developing our IOS app and more at home audience interaction. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Winston's Pretty Much Dead", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Winston's Pretty Much Dead \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/607/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everybody in our team loves games and entertainment. There's nothing as addictive as jamming buttons and trying to beat a stressfully annoying game for a high score. So, we figured, why not have a game which picks up on our emotions and uses them as feedback to customize an entertainment experience? </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The game is fairly simple and is a proof of concept for how a biosensory iOS game would work. The goal of the game is to kill the creepy spiders descending down from the top of the screen onto poor Winston, who's trapped on the floor,.  As you swipe away the spiders, a Microsoft band across your wrist will be tracking your heart rate in real time and displaying this information as you play, letting you know how calm you are. Your high score will be a combination of your success in keeping Winston healthy by killing spiders and how \"calm\" you were, or how low you were able to keep your heart rate from deviating from its resting rate.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our team built this game by primarily using the Unity game engine and C#. The heart rate information was accessed by the iOS application using the Microsoft Band API and processed in an Objective C based application.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our initial backend framework for obtaining heart rate data was written in Swift, but we later discovered Unity can only export an iOS project in Objective C. Thus a large amount our efforts went into converting the Swift code to Objective C. Additionally, learning and troubleshooting Unity was a challenge as it was a new technology to all of us and builds often took long periods of time. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of learning Unity overnight and building an iOS game, as well as being able to build a project in languages we had very little to no prior experience with. We are also proud of how calm we were able to remain while watching horror movie trailers to calibrate the device. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we learned how to use several new technologies (Unity, Objective C, Microsoft Band). Also, this was our first Hackathon, so we learned how to work together, be resourceful and work with both front end and back ends. We learned how to optimize amount of swag obtained vs free time not spent hacking, and most of all, we learned how to dive into something completely new for all of us. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Winston's Pretty Much Dead</h2>\n<p>This is the most exciting area for us. With this game, we hoped to show that incorporating biometric measurements can enhance an entertainment experience. Within games, the next step would be to build a suite of games that don't simply use heart rate as a means of scoring, but react. For example, how cool would it be to have a game that adjusts its soundtrack or its mechanics when you're in a state of paranoia (high heart rate, blood pressure) to create an experience customized to your body and mind? </p>\n<p>Additionally, an idea we had that we didn't have time to implement was to use heart rate sensing to enhance movie and live event experiences. For example, by gathering heart rate data of a crowd watching the Olympics or a horror movie fan at the theaters, it could be possible to create a highlight reel customized to the viewer of what was most exciting, and use the data to predict which athlete, movie or event the user would most be excited by. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["This is the first time I work on Unity.

We hacked the keyboard to retrofit them with these really cool 2812 b RGB LEDs. On the software part, we used JavaScript for most part of the coding, using Electron for developing the cross platform Desktop Application, Python backend for the services. And the hardware consists only of an Arduino flashed with a modified version of Firmata to control the LEDs and MIDI port of the keyboard for communicating keypress/feedback from the keyboard.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Lots of Soldering, Resoldering and lot more of it, Oh boy, What a hackthon this was:P\nWe had issues with the mode we communicated with the arduino for turning on the huge strip of LEDs that we created, this caused a lot of issues in terms of the minium Frame Rate constraining to about 50 ms and that had to be handling really ingeniously using the software we developed.\nAnd Ofcourse the immense attention that we recieved( It was the most fun device out here after all) </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We finished what we aimed at and came out with our first prototype within our goal time.

In these areas, it is imperative to save water, but consumers only see their water usage every two months when they get their water bill. drip is designed to close this feedback loop by allowing users to see their water usage after every shower.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>drip is a smart water meter that monitors water flow through your shower, and beams the data to your smartphone. From our easy to use app, users can see their current water usage, their history, compete with friends for lower water usage, and earn achievements by saving water. This is all achieved while never requiring a user to charge it or change a battery, because it generates its own power from the water flowing through it. After the 1 minute installation, drip never needs to be touched again.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>drip's housing was created by a 3D printer designed on 123D Design. This houses circuity we built over the past two days which computes shower length and sends the data to our AWS server. We also created an iOS app in Swift which pulls user data and displays it in a lovely fashion.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Hardware always presents unique challenges when working at a hackathon. Because we did not start ahead of time, we ran into many issues of needing more hardware than we expected. For instance, we needed an op amp to invert a voltage, an external battery to power the op amp, and many more problems. In addition, the 3D printer stopped working right before we started printing, so we had to issue commands to it in assembly code instead of using its cloud interface.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Every team member is proud of the work we did this weekend. In under 30 hours, we designed and implemented a complete product, including building the casing, creating the circuitry, designing a website, setting up the back-end server, and implementing an iOS app. There is nothing more we wish we could have done, and we are proud to call drip ours.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This weekend has taught us all an incredible amount.

Once we obtained this, we were able to tap into the data that was sent from the Melon headset to our android mobile device. We transmitted this data to a firebase server for temporary storage. On the other hand, we used the Kinect SDK to perform speech recognition in C#. We stream the Melon EEG data from our web server, and finally use all available data to influence events on our computer such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, window changes, etc. An interface with a low level functions allows us to directly make keystrokes via software.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Melon EEG SDK was not publicly available and was very hard to find online.\nCalibrating the Melon and training for it was also very challenging.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Having the entire system work together was very rewarding.\nIt was a very unique experience controlling aspects of the computer with just your mind and assistance from your voice. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to make an android application that interfaces with the Melon.

We wanted to build something more affordable for people to use.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our idea was to create a cheap water filtration system that could connect to the Could and give information about how much water is being filtered and the status of the filtered water. By keeping track of this information, we could prevent water contamination and keep track of the efficiency of the filtration device. This project is small for the scope of LA hacks but can be scaled up. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used a 3-D Printer to create the chamber and an Arduino to control the pump and the sensors. We also used diatomaceous earth and a mesh filter to filter out the water and </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many challenges. We had very little experience going into the competition and had to use makeshift parts that were unwieldy. Furthermore, we tried to 3-D Print the base of our water purification chamber, but it took 3 tries with the resin printer to actually get a usable product (even this was filled with holes). </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of us putting together something within our limited time and experience. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about web design, implementation of arduino and arduino sensor, specifically with water sensor. We also learned how to utilize mechanical data from water filtration system into digital website. We managed to make a prototype in an almost no resource provided environment by utilizing items such as bottle caps and water bottles.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Water Filter</h2>\n<p>If we were to continue developing our project, we would want to improve the database to give detailed information and research more ways to purify water and get the best quality for the price. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["126 CrowdFoods", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"126 CrowdFoods \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/442/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the hunger in the world. If you've ever tried to plan a party or feed a crowd, you know that it requires a lot of planning and organization. This web app makes your life easier.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web app lets you create food funds as well as contribute to them. One food fund is simply that- you can request for food from a business to be delivered to any location covered by Postmates and people worldwide can contribute to the fund. The web app puts your fund online, and once the goal is reached, it places an order with Postmates and gets your food delivered.  We built this website mainly to be used for charitable work, making it easy for anyone to donate to homeless shelters or volunteering events.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built its backend using Tornado in Python, and made use of the Postmates API and materialize.css. We hosted the site on Microsoft Azure using a pop.co domain.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a challenge with deploying the web app to Azure because we couldn't figure out how to run Python scripts on Azure. We figured this out after asking Microsoft for help.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>School work never really striked us as \"real world\" applications of code. We are proud that today, we put what we know into an application that can benefit the world. Not only did we experience a huge amount of technical growth (learning about tornado, azure, etc), but also personal growth (dealing with deadlines, not sleeping, etc).</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>It was a enlightening experience where we learned so much about full stack development. Prior to this, frontend and backend were two separate things to us, but after working on CrowdFoods, we finally understand the importance of fullstack developers. </p>\n<h2>What's next for 126 CrowdFoods</h2>\n<p>Polishing, testing, and deploying. After fixing up some bugs and completion of key features, we would like to begin beta testing in the real world (release it at a university). After initial testing and feedback, we will once again polish the app, repeating the process until perfection (or until it's ready to be released to the public).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tornado\">tornado</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postmates\">postmates</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bigdata</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.crowdfoods.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.crowdfoods.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.crowdfoods.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Frontend, some backend", "", ""]], ["KibbleCount", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"KibbleCount \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/635/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>KibbleCount Logo.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"KibbleCount \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/638/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our dainty home screen, you can scroll down to read about us and our team.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"KibbleCount \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/664/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Choose your items!

Most of the time we have been great at deciphering other people's emotional reactions to what we do and say, but sometimes (which almost seems to be on a date) we aren't that great at reading people's reactions. To help us to be more sympathetic and aware of other people's feelings towards us, we have discovered that microemotions can help us uncover the hidden emotions that we didn't see before and help us create longer lasting relationships. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Microemotion's purpose is to bring people together by providing them a compatibility rating. This compatibility rating is determined by taking emotional values from a series of webcam pictures of the user as they are reading a list of responses from a person of interest. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Microsoft's Emotions API as well as Node.js for server-side communication and Firebase for a temporary database for storing pictures. First, we uploaded the 3 URI's of the images that the webcam took for each question to Firebase. Then after compressing it, we process the images with the Emotions API and get an average emotion reading to determine the emotion most closely associated with the corresponding question/response. Afterwards we use all of the emotional reactions to each questions to determine a compatability rating for the user with respect to the other person's response. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into some issues dealing with converting our webcam images into URI's and creating a suitable data-structure in Firebase to store all of them. The biggest challenge for us was/is compressing the URI's to a link short enough for node to process and pass into the Emotion API.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the collaborative effort for coming up for the idea as well as the teamwork in implementing the hack. One of us is a first time hacker/just learning web dev and was able to build all of the front-end website for us. The rest of us have never worked with image uploading/displaying, databases, React, or node thus we are very proud of ourselves to be able to learn all of these libraries and features in a short amount of time (all the while studying for midterms!)</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to use backend with Firebase and Node.js as well as breaking up a complex project into more manageable parts for each team member to build. We also learned to (whenever possible) try to keep it as simple as possible. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Microemotions</h2>\n<p>Live webcam emotions feedback: in other words, users can have a live webcam chat with another person and Microemotions can give users instant feedback about the other person's feelings towards you. Another feature would use big data collected over the lifetime of the user to give users tips to help them be more cognizant of some of their not so great personality traits as well as steps to improve their sociability.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ninaling/microemotions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ninaling/microemotions\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the client-side to use the webcam to send pictures to firebase and pass a compressed URL to node.js to use the emotions API.

MarvelU is the latest and greatest application for comic fans and non fans alike as you and your friends have hours of fun taking turns seeing which Marvel character you get.</p>\n<p>Just take a picture with your iPhone.  Using Microsoft's Cognitive Services, the application determines various features of your face, and generates a data profile of you.  Next it utilizes Disney Marvel's API's vast collection of comic characters to determine which one best suits you!  Incorporated UI to maintain the retro and cartoon feel of Marvel comics.</p>\n<p>MarvelU will tell you its confidence in its selection.  With a high confidence percentage, maybe it's a sign that you could be the star of Marvel's next Superhero film.  Don't lose out on this amazing opportunity.

We ran into issues filtering Marvel characters by gender, specifically female characters appeared less often and many other characters in the Marvel database were invalid (missing essential pieces of info).</p>\n<h2>What's next for MarvelU</h2>\n<p>We can try to more accurately find the facial similarities between the user and Marvel characters.

While it helped to keep us awake, and while it was a great playlist, it didn't fit the mood or the time of day, and we didn't really like it. We thought there had to be a better way to play music that everyone liked and wanted to hear at the time, rather than playing music straight from a playlist.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users search for a song which runs through the Youtube Search API. The top search result is returned and a thumbnail is shown, as well as its current number of votes. This is added to the playlist where other users can vote up or down. Songs with the highest upvotes are pushed to the top of the list while songs with the most downvotes are left at the bottom. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We utilized Meteor to create our web app and used the Youtube API to integrate Youtube Search and the player into the page.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were all fairly new to javascript and ran into issues with executing what we envisioned. In using Meteor, which we were all unfamiliar with, we were confused, and often switched back and forth between different platforms, trying to determine the best way of actually creating our idea. Also, we had issues integrating the Youtube API into our web app; however, there was a large amount of Google Developer documentation that offered support and answered many of our questions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Though the capacity of users is currently limited, and there a few bugs here and there, we are happy to have created a web app that not only solves our original problem, but is also functional, intuitive, and easy to use. Furthermore, we're proud of our main programmer, Ray, for pushing through endless hours to understand and write the logic, to improve functionality, and to enhance design.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned it is best to use frameworks that we understand rather than relying on what services are provided for us through platforms because it becomes hard to manipulate to its full capacity when we don't have basic information. Also, some of our first time hackers on the team learned how to take bits and pieces from different APIs and services and put it together to create what we envision.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MassDeck</h2>\n<p>We hope to add certain to allow greater functionality, such velocity limiting for song submission, velocity limiting for voting, and user accounts. We would also like to allow users to have it synced across multiple pages. Furthermore, we hope to incorporate different types of media, not just Youtube videos.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/youtube\">youtube</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://massdeck.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://massdeck.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>massdeck.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["T91 UC Battle", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>UC Battle is a multiple player game that allows you to choose one school out of the 9 UC schools (along with USC) and battle out with your friend!

We had difficulties with detecting hit boxes and collision in relation to the models and environment.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Building the whole game our self excluding Java and OpenGL. We built the whole game engine ourselves and it includes custom model loading and texture loading. Our engine includes our own rendering ending as well as physics and lighting engine. We better utilized 3D math and matrices for use in the physics engine.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How difficult it truly is to create a fully-fledged game is 36 hours. We learned what it takes to create one's own game engine including all the mechanics and inner-workings of the engine/library. We learned how to better create 3D models and their related textures with UV mapping. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Truck Game</h2>\n<p>A fully-fledged game engine with a complete physics engine. We would like to implement a multiplayer networking system. We would like to improve out lighting engine (deferred lighting). We would like to add a particle system. We would like to make our game engine possible to run on many different platforms using OpenGLES (mobile, web, pc).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opengl\">opengl</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Helped with creating models and coming up with the idea.", "I helped code the physics engine and designing/creating some of the models and textures.", "I worked with the graphical back-end of the the game engine with the shaders and model loading, etc. I also managed the core of the game engine.", "We helped model the objects in the game.

We saw Amazon's new Alexa software had become open to third parties, so we decided to do a hack with it running off a raspberry pi. Given the fact that this hackathon is taking place at UCLA, we decided to do something Bruin-themed with Alexa. We hope our hack can serve as an example of the exciting possibilities of taking everyday objects like a stuffed animal and animating it with intelligence.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Joe Bruin runs an open source version of Alexa on a Raspberry Pi with two custom-built Alexa skills (both based off of example skills from <a href=\"https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js</a>, namely the Reindeer Games and Hello World skills). But in addition to these custom UCLA skills, Joe Bruin will talk to you about the weather, tell you a joke, or perform one of the many other build in Alexa functions.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We performed open heart surgery on the bear, cramming a Raspberry Pi into teddy bear along with a 3.5 mm jack speaker and USB microphone for Alexa's I/O capabilities. We initially tried to cannibalize the bears original speakers, but after that effort was unsuccessful, we decided to just use the bear's built in LED. We used AWS SDK to modify the examples skills we found on Github and tailor them to be UCLA themed. Once the hardware was hooked up, we were able to create skills and intents through online voice services.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we faced</h2>\n<p>One challenge we faced was trying to do a hardware-intensive project at a mainly software hackathon using mostly things we found at a grocery store!! We did not bring all of the necessary tools to realize our vision for the talking teddy, so we struggled to find the right equipment for a long time. We were new to both the Amazon Skills Kit and the Raspberry Pi system, so our greatest challenge was familiarizing ourselves with these new interfaces and ensuring that they worked together correctly.</p>\n<h2>Use Cases</h2>\n<p>We believe that Joe Bruin serves as an exciting demonstration of the opportunities of third party development with Alexa. With Amazon's ASK, Alexa is extremely customizable - Joe could be turned into an assistant for any computable operation you can imagine, from a child's toy to an office personal assistant. An important difference between Joe Bruin and Amazon's Echo is price - while both perform similar functionality, with the Raspberry Pi, a working Alexa assistant could be easily made for under $40.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Robbie Page Brand", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Robbie Page Brand \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/691/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Design and Build a strong brand with great design!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Robbie Page Brand</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.robbiepage.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.robbiepage.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.robbiepage.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["p2p-infinite", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"p2p-infinite \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/382/789/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>logo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Dropbox recently launched Project Infinite. The new service allows the users to securely access all files in their remote Dropbox seamlessly, regardless of their actual local storage capacity. Finding this idea interesting, I decided to build a p2p file sharing network based on this concept.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>p2p-infinite is literally the combination of Google Drive and Dropbox Infinite. It is beneficial to corporations that have a secure internal network and do not want to use external services like Google Drive. The software allows the corporations to cut down storage space and levers the power of secure data transportation inside a p2p network. </p>\n<p>Inside the p2p network, each machine will hold be responsible for storing a certain portion of files locally. This prevents the need to duplicate files in all the machines. With p2p-infinite, a user can view all the share files in the shared folder, but every file will occupy 0KB. The system will sync the file from its peers when the user attempts to access the file. The syncing will be completed in a split second just as the files were stored locally. Once the users have finished editing the file, the system will sync the database back to its original machine that holds the file, so the files are always updated in the network. The file will be reduced to 0KB after the user closes the file. In addition, the system allows multiple users to access the same file simultaneously - just like the service Google Doc offers. </p>\n<h2>What's next for p2p-infinite</h2>\n<p>The current version of p2p-infinite is a MVP of the whole concept. I hope to continue to work on this project and open source it to make file sharing and syncing inside a company easier than ever before. Additional features that can be included in the future are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>file compression and decompression</li>\n<li>data encryption</li>\n<li>smarter algorithm for distributing files</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vic317yeh/p2p-infinite\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/vic317yeh/p2p-infinite\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]]]
