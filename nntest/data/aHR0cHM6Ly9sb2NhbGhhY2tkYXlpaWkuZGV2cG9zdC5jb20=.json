All week I've been working on reverse engineering its Bluetooth LE API, and after finally making a breakthrough this Local Hack Day, I decided to make a demo with the JavaScript module I created!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>When you send a URL in an SMS to the number, Nexmo calls a webhook running on my laptop via ngrok. That then calls my <a href=\"https://github.com/sprusr/muki.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muki.js</a> module, which converts the image at the URL to a format compatible with the Muki. This was <em>easily</em> the most difficult part.</p>\n<p>The app then sends the image to the Muki using the module. It connects via Bluetooth Low Energy and sends a start command, followed by the image data, followed by a stop command.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The Muki is powered by differential heat between the outside of the mug and the liquid inside it. After a while, the outside of the mug heats up and it loses its power. This is quite annoying when you're testing code which needs to connect to the mug in order to run. On average the mug lasts about 15 minutes. Very annoying.</p>\n<h1>What's next</h1>\n<p>There are a few bugs with the Muki.js module that I need to sort out. Particularly the bug where you can only send a new image once per time the Node app is run. I encourage you to buy a Muki and submit PRs!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nexmo\">nexmo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muki</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sprusr/muki-sms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sprusr/muki-sms\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did it all, with help from my friends! \u2764\ufe0f"]], ["PokeAPI Amazon Alexa Skill", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JAUX72bzh6k?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PokeAPI Amazon Alexa Skill \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/453/874/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To enter this contest: <a href=\"https://www.hackster.io/contests/alexa-api-contest\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.hackster.io/contests/alexa-api-contest</a></p>\n<p>I had to develop a custom Alexa Skill that integrates an with an Open API.

shoulder surfing.</p>\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Privacy is an important part of our day to day lives, and the focus is mainly on online security. However, how do we secure our privacy in public when using our laptops? Many times in lectures or coffee shops, people are looking over your shoulder to see what you're doing, and most of the time you don't even realize this. This is why we thought of the Don't Look desktop application. In order to protect our privacy, we should start on the real world.</p>\n<h3>What it does</h3>\n<p>If multiple faces are detected for an extended period of time, this implies someone is looking at your screen. When this happens, a variety of things can happen depending on the settings. These include: dimming screen or giving a notification to the user.</p>\n<h3>How we built it</h3>\n<p>It uses the OpenCV library to detect faces with your camera. Simply using a timer to detect how long a face is in the direction of your computer will actuate either a notification or dimming of the screen till this face looks away.</p>\n<h3>Challenges we ran into:</h3>\n<p>Making it cross compatible for all operating systems. This especially was true when dimming screens as apple required AppleScript to dim; whereas other operating systems had their unique quirks.</p>\n<h3>Accomplishments we are proud of:</h3>\n<p>It works! We managed to finish everything we wanted to implement, other than a few bonus features.</p>\n<h3>What's next for Don't Look</h3>\n<p>Don't look will eventually be a full featured program that protects a users privacy in the real and online world.</p>\n<h3>Made With:</h3>\n<p>C++, Java, Applescript and OpenCV libraries</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built

I thought about tic-tac-toe, where I built a version of it three years ago using Java and both their Swing and AWT toolkits.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a two-player puzzle game where you need to get six tokens in a row. You can place two tokens at a time. One player places orange cubes, while the other player places blue capsules. If you win, particles start flying all over the tokens you got a win from.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Unity to build the game board, tokens, their particle systems, and user interface. All of the programming was done using C# and the Unity API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Probably dealing with mouse clicks in the spaces of the board. Initially, I thought of screen-to-camera raycasts, which sound appropriate for a 3D game. Eventually, I found out that it would be much simpler to use OnMouseUp() from the MonoBehavior class, which is an event listener on UI elements and colliders. Knowing that what I'm dealing with are 3D colliders, I think it was very effective in this approach. So I took that instead, coding it in a script, and it actually worked.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I now have another simple game to add to my LinkedIn profile and demonstrate to some of my connections, primarily two recruiters from both A Thinking Ape and Electronic Arts.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>In Unity, colliders on 3D objects can have mouse click listeners instead of having raycasts deal with them upon clicking on the screen!</p>\n<h2>What's next for MLH Tic-Hac-Noe</h2>\n<p>I think what's next is probably add some enhancements to it, along with a mode to compete against the opponent, and add some music and sound.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/GregPDesSCH/MLH-Tic-Hac-Noe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/GregPDesSCH/MLH-Tic-Hac-Noe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/685264\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/685264\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.newgrounds.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["ARggghh", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ARggghh \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/137/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ARggghh \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/138/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Playing Pokemon Go in the summer, made us want to enter the world of Augmented Reality. This being a Hackathon to try crazy new things, the three of us dove deep into a field of programming we had never before experienced. We just had to find a problem to apply this to. Searching on our phones for ideas, Sukhpal with his new Oneplus 3, we got into an argument about whose phone was more powerful. That's when we realized; we could apply this to comparing phones and settle our argument.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application shows a list of phones side-by-side with a selected phone that is lying over our ARM (augmented reality marker) mat. Tapping the screen cycles through different models, and has a short description of cost and specs.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>With a lot of research into augmented reality and software we could use to create it, we met Unity. Using Vuforia and some C# we were able to implement 3D models in augmented reality beside the ARM mat.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge had to be fitting the models to scale that are being compared to the phone. This took several hours and multiple arguments.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This whole project. We managed to dive deep into a field of programming we had never touched before and even produced a working proof of concept that actually compiles, runs, and WORKS.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use AR, a bit on live capturing of data, as well as working together as a team without cussing each other out. </p>\n<h2>What's next for ARggghh</h2>\n<p>We actually discussed this a lot. Since this is a proof of concept, we want to firstly expand on this then bring it to new markets. Firstly, we will add more phone models to cycle through, as well as add live feed data instead of static data regarding the phones. After this we will add the ability to cycle through phone colors and phone cases. Once we master the phone market we will move to shoes (cycle through different shoes and colors), shirts (compare a shirt that fits you to other shirts and colors/styles), and more!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vuforia\">vuforia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the designing of the layout in AR.", "I worked on a lot of stuff.", ""]], ["oops", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>oops</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gist.github.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gist.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Botany Info", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>This is a HTML website that I created on botany</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PiceaAbies/botany-website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PiceaAbies/botany-website\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["WordCode", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WordCode \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/193/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We saw that there were many new coders who have come to this hackathon so we decided to make something which helps them out. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It displays the various syntax from different languages.

In light of this, our team decided to take on the challenge proposed by the #hackharassement to develop a cross-platform solution to online harassment by implementing a chrome extension. This chrome extension allows for users to create a safe environment for themselves as they navigate from page to page.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SafeSpace allows users to input trigger words through the extension popup window. The extension will scans a webpage looking for instances of the trigger words. If any of the words are found, a pop up will be displayed that blocks the content of the page before it is loaded, to notify the user. If the user does not want to see the page they can go back, otherwise they can view the webpage were instances of the words are replaced by \"*****\".</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first started by researching more about creating a Google Chrome extension. Once we figured that out, we first started off with only the extension popup HTML and JS files and slowly starting implementing functionality. We split up the work between the team by back-end and front-end development. Regularly, we committed to the master github branch to ensure everyone's implementations were working correctly with each other. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>chrome.storage fullstop. While we thought storing and accessing our data should have been relatively easy, it proved to be very challenging.</p>\n<p>Implementing functionality of the modal window that pops up once a trigger work is detected has not been yet resolved as to implement the modal window, we had to inject HTML into JS.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The back-end and front-end work separately and achieve the functionality we aimed for at the beginning of the Hack Day. Integrating them is yet to be completed, however, we hope to have that completed as we consider our extension to be extremely applicable nowadays. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to create a Google Chrome extension and use the powerful functionality of integrating HTML and JS.</p>\n<h2>What's next for safespace</h2>\n<p>We plan to integrate the back-end and front-end parts together to achieve overall functionality.\nOnce this is complete, we hope to release it as a Google Chrome extension that can be downloaded by anyone.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/afoxall/safespace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/afoxall/safespace\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["NOT THE BEES", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To begin, we started by trying to create a game based on two political leaders that were trying to convince a crowd to join them.

As we all know, investing into the stock market can be a nerve wrecking experience, which will require thousands of dollars for investors to have a significant return on investment. With penny stocks, beginners can invest little and get returns that no blue chip stock can provide back. Starting at as little as $0.01 and to $5.00, penny stocks are great for a high volume trade with maximum potential for quick growth.The Pink Hat Android application provides users with penny stock analysis. With a team of financial analysts, Pink Hat will provide top-picks of penny stocks for investors with no experience, and even investors by trade. Before the market opens, the Pink Hat Android Application will have lists of chosen penny stocks as a guide for investors for that specific day. Our analysis from our financial analysts will provide a foundation for investors to get started with penny stocks.</p>\n<p>Business Model:</p>\n<p>Free Tier: This will give the essential features to customers who want to try out the application. Randomly chosen penny stocks from that day will be provided for app users, to expand their choices for that trading day further.</p>\n<p>PHat+: This will give app users the full list of penny stocks chosen by the market professionals, and artificial intelligence analysis. Graphs, charts, and news will be provided as well giving all the primary benefits for users to take advantage of for their trading needs.</p>\n<p>PHat Premium: With a monthly/ annual fee the users will be able to ask the financial analysts questions regarding daily trading, current popular stocks, brokerage information, and talk to other users. </p>\n<p>Revolutionary and innovative approach for quick return on investments!\nCreated by:</p>\n<p>Mohammad Alqudah\nDaniel Dubovoy\nNermin Shaban</p>\n<p>For MLH Hackathon @Temple University Dec 3, 2016</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/malquda1/MLHHackathonPinkHat\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/malquda1/MLHHackathonPinkHat\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["AFLASH", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRJnD_qhJ2I?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AFLASH \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/454/641/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>AFLASH</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A communication disorder is defined as the impairment in the ability to process and comprehend verbal communication.

The platforms are randomly generated, and as you go the level starts scrolling faster and faster. To counter your players speed, your player is increasing at the exact same speed as well. I chose to do a simple style, only utilizing flat colors and clean shapes. The first time you contact a platform it changes colors and flashes random different colors as long as your contacting it. Also, you are able to wall jump if you hit the side of platform correctly.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built it using Python, specifically the library pygame. Pygame is a library that offers many game friendly functions. I watched a few tutorials on how to do the basics, was given some barebones starter code, and then I got to work. The documentation for pygame is difficult to understand, so I struggled a lot simply trying to use easy functions. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I spent at-least 3 hours just trying to figure out pygame's way of adding images to the screen. In my opinion pygame's way of doing things turned out to be way more complicated then I could ever imagine it being. Just the action of adding text to the screen takes the combination of several different functions. Overall it gave me a much greater respect for game developement, specifically without using a game engine.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was proud when I got the constant side scrolling to work, when I got the platforms to be random, and when I figured out how to use the clock function in pygame to speed up the level and player as you progress.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned pygame is insanely difficult, however I am very slowly getting better at it. I honed my python skills and expanded my logic when it came to certain game specific problems.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cube Runner</h2>\n<p>I have outlined a whole lot of things that I believe I can do in the next few days to make Cube Runner a proper game.\n|\n<strong>Will provide updates to the progress on the bottom</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proper start screen with start button<br/></li>\n<li>Pause when escape is pushed, allowing exit and restart</li>\n<li>End game screen allowing exit and restart</li>\n<li>Score mechanic added.

The Powerbar Timer automatically turns off a power bar after a set amount of time to conserve energy and protect appliances. It was built with an arduino uno and an adafruit motor shield for simplicity and uses a simple code done with the arduino ide. A small servo motor is connected to the motor shield which is connected to the arduino uno and moves to toggle the on/off switch on the power bar, thus turning it on or off. It is a simple yet effective and a practical hack with many uses. \n     One common problem that people run into is when they leave their home after cooking they worry that they left the oven on. A further idea for the Powerbar Timer is to use an arduino wifi or bluetooth shield, to make the power bar remote controlled thus being able to control the power going to the oven or any other appliance. Another example of the uses of the addition of an arduino wifi/bluetooth shield is the ability to turn of a child's gaming console remotely or with the timer. \nThroughout the design and building process we further our knowledge of arduino programming and problem solving having a very fun and enjoyable time along the way. This was our first hack day and we are proud of our ability to design and create this hack and of the fact of how simple and effective it is. We hope to continue attending hack day and expand our knowledge of computer sciences and make more hacks.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">arduino-adifruit-motor-sheild</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mini-servo-motor</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Mind Labyrinth", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/194269413?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0#t=\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Image of Mind Labyrinth Logo\" data-canonical-url=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7Fu0ZDhZkbFlJPYtY40_dx-XaSmYwgyzNkSML8Cg5-d8-8naDyRgWX69YesRoaRHCH4XIB_BP97pYwmbNe-PZvwMcPYJjNw8_fD0hHqQ04WVjoC1lDviQieOtHwz5Qym_dk6cyjW\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--8Q5pG4t7--/https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7Fu0ZDhZkbFlJPYtY40_dx-XaSmYwgyzNkSML8Cg5-d8-8naDyRgWX69YesRoaRHCH4XIB_BP97pYwmbNe-PZvwMcPYJjNw8_fD0hHqQ04WVjoC1lDviQieOtHwz5Qym_dk6cyjW\"/></p>\n<p>As high school students ourselves, we experience a great amount of stress on a daily basis which can be triggered by many factors. Ranging from a large workload, to internal and external conflicts with other angsty individuals, to a lack of sleep, we have oftentimes found that the stress from these conflicts overwhelms our ability to react to bad situations in a constructive way. A study done by the center for adolescent help found that the five stressors most commonly felt by adolescents were school work (78%), parents (68%), romantic relationships (64%), friends\u2019 problems (64%), and younger siblings (64%).\n(<a href=\"https://www.teenhelp.com/stress-anxiety/what-causes-teen-stress/\" rel=\"nofollow\">teenhelp.com</a> ). \nFour of these problems directly involve dealing with other parties, and school work can also be indirectly affected by conflicts you have with your teachers, fellow students, etc. Drawing on personal experience, all four of our group members agreed that conflict resolution can be a daunting task, since conflicts that you have with other people become infinitely more stressful when they involve conflicts within yourselves (as they very often do).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Mind Labyrinth is a simple-to-use online web application which prompts your responses and changes its questions according to what you likely feel the need to talk about the most. It is aimed at helping people facing peer-to-peer conflict who are unsure as to what to do next. Through guiding you through a process of calm thinking on your state of affairs, it ensures you  feel that you have complete understanding on your own self-actualization. Instead of directly telling you what to do, the Mind Labyrinth helps you to reflect on you actions and the consequences. This way, you can make the most rational decision based on your situation and your own perception of what would most likely happen next. Using this method, the Mind Labyrinth is able to help with a large group of individuals facing a variety of personal situations.\nWe believe that if The Mind Labyrinth were used frequently by people around the globe to help logically mediate their choices, the world would be a better place for all. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Conflict-induced stress is inevitable within our daily lives, and it is often difficult to find solutions to these conflicts.  We envisioned the Mind Labyrinth as an online space that acts as a virtual therapist, helping those who are conflicted to express their inner thoughts, let out their emotions, and ultimately, resolve themselves with 100% confidentiality.\nWe built the Mind Labyrinth on a domain given to one of us for an online course using a text editor with PHP processing and HTML and CSS for the website framework. We took special consideration into the visual aspect of this work, with the logo being hand drawn and later rendered in Photoshop Mobile, and the monochromatic colors chosen to prevent \u2019jarring\u2019 or intimidating a user that is already in a likely striking situation (The background is chosen from subtlepatterns.com and the fonts are chosen from fonts.google.com accordingly.).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This being our first hackathon for all four of our members meant that we went into this having a very bare knowledge of what to expect to do with the twelve hours given to work on our project.  The fact that we assembled a team within the first hour of the hackathon (with half of our members not having known each other) also meant that we were unsure as to what assets we all could bring to the table and what our team dynamic would result into. We spent the first two of those twelve hours frantically individually typing into a Google Doc ideas we had as a brainstorming technique (which retrospectively was probably not the greatest way to manage our time) before finding the idea of helping individuals with conflict resolution. That being said, by the end of the project we were all confident that we came out as better teammates in addition to being better hackers!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we\u2019re proud of</h2>\n<p>Although we only had 12 hours to create an extravagant project, we were able to do so with minimal problems and we were productive throughout the day. Starting off having no idea what we were going to make, we ended up with a great project that every team member was proud of and was happy with. In addition to that, it was our first time meeting each other, so our ability to cooperate and work well with a new group of people that we had just met was something to be proud of. As a team of students sharing the same interests, we were able to overcome challenges that we faced, and along the way know more about each other and discover new things about ourselves as well. \nWe managed to fulfill many of our personal goals, have a lot of fun during the process, and create a project beyond what we had expected first entering into the hackathon. We have also received public recognition for our efforts by receiving the \u201cBest First Time Hack\u201d award at Iroquois Ridge High School on December 3rd during Local Hack Day, something which left us all just as satisfied at the end of the day as the character development we felt we all achieved.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This may have been our first hackathon, but it certainly won't be our last! Overall, all of our team members came to a consensus at the end of the awards ceremony that we had progressed as individuals on our general problem solving, collaboration, and initiative skills. Specifically, we also all became more proficient in website building, as we all collaborated on creating every element of the website as a team.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mind Labyrinth</h2>\n<p>As individuals who are genuinely passionate about this never-ending issue, we plan on expanding the accessibility of the Mind Labyrinth and improving it by making the Labyrinth more complex. The first step is to contact real therapists and psychologists and have their input on how they consult with their patients. This way, we can develop more \u201croutes\u201d or \u201cpaths\u201d in the labyrinth, allowing it to meet the needs of a larger variety of people and a larger variety of situations. We also plan on seeking funding/sponsorship to create a more accessible domain name so that we can have it appear on major search engines when people search things like how to best confront someone, deal with doubt in their relationships with other people, and similar situations. Although the motive of the Mind Labyrinth is simply to relieve one\u2019s stress, little by little, we believe that it has the potential to change the lives of individuals across the globe. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ics.actonhighschool.ca/2016-2017/wud7b3f/mindlabyrinth.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ics.actonhighschool.ca/2016-2017/wud7b3f/mindlabyrinth.php\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ics.actonhighschool.ca</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]]]
