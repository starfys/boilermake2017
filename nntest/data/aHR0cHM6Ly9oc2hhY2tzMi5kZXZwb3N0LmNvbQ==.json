Once you choose a genre, the app loads a trending song from Soundcloud and plays a snippet of the song to the user as a preview. This snippet is determined by the density of comments throughout the song. We decided that comment density is a good measure of which part of the song is the best part of the song based on commenting behavior: audio listeners are much more likely to comment on a specific part of the song if they really like it. Through this system, we can retrieve the best part of the song and preview it to the user of the app, allowing the user to experience the best part of the song without having to listen to the entire song. For example, in our tests, EDM and Techno song previews tended to start a few seconds before the drop (the most upbeat part of the song), and Rock and Pop song previews tended to start a few seconds before the chorus. This allows the user to browse through music much more quickly and allows new and emerging artists to be discovered much more easily. </p>\n<p>For each song preview, the album art and song title and artist are shown, as well as a few navigation features. A button allows the user to pause/play the song preview (which can also be done by tapping anywhere on the screen), swiping to the right saves the song to the user's favorites list, and swiping to the left skips the song. Both swipe gestures are used to browse through songs, i.e. each swipe loads a new song. There is also a feature that allows the user to change genres (e.g. rock, country, techno) and another that allows the user to change the sort option (hot or random). The hot sorting option is implemented based on a modified version of Reddit's hotness algorithm.</p>\n<p>Our project began with our interest in music: we love to listen to music, but we wanted to find a better way to discover new music. It would often take at least a minute or two of listening to a song before we get to the song's best part, and it's not guaranteed that we like the song. As a result, with this app, it is now possible to get to the song's best part immediately and made a judgment much more quickly. It dramatically reduces the time spent on discovering music from several minutes per song to only several seconds.</p>\n<p>We are proud of the entire application, both the iOS and backend. The backend efficiently retrieves data through SoundCloud's API and efficiently stores data through memcache and Google's Datastore database. The backend also implements the comment density algorithm, shuffling of the songs so the user will always get new music, and sorting by hotness so the user will always get the hottest music. The iOS end has awesome swipe gestures that make browsing through songs intuitive and easy to use, and gives users the flexibility of choosing their desired genre as well as saving the songs they like.</p>\n<p>Our target users include anyone who loves to listen or create music. Not only does this application make discovering music so much easier and efficient, it also allows emerging artists to be noticed much more easily. It saves audio listeners time in finding their new favorite jams, and gives artists the added bonus of receiving a wider audience to their work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/soundcloud\">soundcloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">datastore</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">memcache</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend; more specifically, I developed a web API that sends JSON data to the iOS app. I used SoundCloud's API to retrieve data about tracks and comments to determine the most popular part of a song and Google App Engine as the platform for the web app. I also used Datastore and memcache for efficient data storage and retrieval and implemented a modified version of Reddit's hotness algorithm to sort the tracks based on the respective metadata.

Using ionic required that we also learn Angular.js and integrate it throughout our application. For our backend, we used Parse, and took advantage of the Parse workshop offered yesterday. To integrate with Facebook, we used Facebook's Graph API.

With our search function on our website, it's very easy to find exactly what you're looking for. Each event is linked with photos from all the users currently in the event, which allows for users to easily see a quick overview of the events around them. With a design specifically created with events in mind, adding photos to events that you are in, and seeking out events near you, Advent creates an ecosystem that pushes these functions in quick access.</p>\n<h2>What is it?</h2>\n<p>Advent is an iOS application that allows pictures to be taken and posted online.

Other students ask if they can borrow money on nearly a daily basis, and there needs to be a way to not only manage our expenses but to also see if we can entrust our hard-earned money to others.</p>\n<p>Enter Ignus. Unlike other apps, Ignus is powerful enough to suit the needs of both high school and college students, while remaining simple enough to be enjoyable to use. Ignus is a social network for payments; it revolves around a system of requests and feedback. If somebody borrows money from you, you can send a request for the money back. The debtor can pay instantly using several popular payment websites, including PayPal and Venmo. After the transaction is complete, you can rate the transaction green, yellow, or red, with green being the best and red being the worst. One\u2019s total ratings are summarized on their own profile, so others can see if they can rely on them to get their money back quickly.</p>\n<p>The app also seeks to expand connections; at first, it starts off by setting a goal of 10 connections. This then moves on to 100 connections, and then 1000, and so on. By holding many connections with others and establishing a strong reputation, you can be sure that you\u2019ll be a person to be trusted.</p>\n<p>Ignus is a cross-platform application running natively on iOS and on the web for other mobile devices and computers.

not supply the photos that we needed to make the project possible, so we had to improvise: by scraping information off of the consumer website, we were able to seamlessly integrate existing content into our app. Later on, the location information that we were passing the another Yelp API was not working, so we had perform extra processing with the Google Reverse-Geocoder API, turning geo-coordinates into streets, cities, and zip codes.</p>\n<h3>What we learned</h3>\n<p>\"Sleep is for the weak\" -- until it causes you to make horrible mistakes and spend excessive time undoing them.

inspiration comes from the numerous events each of our team members has been to, at which it's common for event planners to create an app for their event. These apps often are lacking in aspects of communication between event-goers, as well as communication between the planners and/or supervisors themselves. They are often left with no value after the event's completion and are deleted. However, the most important problem is simply that these apps aren't as fun to use as we realized they could be. Our goals were to give event managers tighter control over staff and attendees, help organizers better communicate during events, and give attendees various features such as chats, maps, shared photos, and feed to improve their event experience. We feel our application will ease the stress off of event managers, keep attendees informed, and improve overall event experiences with great social features. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Enter EventSpace, a revolutionary Android app that is a universal home for any and all events. Individuals can view their upcoming events on a My Events screen.  Event planners create a temporary social network for their event, and event-goers simply download the app and enter the event code given to them to join the event. Once in the event page, they have access to a variety of tools.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Feed section allows anyone (coordinators or company) to post photos and messages for others to like and/or comment on.</li>\n<li>The Photos section compiles photos uploaded from people at the event for all to view.</li>\n<li>Alerts allows planners to quickly reach their attendees with important info using push notifications.</li>\n<li>Attendees provides a comprehensive list of those attending plus staff members and their contact information. Staff members can be directly chatted to in this screen.</li>\n<li>Messaging keeps people connected throughout the event with a chat room. Additionally, staff members have access to the private staff messaging area which allows staff members to communicate and ping certain people if they are needed.</li>\n<li>Maps offers attendees a map of the venue and optional maps for other locations of interest or directions. These features are all configurable by the event creator(s) in the app and on the web dashboard (they can be disabled and enabled to suit different types of events.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When an event is created, a \"temporary social network\" is established, and the event coordinator(s) can distribute their unique code for attendees. (This can be even given in the form of a randomly generated secured link when users RVSP or purchase tickets on an external service, per a partnership). During the event, event-goers, whether at a concert, seminar, tournament, or hackathon, will be able to access the app features on their phones and laptops. During this time, attendees can post on the feed (photos or text) to spark discussion or questions, chat in the group chat, and get important info about scheduling. Finally, at the end of the event, the coordinator(s) have the option to allow attendees to save previous photos and access the network after the event to encourage networking. For example, if you met someone new, you could open up their profile in the app. (NFC could be implemented so attendees can simply tap phones to share profile information).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team being a beginner team, we struggled with our attempts to code and implement such a large idea on Android Studio, which none of us had used before. We spent a majority of our time attempting to understand the basic premises, and with help from mentors, friends, and the Internet, we managed to code the front-end of our project. Because of this, though, we weren't able to finish coding as much of the app as we had wanted.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Even while being beginners, we are all extremely proud of being able to create the output of this app in just 24 hours. Our first breakthrough came when we managed to successfully code the Navigation Drawer, which allows access to all the windows in our app. We also succeeded in coding buttons which, when tapped, would direct the users to a new screen. While the concept is simple and commonplace, we hadn't realized how difficult it was to code. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We undeniably learned a huge amount in this short period of time, as every part of our code is a display of something we had to learn from nothing. Specifically, we taught ourselves how the parts of our code in Java and in xml had to compliment each other to make our programs work. We learned how to create new activities, use res to add photos, use the concept of buttons to link users to different pages on click, how to edit strings, and how to populate listview, among various other things. </p>\n<h2>What's next for EventSpace</h2>\n<p>As we were unable to finish coding EventSpace, there is much more to expect ahead.

A quick and innovative partying planning tool, TFTI frees hosts from the typical burden of hosting a party: risking that nobody shows up. Our \"Tipping-Point\" feature ensures that a certain number of people attend the party or the event is canceled. The deceptively simple change guarantees profit for hosts and makes sure every party is a blast. Combined with a gorgeous interface and geo-location tracking, TFTI is the disruptive party platform of our generation.</p>\n<h1>The Idea</h1>\n<p>Hacking isn't just about pushing the limits of hardware - it's also about pushing the limits of the human mind to strive farther and reach harder. As a result, we decided to make TFTI after looking through problems that we'd been through in similar situations. By making this app, we've built something that we're sure that others, will definitely use as part of their lifestyle.</p>\n<h1>Features</h1>\n<p>TFTI automatically gives you parties that are closest to you by using HTML5 Geolocation, combined with Parse's GEO software. In addition, TFTI also contains an automatic database to keep control of everything from users to parties.</p>\n<p>And once again - thanks for the invite!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">beginner</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">passion</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">fruit</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://tfti.ga/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tfti.ga/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tfti.ga</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["World Information Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"World Information Game \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/946/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"World Information Game \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/947/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"World Information Game \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/948/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"World Information Game \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/949/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"World Information Game \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/950/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"World Information Game \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/951/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>In the year of 2014, human rights violations were recorded in over 90 countries and territories across the world, but not a single mention was made about these tragedies at schools.

Through the medium of a game, the W.I.G. encourages youth social and political involvement, and strives to create a link between people in need and people who have the power to change their situation; students.</p>\n<p>Our best features include :\n-our implementation of the Google Earth API to provide an interactive image of the Earth that students can play with\n-our use of scraping to extract data from the Amnesty International website\n-our use of popups to create an attractive user interface</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["", "", ""], ["Marketplace", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marketplace \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/933/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marketplace \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/934/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marketplace \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/935/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marketplace \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/936/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marketplace \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/937/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marketplace \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/938/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Marketplace \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/939/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As high school students, we've noticed the amount of things that students need and want from each other. Whether these items be used textbooks, SAT prep books, clothing, calculators, prom dresses, or even artwork, it seems that everyone had something they could sell that would benefit someone else. Many students created makeshift photo albums of the items they wanted to sell with captions of the prices, but were often inconvenient because these items often got lost on people's newsfeeds with other posts and even friend privacy settings. Criagslist was a little too unsafe for high school students to manage, and there was no real user-friendly way for students to manage their own markets.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>There is really one main idea to Marketplace: buying and selling items in an extremely user-friendly way. Logging in and connecting with students in your school allows for safer transitions. If you are a seller, all you need to do is take pictures of the items you want to sell and write a price underneath. As a buyer, all you need to do is use the search bar to find what you're looking for and request an item. If you are satisfied with the item you bought, you may rate the seller with a 5-star rating system. With simple buttons and swipes, this app has a clean, simple, and straightforward interface that makes selling easier than ever before.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Being able to integrate accurate intelligent search to find items was the hardest part. It was our first time integrating Azure search, but because of it we were able to deliver accurate search results to users. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Catering to each other's strengths and weaknesses, and working together as a team. Also, the little things - even the five star rating features was something we were glad to implement. Even deciding what to do with the interface to make it as easy and accessible to users as possible was an accomplishment.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As cheesy as it sounds, the importance of teamwork really helped us. We learned how to integrate cloud services into applications. But other than that, making an efficient and simple user interface was actually much more difficult than we expected. For some of us, it was the first time we coded Android applications instead of iOS applications, so there was a lot to pick up and learn.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Marketplace</h2>\n<p>First of all, we really want to make Marketplace available for iOS with the members of the team who are familiar with Apple products. We really want to be able to expand Marketplace to colleges and other friend circles. Also, just fixing up the visual aspects of Marketplace and adding little details - like push notifications, reminders, and other settings - that will clean up the details of the app as much as possible are something we want to look forward to. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitbucket\">bitbucket</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["", "", ""], ["GetFit", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GetFit \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/931/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>This app is to help motivate and keep people on track for their diet and weight plan.

When we started out, we made sure that all of the features of the logic and memory followed that general scheme. As beginners in AI, we tried to make it as simple as possible. From the start, when the user introduces him or herself, the bot learns and makes the association. Later on, when the user puts the bot to sleep, it retains the most important things learned that \"day\". The way it does this is through the \"importance\" value. The more times things are mentioned, the higher their importance value. If the importance value goes above .5, it is stored permanently. The other two values that are important are the confidence and the trust values. Both of these determine whether or not the bot will store the data that the user gives in permanent memory.</p>\n<p>All in all, the robot uses pseudo-emotions, such as importance, confidence, and trust to make decisions such as whether or not to believe the user. This bot opens many doors for programmers to make bots that can slowly become more human-like with each improvement.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud9</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Black Widow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Black Widow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/908/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Black Widow \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/909/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Black Widow \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/910/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Black Widow \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/911/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Our project is an autonomous Quadcopter equipped with an HD camera as well as a series of sensors.

It values your time and allows you to achieve the most possible on a given day by organizing tasks by efficiency. Based on your current location, store hours, and an analysis of the other tasks on your to-do list, it finds the most efficient order of tasks. For example, if you have Costco and Safeway both in your task lists, and Costco closes first, it will put Costco at the top of the list. This guarantees that you will not only save time, but also ensures that you will not arrive to a store when it is closed. That way, you have more time to do what you want to do, without having to worry about another task on the list for tomorrow, and finish your tasks as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Execution:\nParse was used to store accounts and events, such that it can be accessed across any device. \niOS: Apple MapKit's API was used in order to grab the GeoLocation of the user, and Google Place's API was used to gather store hours. \nWeb: HTML5 Geolocation's API was used to retrieve the GeoLocation of the user, and Google Place's API for store hours. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapkit\">mapkit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/brackets\">brackets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I created the website, and used Parse as a backend", "I developed the iOS application using Swift, and also created a backend using Parse."]], ["ConfiCheck", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ConfiCheck \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/869/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ConfiCheck \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/870/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>ConfiCheck is a website that uses a simple interface to allows users to create and interpret confidence intervals for collected data.

We live in an average community where many people spend more than they earn. We would like to improve that helping people save money to live better lives.</p>\n<p>Our app is to help people manage their money by first creating an account consisting of their financial information. After they create their account, BudgeMan would give them a budget fit for them for the month based on the information they have provided. With that budget, they can now go shopping for various products available on BudgeMan which is customized to their budget.</p>\n<p>How it works:</p>\n<p>The user creates a profile: personal information such as their name and address, to mail Items to their location, and financial information: Salary/anum, and their Housing and Utility bill information, to average their budget for the month. With that budget, the user can now go shopping on BudgeMan and buy the products they would like using the ebay API.</p>\n<p>Challenges I ran into</p>\n<p>-Had some difficulty implementing the ebay API to our Webpage.</p>\n<p>-Inserting Google Forms into our Webpage.</p>\n<p>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</p>\n<p>I am proud of our design, the concept of our Webpage and how it can help many people, and as beginners, to be able to use HTML5 and CSS to put our project together.\nWhat I learned</p>\n<p>I learned how to use HTML5 and CSS, and how it is best implemented. I learned that CSS was very useful to make our ideas look alive on our Webpage and how we used HTML5 to get our end result. I learned as I programmed this Webpage with my team about HTML5, CSS, and how to get/use a domain, what an API is, and cover the minimal basics of programming.</p>\n<p>What's next for BudgeMan?:</p>\n<p>My team and I would like to take Budgeman to the next level by having more products to choose from, give the user the feature to input their exact financial information, including taxes, and their average bills for the month for a more accurate budget. We hope that with the concept of our Webpage, we can also launch an app available for Android and iOS mobile devices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wix\">wix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ebayapi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">financial</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">shoppingcart</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://joeketh.wix.com/budgeman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://joeketh.wix.com/budgeman\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>joeketh.wix.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Yen", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yen \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/560/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yen \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/561/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yen \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/562/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yen \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/563/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Yen \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/564/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>  Over time, our team has noticed a common trend amongst smart-phone users - a lack of interest in mobile shopping.

A user can browse through the many categories we provide in our catalog - swiping right if they likes the product (adding it to their Yens), and left if they don't. Depending on what they like/don't like, we will show products which tailor to their interests. From their Yens (favorites) page, they can add items to their cart, and then make the purchases directly from our application (pay through PayPal, and soon Apple Pay) or through the vendor's website.\n\n  Yen - the new way to shop remotely.

The profile option allows the student to verify their class schedule through the file provided by the school itself. </p>\n<p>The mobile integration allows the student to receive quick, on-the-go, assistance whenever and wherever they need. The notifications show who else has answered the student's questions, and the Activities help the student track the discussions they are concurrently participating in.</p>\n<p>A chat interface -- through Moxtra integration -- enables students to have group discussions in the certain classes albeit AP Biology or Mythology. Each class discussion page is loosely monitored by either a class officer or a teacher to help facilitate conversation and help move discussions in the proper discussion.

Users can control the doodler according to their imagination, easily able to take advantage of techniques like spaghetti stranding that are very difficult to program a computer to utilize.  However, our 3d doodler was too heavy for our robotic arm (made of popsicle sticks and duct tape) to support.

HS AnonyX was created to prevent this. We support the idea of closed communicative methods, that do not give out personal identification. We give these kids an opportunity to communicate with their peers without being judged. Everyone deserves an equal voice, but not everyone can express it freely.

Now, wouldn\u2019t it be cool if we could, through that simple interaction, open up a communication channel capable of seamlessly transferring contact information, pictures, or even payments? Introducing <em>TransferWear</em>, the latest innovation adding to the new revolution of wearable devices. Through a simple and routine action, like a handshake, fistbump, or high-five, you can now open a channel of communication with another party or a kiosk. Utilizing the blazing fast <strong>FireBase</strong> database, along with accelerometer data from wearable and mobile devices, we have created a <strong>seamless</strong> and <strong>instant</strong> interaction. By limiting the need of personal information to transfer data, we have created a method of communication that is not only <strong>efficient</strong>, but also <strong>secure</strong>.</p>\n<p>Technical Implementation: Two users are authenticated and a session established by timing hard accelerometer changes combined with location data. Prospective bump events are pushed through a firebase queue up to the server which uses the time of the bump to correlate two different users. Each client is then asked to confirm to connection (the default is an automatic confirm) and then brought to a screen where further interactions including sending contacts, photos, and payments are available. The backend code is written in Node.js because of it\u2019s ease of use in integrating with firebase and the wide availability of packages.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bump\">bump</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">coffee</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-wear\">android-wear</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">soda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">magic</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gobells</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mihirtrivedi.com/transferWear\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mihirtrivedi.com/transferWear\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mihirtrivedi.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the backend.

We saw this as an opportunity to bring enjoyment and the spirit of competition to this once daunting task.

We bring you a simple solution to a big problem: water contamination.</p>\n<p>The DripZ circuit replaces a potentiometer with your liquid of choice and provides a numeric or visual digital display of a quantified value for the electrolyte concentration. We use the conductance of the liquid to determine electrolyte concentration.</p>\n<p>By placing the DripZ interface on municipal water tanks, house water supply tanks, and local village wells in developing nations, communities can ensure that only safe, drinkable water is consumed. If the electrolyte levels in the water supply exceed international safety standards, our device alerts you before you drink anything icky.</p>\n<p>To provide our product at minimal cost to developing nations and communities, we\u2019ve created DripZ Elite, for athletes, to provide an alternate revenue stream for the cost of production. DripZ Elite lets athletes use the same hardware, embedded in a water bottle, to track their electrolyte consumption through a mobile application made using Swift.

Even then, the searching was difficult, as NFPA 704 is usually represented in images, causing the text search to be even more inefficient. I came up with the idea to search from a database.

Unlimited Bullet Festival allows the creation of bullet behaviors via simple text files.</p>\n<p>In UBF, bullets move according to rotation and speed. By writing lines in the UBF script file, you can create intricate and beautiful bullet patterns without clutter.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>//categorizes the script.\ncategory bullet\n\n//set sprite, loaded as texture2d from assets/sprites/resources\nsprite card\n\n//set: sets a value\n//values are: angle, size, speed, x, y\nset angle 10\n\n//add: adds to a value\nadd x 10\n\n//delay: delays the thread\ndelay 2\n\n//make: instantiates a new UBF object w/ speed and rotation\nmake firebullet 3 270\n\n//effect: play an effect\neffect bigcircle\n\n//clear: clears all bullets\nclear\n</code></pre>\n<p>Looping is a bit more complicated. </p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>loop 4,make firebullet 3 10,modify 0 1,0.5\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code will make 4 <code>firebullet</code> bullets with speed 3 and rotation 10. However, each bullet's speed and rotation are incremented by the <code>modify</code> values respectively. Each bullet will delay 0.5 seconds before creating itself. In the above example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>firebullet with speed 3 and rotation 10 at time 0</li>\n<li>firebullet with speed 3 and rotation 11 at time 0.5</li>\n<li>firebullet with speed 3 and rotation 12 at time 1</li>\n<li>firebullet with speed 3 and rotation 13 at time 1.5</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By default, the script will wait for the loop to complete before continuing. To perform the loop as a seperate thread and go to the next command while the loop is still going, simply add <code>nodelay</code> as a fifth parameter</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>loop 4,make firebullet 3 10,modify 0 1,0.5,nodelay\n</code></pre>\n<p>Cutscenes are simple compared to the loop stuff. Cutscenes will pause the game and display the given message until the user presses the fire key.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>cutscene I-am-the-hero\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above code would result in \"I am the hero\" displaying. Make sure to use dashes instead of spaces when delcaring the cutscene string.</p>\n<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>\n<p>Here's a simple bullet that moves downwards for one second, then speeds up.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>category bullet\nset speed 5\nset rotation 270 //this points down\ndelay 1\nadd speed 5\n</code></pre>\n<p>To make bullet patterns such as circles, often a spawner bullet is used in order to create the pattern.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>//CODE FOR SPAWNER\ncategory spawner\n\n//we don't want the spawner to move\nset speed 0 \n\n//loop to create a circle\nloop 120,make regular 3 0,modify 0 3,0.5\n\n//destroy itself when done\ndestroy\n</code></pre>\n<p>Save this as circlespawner.ubf, for example, and anytime you want to create a circle of bullets, simply call <code>make circlespawner 0 0</code>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["i made it", ""]], ["PhysiCalculator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhysiCalculator \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/785/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhysiCalculator \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/786/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhysiCalculator \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/787/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhysiCalculator \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/788/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Everyone who worked on this project is taking a Physics Honors course at our school and we all therefore face the issues associated with physics problems and would like to make them simpler.

We utilized Arduino to create a spinning flower that reacts to your child's voice--the louder they vocalize, the faster the flower revolves.</p>\n<p>Instead of directing his or her anger towards others, your child may now let the flower whirl away his/her screams.  The captivating SoundRev will calm and comfort your child, allowing them to release their irritation in a more positive manner.  The soundRev may also be used as a bluetooth speaker, during which time the flower will react to the vibrations of the music.

But what makes it even worse? Having to write an annotated bibliography. It sucks having to go through all your sources, format each into a citation, AND type more paragraphs to summarize and analyze each source.</p>\n<p>CiteSite uses PHP cURL to automatically scrape web pages for any information it can find for the source's bibliography citation (author, title, publishing company, etc.). Additionally, it gets all the text content from the article and creates both (1) a shortened summary as well as (2) analysis and reflection based on the source's objectivity and usefulness. In the end, the user is able to generate a fully formatted annotated bibliography entry simply by inputting a link. He or she is also able to keep a running list of all entries and copy it to a clipboard or export it to Facebook (temporarily restricted until approval by Facebook, but fully functional on white-listed accounts).</p>\n<p>Essentially, CiteSite takes the pain out of creating annotated bibliographies by streamlining and automating the process. Through a clear, four-step process, it takes you through the steps of citing, summarizing, analyzing, and reflecting on sources - making the life of a student just that much easier. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/curl\">curl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">unirest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stremor</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://citesite.orgfree.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://citesite.orgfree.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>citesite.orgfree.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["TeachQ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TeachQ \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/764/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I'm a student at Santa Teresa and I've noticed in many of my classes that when a teacher asks a question, only the best students answer.

After attending the Mathematica Summer Camp 2014, I realized I could use my skills to make a game of poker; this version of poker is called \"Pot-Limit Omaha.\"</p>\n<p>How it works</p>\n<p>When initializing the cells, you are taken to the welcome page, where you set the sizes of stack per person (user and computer), and the small blind. After clicking \"New Game,\" you are taken to another screen that shows the \"playing area\" in which you see the computer's moves, what the computer bets, and who wins the round. You click on the \"Fold\", \"Check\", \"Call\", \"Bet\" or \"Raise\" buttons, and use sliders to set your desired bets or raises.</p>\n<p>Challenges I ran into</p>\n<p>The computer makes its decisions based off of the equity, or probability of winning the round. The calculations were hard to accomplish; there may even be a few errors in the calculation done in the project as opposed to calculations done through online poker demos. Additionally, the graphics of the board and of the cards were difficult to work with.</p>\n<p>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</p>\n<p>Poker is a game I truly enjoy, and to know that I have made an actual simulation of what I love playing makes me feel proud.</p>\n<p>What I learned</p>\n<p>I knew this before I started the project, but it was still something I had to be more aware of: calculations in a poker game is hard. I knew how to estimate equity in a regular poker game, but to implement an equity calculation in the project that has to be in exact value was the part I had to learn more about.</p>\n<p>What's next for Pot-Limit Omaha</p>\n<p>My next idea would probably be another card/poker game. Pot-Limit Omaha calculations are easier than Texas Hold'em calculations, so going for a harder project such as Texas Hold'em would be another task I would look forward to.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"

So we came up with the idea to make an app where you can search all your parts for your dream build in the same place you will have your budget, other people's opinions, basic builds,  and other successful builds.\nBasically our target user is pretty much anyone who is looking to build a new computer.</p>\n<p>Its hard to determine exactly what key features we are proud of because of the fact, that we have very little experience with any type of code other than HTML. But I would have to say if we had to narrow it down the most impressive feat we have accomplished in this hackathon is our app's navigation bar. We all really wanted it to look a certain way and out of everything the navigation bar is the one that we feel as come the closest than any other feature.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["ProdoCloud", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ProdoCloud \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/728/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ProdoCloud \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/729/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Prodocloud</strong>\nEverybody wastes time on the internet. We have spent countless hours on Facebook or surfing Reddit while we should have been doing homework or studying. We decided that it was time for that to end. Our solution to this problem was to build an extension for Google Chrome. Our extension allows the user to specify their own list of \"unproductive\" websites to be blocked. Additionally, our extension has a companion website, where users can log in and track their browsing habits, which are presented in a clear and user-friendly display. Our hope is that by being more observant of our browsing habits, we can save hours of every day and use them in a more productive manner.</p>\n<p>Our target users are just about anyone! If you find yourself spending unnecessary time on the internet, then you can benefit from this application! </p>\n<p>We are extremely proud of our cloud service implementation.

Despite the vast utility of Java and the curriculum of this course, we wanted to invest some time into developing a game. </p>\n<p>Due to our somewhat ambitious desires and our lack of experience in this area, we decided to start off with a dating sim. While dating sims in essence are always relatively similar, our dating sim brings a unique tilt to this genre with the central idea that the main character is a narcissist. </p>\n<p>The main character is put into a situation where he / she dates a person who possesses many similar qualities. Through a series of questions and unexpected predicaments, the main character is fleshed out to show his true character. This game also allows for a variable personality that is determined by a set of survey questions that are introduced in the introduction of the game.</p>\n<p>We were inspired by our the ingenuity of our team leader, Cassie Kyoko Hondacivic Wang and her equal/if not more powerful  buddy: Julia Wang, who formulated the idea to create a narcissistic dating sim. Our target audience includes people of ages 15 - 99 who generally over exaggerate their alpha dominance and are very found of their own body (those who are asexual). </p>\n<p>The key features that we are proud of include the genius UI that we have created inside the system. The player is allowed to move around while he deliberates on what he should choose to answer the questions. On top of this, our game features a unique graphic design for the UI and high quality textures for the landscape background. </p>\n<p>We had a lot of fun with this. xD \nAyyy lmao.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["In-Then-Out", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"In-Then-Out \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/726/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"In-Then-Out \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/727/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We were in the process of eating In-N-Out Burger's famous foods whilst coming up with an idea for this hackathon.

If Shangyu uploaded a song to Youtube, he would have to be able to garner 100-500 likes or views before he even gets noticed by any college scout or record label of importance. And often, sometimes even the best musicians are not able to get enough hits to be viewed by record labels. \nThis is where Discover comes in. Discover acts as your own little advertiser. The idea of Discover is that anyone who creates a username would be able to upload a song that he or she sang/played to a shared database where everyone can access it. A user of Discover would then open the app, and the database would randomize its contents, selecting a random user and playing his or her song. The user could then like it, skip, comment on it, or rate it. In other words, Discover acts like a peer review of music but also is a instrument of discovering no-name artists or musicians who want to make it big. \nDue to time constraints, we decided to code this app with the use of pictures instead of songs. The idea is the same. A random picture is taken from the database and shown to the user, and the user can like, comment, rate that picture.\nFor the database, we were able to use Firebase, which is a cloud database system. The most challenging part of our app was uploading the picture to Firebase and then converting it back so that the user can see it.\nIn the future, we hope to extend this peer review idea not just to song, but perhaps also to essays for student in high school (where one student can peer review another student's essay.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">server</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">byte</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["WeatherWear", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WeatherWear \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/697/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WeatherWear \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/698/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WeatherWear \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/699/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Purpose: <br/>\nI've often had trouble in the morning before school deciding what clothing I should wear to appropriately dress for the weather.

This app targets travelers and itinerants who spend their time outdoors often for work and travel. </p>\n<p>Technologies Used: <br/>\nWeatherWear uses ReactiveCocoa libraries, REST-based APIs, and the OpenWeather API to fetch and display weather data. It creates RAC signals and retrieves JSON data from specific URLs in the API in the model, converts them into Objective-C properties in the controller, and uses that to update the view. Functional programming was an instrumental part of the design in retrieving and updating the weather information. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mantle</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/openweathermap\">openweathermap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">beginner</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tsmessages</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">reactive-cocoa</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">functional-programming</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nishanthrs/WeatherWear\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nishanthrs/WeatherWear\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nishanthrs/WeatherWear\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nishanthrs/WeatherWear\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked individually on all aspects of the project, including design, development, and API integration.

Using tessel.io, we then power the servo motors that power one of three \"pins\" which match the pins that were hit in the Unity simulation. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tessel.io</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Flappy Friends", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flappy Friends \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/705/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flappy Friends \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/706/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>This hack was created in less than 2 hours.

This allows the user to text and avoid accidents due to the app's ability to project what is in front of the user. Thus, while anyone with an android device that texts can use the app, the target users are teenagers as they tend to utilize texting more than any other age group. We are proud to introduce a smart messaging app with sending and receiving functionality along with a live video feed in the same activity. In addition, we have imported the user's contact list for ease of use.  We have a major improvements for this app in the future including object congregation for detecting street objects (such as cars and poles) and warning the user.  We also plan to significantly improve the UI by allocating more space for the camera video feed.  For the keyboard, we plan to add a sliding functionality that allows you to move the cursor with ease. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intellij-idea\">intellij-idea</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jdk</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Starcatcher", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Starcatcher \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/655/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Starcatcher \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/656/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Starcatcher \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/657/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Starcatcher \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/658/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Starcatcher \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/665/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration for my game was the classic \"happy\" dream that a kid has; unicorns, grass, sun, fluffy clouds, and falling stars.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The game is simple; slide the cloud left and right to catch the stars as they fall and earn points.

Our target users are new dog owners and breeders. The app uses the principle of positive reinforcement to make a sound when the dog does something correctly. The owner/trainer presses a button on their phone in order to emit one of four sounds in order to reinforce the dog's understanding of good behavior. We're very proud to present the app with an integrated website in order to track the progress of every dog.

Another problem is to also know if it's going to rain today. So, i took both my problems together and found a solution, SkyWatchApparel.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>It is an ios app that we created using swift targeted for school going girls.  In the app you can set the longitude and latitude for the place whose weather you are trying to find. We used the API from openweathermap (<a href=\"http://api.openweathermap.org)to\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://api.openweathermap.org)to</a> find the weather for every 3 hours. We coded so that the weather is calculated into 4 different summaries. First priority is given to snowy, second to rainy and third to sunny. So that if its snowy, it takes you to the viewcontroller that shows girls can wear that day to school. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We are iOS beginners and we just started learning two weeks ago.  Some challenges we ran into were switching between different view controllers, as it kept crashing. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We got a working pogramme and we could get fashionable outfits in an app that is very useful.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned to think like a programmer and we also learned how to break down through errors to find a solution.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SkyWatchApparel</h2>\n<p>First we will get the iOS developer licence, so that we can publish it on the appstore. We will extend the app to boys and all age levels. We will also try to intergrate the programme with the GPS to find the latitude and longitude faster. We will also try to attach the nearest shop name and price along with every piece of cloth. We are also planning to extend it to Android.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uikit\">uikit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/openweathermap\">openweathermap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">swiftyjson</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Pebble Watch Face", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebble Watch Face \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/632/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebble Watch Face \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/633/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I had 2 pebbles that I could use, but had problems making an app for it.\nI just thought of an idea, and made it right away, which it worked.</p>\n<p>Target users will be pebble owners that attended HSHACKS II</p>\n<p>I am most proud of the logo and the fact that I actually did something at the first hackathon that I attended.</p>\n<h1>beginner</h1>\n<h1>pebble</h1>\n<h1>firsthackathon</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Centr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Centr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/654/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Our inspiration for the project began when one of our teammate's relatives with a home automation system constantly complained about how a phone application  was pretty inconvenient remote, despite the benefits already given of controlling many Smart Systems. We thought we could have simplified this much more by providing voice activated control and much more!</p>\n<h1>What our product does</h1>\n<p>Using high-end algorithms through extensive modifications, we have created a voice control that allows users to control any smart appliance, whether that be in the form of nest, Smart home, Revolv, or our own circuiting. Additionally, we notify users on any phone notifications ranging from games to phone calls to text messages; Centr will both light up and say the notification of the phone. \nThe next product we have somewhat conquered is the voice command for our TV, which allows users to browse the web, search for functions of the TV directly using voice control. Get ready for the preview at the pitch :)</p>\n<h1>What challenges did we face</h1>\n<p>We ran into several challenges with this project, many of which required extensive collaboration and research. First we were given poor APIs to work with such as the voice control, thus had to do a lot of modification with code; this took up a lot of our time. Also, it challenged us greatly when we broke two of our circuit boards while wiring the motherboard and kept overflowing our RAM ultimately leading to StackOverFlow. You know it's a great hack when StackOverFlow occurs many times. :)</p>\n<h2>What we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are extremely proud of the fact that we were able to utilize a low-end algorithm for voice control and transformed it into a usable, user-friendly universal controller. We also boast exceptional pricing as we also took the challenge of minimizing prices points to create our minimum viable product and are proud of the hack we did to stream phone notifications on our Android.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Going into the Hackathon with limited knowledge in hardware, we learned A LOT in terms of hardware product production. The past projects we had done were all software intensive. Our team has tampered with the Raspberry Pi; however our project called for a lot more than simple wiring and programs</p>\n<h2>What's next for Centr</h2>\n<p>our goals in the future:1) we hope to form Centr into a startup with three main target markets in providing a \"cool technology\" for college dorm rooms, bringing convenience to current home automation users, and providing a user-friendly product for retirement homes\n2) We feel our company has great potential of growth in terms of future projects we have in mind, many of which are patent-quality designs and ideas. One of the next products we will pursue in terms of home automation is providing a universal controller  to empower users with control over any system ranging from your coffee machine to cars to door locks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ethanreid.github.io/#\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ethanreid.github.io/#\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ethanreid.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Safe Scan", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/639/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/640/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/641/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/642/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/643/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/644/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/646/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Safe Scan \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/651/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>One day, my mom and I walked into a mall. We saw a Q.R. code advertisement on the wall that had a coupon for 80% off in JC Penny. Hard to comprehend this once-in-a-lifetime deal, my mom scanned the link and went to the website. Immediately a virus downloaded on her computer, and it turned out the website wasn't JC Penny's but a malware one. So, I set out to build Safe Scan, an android application that checks if a url is safe or not. First, the app opens up a Q.R. code scanner that scans a Q.R. code with a url. Then, the app checks if the url is malware or not by implementing the Google Safe Browsing Lookup API. Then, if the url is safe, the app will suggest opening it up in a browser and if it is not safe, it will warn the user. The product is targeted towards women that like shopping at malls and like great deals (pretty much every lady). These women will greatly benefit from my product due to added security enhancements. I am very thankful to the Safe Browsing API as this makes up the key features of my app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-safe-browsing\">google-safe-browsing</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Wanted", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wanted \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/638/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Background Story</h2>\n<p>You are the most wanted criminal in the galaxy and the feds have finally found you out.

Due to our beginner knowledge and little time we did not finish our hack, but as a learning experience we hope to make it an app and incorporate the hack into a conversation based client.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Damble", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Damble \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/607/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Damble \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/608/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Damble \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/609/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Damble \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/610/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Damble \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/611/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Damble \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/612/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>beginner  : Originally we decided to just come to the Hackathon and have fun.

We started this project to help a friend with many allergies. We wanted to ensure that he would know of the specific foods served at restaurants. The first time he went to Five Guys, he found out to his dismay that he could not eat anything because everything was covered in peanut oil. Our target user is anyone with any number of food allergies much like our friend. We are most proud of the data scraping and aggregation we did in order to provide these services. We hosted our application with Google App Engine and then used Yelp's API to determine if a restaurant was appropriate for a certain allergy. We did this by analyzing the prevalence of key words in the menu, ingredients and reviews. We identified the portions of the reviews that commented on the foods themselves. Based on this we can provide a spectrum of different outputs: Whether the user cannot go to a restaurant at all, go there and order something specific, or go there and order anything. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">creative</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">beginner</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">macvim</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mostcreative</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bestbeginner</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">innovative</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mostinnovative</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://tough-artwork-850.appspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tough-artwork-850.appspot.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tough-artwork-850.appspot.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Itinerate", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Itinerate \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/589/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Itinerate \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/590/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Itinerate \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/591/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Itinerate \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/592/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Itinerate \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/593/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Designing a vacation is difficult, and we wanted to make it easy.

Using our web app, one can quickly perform multiple tasks relating to their input; examples are defining a word, opening a website, etc. (many more features to be added in further renditions) One of the more complex tasks D.A.R.W.I.N. is capable of is allowing the user to search for relevant articles on the internet, then pull a how many ever of these articles they want and display them as separate tabs/windows within the browser.\n We'd like to say that our main inspiration was the popular voice assistant for Apple's iPhone, Siri. Using the ideology that one could easily open up an app and give it simple commands, then have the device execute otherwise tedious processes seemed like a blessing for us. We had two rather different main targets in mind when developing this app, and they were: 1) A person who wasn't willing to grind through the otherwise tedious tasks of searching the internet, opening new pages and such, and 2) Budding \"superusers\" who want to slice through computer UI like butter and use the computer to their full advantage, taking control of the features provided in our app to increase the speed and productivity of their worktime. In a way, however, these two groups of people are the same. They both want to spend less time \"navigating\" and more time \"doing\". In other words, people like this are the future of the internet and the world as a whole. D.A.R.W.I.N.'s goal is to take the people of tomorrow to tomorrow itself. \"They say that people pay a lot for convenience ...

Luckily, people have created the perfect solution where users can generate a Bitcoin wallet and print it on a piece of paper without leaving a digital trace. After all, you cant hack a piece of paper. I got my idea from the principle that you cant hack a piece of paper.</p>\n<h2>What does my application do?</h2>\n<p>My ruby gem generates a pdf, with a list of secure two factor authentication codes generated using a keypair. The user can print out that pdf and start using it as two factor auth codes. My ruby gem also has a method which allows the site to easily verify the two factor authentication code.</p>\n<h2>How do users user it?</h2>\n<p>Its simple. They sign up at a website using paper authentication, and print out the pdf generated for them. Then, they fold along the dotted lines, and trim of any excess paper. When they want to find a code, all they have to do is hold it up to the light, and they will be able to see the full code which they can type into their computer.</p>\n<h2>Target users</h2>\n<p>The target users for this application would be security and privacy fanatics.</p>\n<h2>What am I most proud of?</h2>\n<p>I am really happy with how the pdf generation turned out.

It's scientifically proven that teenagers who get enough sleep are able to act more productively throughout the day and have more stable mental health. In the past there was no tool to control the amount of sleep students get, so organizations were limited only to recommendations about optimal amount of sleep. These days the rise of wearable tech and health tracking algorithms, such as apple health kit, gives an ability to control sleep habits of students using combination of software and gamified incentives.</p>\n<p>We have designed the app, which puts sleep tracking on the next level. Sandman System allows users to create closed monitoring groups in which they can share their sleep data and receive rewards for achieve the sleep goals. It opens opportunities for teachers to improve grades of their students, through ensuring enough sleep, gives companies ability to get more productive and polite employees and much more. Our team has built it to be absolutely universal, no matter in what group you are in or what device/app you use to track sleep - Sandman will be able to take advantage of the data and improve your sleeping habits.  </p>\n<p>Sandman System consists of two parts: native app and cloud backend.

I just wanted a simple test server, but I couldn't really find any that suited my needs. That turned into Browsver. </p>\n<p>Browsver uses a main server and a \"browser server\", communicating between them using a <strong>Websocket</strong>. When the main server gets a request from a user, it forwards the GET and POST parameters as well as the URL to the browser. The browser handles this data, and sends back a response through the Websocket.</p>\n<p>I believe that the concept of Browsver wouldn't just be useful as a quick development tool, but also as a promoter of Internet equality. Absolutely anybody with just an internet connection and a browser can create their own virtual server in their browser quickly and easily, without the need for an expensive hosting plan (and only Javascript and HTML required!).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">body-parser</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://evening-meadow-6059.herokuapp.com/create\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://evening-meadow-6059.herokuapp.com/create\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>evening-meadow-6059.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Notiflyer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notiflyer \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/543/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notiflyer \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/544/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notiflyer \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/545/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notiflyer \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/546/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Notiflyer \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/547/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We are targeting the users who want to get free products, without too much struggle.

We got the Twitter API working but we had to have premium Spotify to use their API. Second, I tried to do something with tracking motion but OpenCV is really horrible to install. So we came up with this idea to have a completely anonymous chat where anyone can join and no one knows who is who or even who sent what. It's better than IRC! Plus, it doesn't store user data or the messages. Its backend has absolutely no database! No logins either! Thus, messages are just pushed to the client's browser and not saved in anyway. So what happens when the client refreshes or closes the session? Poof! The whole chat is gone. Great for people who want to stay anonymous or are Anonymous. <br/>\nWe are Anonymoose.<br/>\nWe are trolleys<br/>\nWe do not procrastinate<br/>\nWe do not cooperate<br/>\nWe're shitty.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso because of OpenCV, my $PATH is completely screwed up. It'll probably take me another hour to fix :(. The goal of this project was absolutely nothing. This project solved 0 real world problems. It might have 5 more real world problems. And the whole project lacks CSS (which is \"intentional\"). :D<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the live website does not work properly but the localhost works properly. :(\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI worked with 2 complete beginners (who do not have a challengepost) and taught them Python, HTML, and CSS.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is a pretty beginner hack.... I don't think it's even beginner. I think it's way below beginner. Like 500% below beginner.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWell, anyways, the live app doesn't work right now but I'll work on making it work soon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">node.jsistheonlyrealdevlanguage</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cascadingstylesheets</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hypertextmarkuplanguage</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">howtomeetladies</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://cryptic-garden-8066.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://cryptic-garden-8066.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cryptic-garden-8066.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Spinshooter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/syX6J2kK5Gs?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spinshooter \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/539/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Inspiration: Best idea for a game we could come up with</p>\n<p>How it works: The player tries to dodge projectiles emerging from the center by changing the direction of a circle moving in a circular motion</p>\n<p>Challenges I ran into: Using JFrames, Creating and repainting more than one of each object</p>\n<p>Accomplishments that I'm proud of: High-level graphics manipulation, Thorough usage of JFrames</p>\n<p>What I learned: Graphics, JFrames, JPanels, Sound, KeyListener</p>\n<p>What's next for SpinShooter: Android and iOS apps</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">keylistener</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["CsPractice V1.0", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CsPractice V1.0 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/211/538/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Being our first hackathon, we came here hoping to focus on learning and workshops, but we changed our mind!

Furthermore, there are two types of tests: multiple choice and free response. In the multiple choice test, the system will grade how the user does in the test; in the free response portion, however, the user will first write what they think the definition is, then compare it to the actual definition after the test. Then, the user will self-determine if their definitions were correct or not. </p>\n<p>This flexibility allows for a variety of user-interaction that would benefit many users. However, the main target user are students from elementary school to college, and possibly beyond. This application is mainly used for remembering things ranging from mathematical equations to the name of a historical king. Thus, even professionals could use the application to their liking for remembering advanced and difficult concepts.</p>\n<p>The part I am probably most proud of in my program is its flexibility. The user controls nearly everything that the app does - they control how the tests work and they control what words to use and what definitions to use. Most importantly of all, however, the app has implemented remember-deletion - if a term has been tested correctly multiple times, it will be erased from the memory of the app, as it has been \"remembered\" by the user. This, too, is manageable by the user, and can even be disabled.</p>\n<p>EasyVocab is easy to use and easy to set up, making it perfect for busy high school seniors and hyperactive span third graders. It's flexibility with the user's wishes further enhance the app and makes it stand out among all the other quiz apps out there. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ios-simulator</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">expert</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">advanced</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
