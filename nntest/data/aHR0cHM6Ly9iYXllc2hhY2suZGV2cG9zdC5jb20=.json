Thorn\u2019s mission, to be digital defenders of children, resonates deep within us. We have been proud to work together to help geolocate and discover previously unnoticed prostitution rings within the United States.</p>\n<p>Using soft text matching, we cluster Adult posts by their peculiar semantics. By collecting sets of geographic locations, timestamps and even phone numbers we identify \u201cAdult cells,\u201d one more more individuals working together to proliferate prostitution.</p>\n<p>You can see some of the final results here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Real-time API for identifying escort cells: <a href=\"http://146.148.77.166:8089/api/recent\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://146.148.77.166:8089/api/recent</a></li>\n<li>Visualization of historical escort cells: <a href=\"https://thorn.ngrok.com/#/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://thorn.ngrok.com/#/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We truly hope to continue work on this endeavor and aid law enforcement in shutting down these horrific groups.</p>\n<h2>Algorithm</h2>\n<p>We focused on a two fold approach:</p>\n<p>Initially, we built quick visualizations of location and prices of Adult posts.\nGoing deeper, we used a heuristic matching strategy to identify Adult cells.</p>\n<h3>Geolocation and price extraction</h3>\n<p>To geolocate adult posts we first extracted city names from the given tsv. As the \u201clocation\u201d column was structured enough for exact state / country resolution, we focused on backing out state names from cities. We built an Elasticsearch gazetteer (Geographic index) using the <a href=\"https://github.com/foursquare/quattroshapes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foursquare\u2019s Quattroshapes</a> and customized a scoring function to boost on both city name matches and population size.</p>\n<p>To extract prices from unstructured description fields we tested two methodologies. First, a heuristic set of regular expressions built on observation. Second, we leveraged <a href=\"nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stanford\u2019s 7 class NER</a> to extract PRICE tags from descriptions. Due to the brevity and lack of clarity in adult posts, this second method performed with lower recall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/jisaacso/team-thorn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Work can be seen here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Adult Cell identification</h3>\n<p>Our strategy was to pick a phone number at random. Then use long, unique, exact, substring-match search to discover other phone numbers operated by the same people. This allows us to iteratively explore the listings and phone numbers, generating an increasingly large set of networks over time.</p>\n<p>The computation was quite intensive, so we ran the computation on a cluster of 10 n1-standard-1 VMs on the Google compute cloud to complete the analysis.</p>\n<p>The algorithm begins by getting a list of all phone numbers, here:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/network-expand.js#L35\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/network-expand.js#L35</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/src/parse/phones.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/src/parse/phones.js</a></p>\n<p>A single phone number is expanded to a set of long (15 words), unique substrings extracted from all the listings associated with that telephone number:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/network-expand.js#L42\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/network-expand.js#L42</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/src/search/phrases.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/src/search/phrases.js</a></p>\n<p>The phone number\u2019s 15-word phrases are tested for exact matches against other listings:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/network-expand.js#L45\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/network-expand.js#L45</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/src/search/phones.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/src/search/phones.js</a>\nWhen an 15-word, exact match is found, the two phone numbers become part of the same network.</p>\n<p>For final analysis, we flatten the graph of connections and output basic analysis:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/graph.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/graph.js</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/analyze.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/reinpk/thorn/blob/master/scripts/analyze.js</a></p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Our historical crawler indexed 38,600 phone numbers from the Thorn dataset. Within those listings we detected <strong>143 separate networks of connected phone numbers</strong>.</li>\n<li>Our <strong>real-time API endpoint at <a href=\"http://146.148.77.166:8089/api/recent\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://146.148.77.166:8089/api/recent</a></strong> indexes new escort postings within roughly an hour, automatically detecting the relevant phone number network</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"image of alaska escort post on real-time api endpoint\" data-canonical-url=\"https://cldup.com/0UxCUzwjLI.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--cCGqDQ-j--/https://cldup.com/0UxCUzwjLI.png\"/></p>\n<p>One of the networks we detected is very large, with nearly 38,200 phone numbers. The length of matching strings, overlapping phone numbers, overlapping names, and extensive use of the same unicode character styles indicates that it is one network.</p>\n<p>Beyond the huge network, we detected 142 smaller networks. For example (408) 512-6428 was associated with a 19-number network centered here in the Bay Area, and (347) 363-6681 was associated with a 12-number network based in New York City. On average each smaller network has 4 associated phone numbers.</p>\n<p>We believe these computed networks represent real-world social networks, and perhaps trafficking rings, pimps, etc.</p>\n<h2>Future Work</h2>\n<p>The impact of this project extends far beyond this hackathon. Building on our basic adult cell discovery algorithms, Bayes Impact has the opportunity to impact millions of women and children worldwide. Moving forward, we recommend a two-fold approach for improving cell detection.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>For efficiency, adult advertisements should be indexed into Elasticsearch for fast recall and high precision. The current implementation in node.js + csv files was good for a quick start, but not scalable or robust.</p></li>\n<li><p>For automation, anomaly detection can be built on top of our cell discovery network. Often, we rediscover the same sets of individuals across the United States. Previously unseen sets of individuals and locations are indicative of a growth in a new adult cell. Such anomalies can be surfaced via our geographic visualization.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">elastic-search</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://thorn.ngrok.com/#/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://thorn.ngrok.com/#/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>thorn.ngrok.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["React", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"React \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/208/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2></h2><h1>React: Drug Safety in Your Pocket</h1>\n<p><strong>Team: scikit_hammertime</strong><br/>\n==================================<br/>\nJake Beard: jake at minnow dot io <br/>\nAnjney Midha: anjney at stanford dot edu<br/>\nAnkit Kumar: ankitk at stanford dot edu<br/>\nJay Hack: jhack at stanford dot edu<br/>\nRoss Lazerowitz: rosslazer at gmail dot com<br/></p>\n<p>Bayes Impact Hackathon 2014<br/>\n==================================<br/>\n<strong>The Problem:</strong><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li>100,000 Americans die each year due to known drug side effect</li>\n<li>Existing tools for users to search for adverse drug interactions are clunky, database level query interfaces</li>\n<li>Existing tools are limited to reported drug events -

Teachers have turned to the website DonorsChoose.org to seek private donations for their classrooms.  In order to maximize giving, DonorsChoose should make donating as easy as possible. Yet with the myriad of projects seeking support on DonorsChoose.org, it's difficult to decide where to place a donation. Even after narrowing with several filters, decision fatigue sets in when searches result in multiple pages of options. </p>\n<p>We propose a simple solution to this hurdle: display an \"Impact Score\" at each step. By using a statistical approach, Bayes Impact and DonorsChoose.org can reduce information overload, allowing donors to filter by the metrics they care about and quickly determine where their donations will do the most good. The \"Impact Score\" measures the variables that most correlate with funded projects, meaning that donors won't waste time backing projects that won't ever meet their minimum funding goal.</p>\n<p>Our prototype not only provides a solution for donors, but for teachers as well:</p>\n<p>For donors, a map-based search makes it easy to drill into a geographic region of interest.  The map displays schools as bubbles, sized by Impact Score and colored by common search filters. </p>\n<p>For teachers, we provide a location-based predictive model that calculates the impact factors that are most important to donors in their area, enabling teachers to better understand how to tailor their requests to get funded.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://54.235.192.59:5000\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://54.235.192.59:5000</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">shiny</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://seedescriptionforlink.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://seedescriptionforlink.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>seedescriptionforlink.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Hack DV offenders!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack DV offenders! \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/200/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack DV offenders! \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/201/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack DV offenders! \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/202/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack DV offenders! \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/203/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack DV offenders! \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/204/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack DV offenders! \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/205/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>INTRO\nUsing language similarity algorithm to identify patterns between offenders in the felony space. We used Quid to compute the language similarity for the criminal behavior of the parties:</p>\n<p>(Figure 1)</p>\n<p>In the graph each node represent an offender and it is clustered according to the type of criminal behavior that person has engaged in. The clusters are determined by features from their case charges. Connection between nodes depict similar criminal behavior between two individuals.</p>\n<p>Removing the nodes with only one criminal case we remove three large clusters in our network; in particular clusters relating to minor assault, battery assault and assault on females. (We can visually demonstrate the HPPD's policies to warn offenders seems to be working as minor incidents don't show a high likelihood of a repeat offense.) </p>\n<p>(Figure 2)</p>\n<p>Insight: The fact that entire clusters relative to a minor offenses disappears when we identify single perpetrators does not mean that those behaviors are the not likely to be perpetrated multiple times by an individual. Instead, we can see that to identify serial criminal behavior we have to look for criminals that commit other kinds of felonies. (DV seems to be pervasive across the population but unrelated criminal behavior is a good signal for higher probability of DV.) This signal can help officers gauge/identify high-risk households from other criminal records. </p>\n<p>GENDER\nBy plotting the previous network with nodes colored according to gender (of offender) we note that females have high betweenness centrality. The betweenness centrality in network science represents the capability of a node to act as a bridge that connect two or more clusters. We infer here that males seem to specialize (repeat crimes) females are prone to commit crimes without an apparent pattern.</p>\n<p>(Figure 3 &amp; 4)</p>\n<p>CALCULATOR\nIt would be extremely useful for the police to have the ability to identify recidivism according to some metadata like gender, sex or nature of the first crime committed by a person. In order to provide this competence we used Bayesian inference to calculate the probability that a certain person is likely to be a serial criminal. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://172.16.10.19:5000\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://172.16.10.19:5000</a></p>\n<p>(Note: At the moment, for the sake of simplicity, we calculate probabilities based on boolean and not categorical variables. E.g. we do not account the kinds of crime events in all the ones identified by our clusters, but we distinguish just severe offenders (A and B on the DV list) and non-severe crimes (C and D on the DV list), weekday vs. weekend, etc.)</p>\n<p>CASE SIMILARITY METRICS\nUsing the same rationale as before we can create a network topology where nodes are single criminal cases and group them according to environmental metadata not present in the dataset (like price of the house where the crime happened) and characteristics of the perpetrator (age, race, priors). Here the network heuristics have been computed using simple cosine similarity without Quid to show that the method can be implemented with open-source software:</p>\n<p>(See Figure 5)</p>\n<p>A TOOL FOR THE FIELD\nWe want to give officers in the field the opportunity to understand with a certain probability the scenario they may encounter in the field. For this purpose we developed the Crime Scene calculator that, using as input historical data, like the occurrence of crime at a certain day of the week or the ethnicity of the perpetrator, provides the likelihood that the person will be involved in severe DV (category A and B).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://daniel.cartodb.com/viz/2cdcf5f2-6d56-11e4-b6e2-0e9d821ea90d/embed_map\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://daniel.cartodb.com/viz/2cdcf5f2-6d56-11e4-b6e2-0e9d821ea90d/embed_map</a></p>\n<p>FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS\nInclude different pieces of datasets to explore more efficiently hidden patterns:\nGDP per zipcode area\nSports outcomes (local basketball/football, etc.)\nReal estate prices\nWeather conditions</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cartodb\">cartodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gephi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">quid</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Prevent Domestic Violence in High Point", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Prevent Domestic Violence in High Point \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/209/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Prevent Domestic Violence in High Point \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/210/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Instead of requiring victims of to drive the interventions, public agencies in High Point has created several level of interventions that are based on criminal record and officer assessments. </p>\n<p>The interventions vary from sending a form letter to a home visit by a detective.

Through a combination of natural language processing and heuristic information about the posts, we have been able to identify hundreds of crime rings that operate in multiple states soliciting services of numerous women.  By analyzing the textual information within each ring, we further determine which rings are more likely to exploit underage women. We believe that identification of crime rings will allow law enforcement to better focus their efforts to fight sexual exploitation and human trafficking.</p>\n<p>One of the most descriptive attributes of an online escort service post is the provided phone number. These have to be legitimate as the posters want the readers to be able to reach them. But we can\u2019t simply identify crime rings by looking at the number of posts associated with a single phone number: it is possible for an individual to repeatedly post the same ad with the same contact information. We resolved this by scannings the posts for the contained female names, and considering the geographic information. We then identify an organized crime ring by focusing on a single phone number that is associated posts contained many female names and  multiple geographic locations. The single phone number likely connects to a dispatches who then coordinates the services. Some of the identified crime rings are shown below. </p>\n<p><strong>Identified crime rings. The color corresponds to a single phone number.</strong>\n<img alt=\"My image\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/Zfvlv3U.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--ggAPB_pU--/http://i.imgur.com/Zfvlv3U.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Identifying crime rings by a phone number is too limiting: a single crime ring could easily employ multiple dispatchers. So we looked for similarity in the text of the posts across multiple phone numbers. We vectorized individual post texts by converting them to a bag of words after normalization of the texts and stop word removal. Next using these wordvectors, we computed the average Jaccard similarity between sets of phone numbers. This allowed us to identify when multiple phone numbers actually belong to the same \"crime ring\". Using this method, we found 22 connections among the top 50 phone-based crime rings. The longest chain consisted of five separate phone numbers. An example of two of such rings, along with the similar posts in each are shown below.</p>\n<p><strong>Five phone-based crime rings linked together because their postings used similar text.</strong>\n<img alt=\"My image\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/fYq6006.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--BVKNGng4--/http://i.imgur.com/fYq6006.jpg\"/></p>\n<p><strong>An example of similar posts with different phone numbers and distinct female names. We identify these as belonging to the same crime ring.</strong></p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>hey gentlemen i'm sexy, sophisticated, passionate provider. sweet, bubbly personality love building exciting new relationships! im perfect life size barbie!!! enjoy sweet friendly attitude, never rush, allowing relax enjoy time together. soft sweet voice, embracing passionate touch.

We expected to see a somewhat linear trend, but found that most people had posted less than 25 ads before apparently either changing phone numbers, or discontinuing their use of the site.</p>\n<p>We began to suspect that people were using pre-paid cell phones and changing phone-numbers after making them public on the ad website a certain number of times. It seemed like something that would imply that they were trying to avoid detection by the authorities. Thus, we tried to identify those people that were using \"burner phones\" as they seemed the most likely to be trying to hide something.</p>\n<p>In inspecting some of the examples of posts from the same phone number, some looked very similar, with only a few words changed. It occurred to us that looking for extremely similar documents would be one way to identify people, as new ads were likely to be copies of old ones.</p>\n<p>In order to do this we took a filtered view of the dataset by the three largest metro-areas, Atlanta, New York City and Los Angeles and filtered any observations with no phone number provided. This yielded a dataset with 266,555 rows. From there we used a TFIDF vectorizer to grab chunks of sentences to act as the post's \"signature\". We used a 3-gram representation to do this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=10, ngram_range=(3, 3))\ncorpus = vectorizer.fit_transform(df.postText.values)\n</code></pre>\n<p>For instance, a post with the content: \"We Cater to Upscale Gentleman and We Are very Open Minded\"</p>\n<p>Would be broken into \"we cater to\", \"cater to upscale\", \"to upscale gentleman\", etc.</p>\n<p>In order identify similar posts, we used a distance measure, the cosine distance, to see how similar other posts in the corpus were. In order to fit this into the time available, we focused on a few ads that we had noticed had very similar copy to others in our initial exploration of the dataset. One of these ads was from someone using the moniker \"Stacy Hustles\".</p>\n<p>After choosing a \"seed\" ad, we sought all posts that were within a very close distance of it using the cosine metric discussed above. </p>\n<p>At this point we noticed that the closest ads all shared the main copy, but had a different girl's name, and a different phone number. It was clear that we had stumbled upon a network of individuals who were in some way or other working together.</p>\n<p>We then repeated the process using the new phone numbers we had discovered and grew the network further. At each iteration, new members we discovered and the final result of the \"Stacy\" network is shown below:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"stacy's graph\" data-canonical-url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tja-ag/bayes_hackathon/master/graph.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--1S_QRraT--/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tja-ag/bayes_hackathon/master/graph.png\"/></p>\n<p>Taking a new seed ad, the process was repeated and a new cluster found. Interestingly this cluster contained almost identical posts from both Atlanta and Los Angeles. The ads use the same names and copy with only a different phone number. We don't claim to understand the implications of this interstate relationship, but suspect that a larger organization may be involved.</p>\n<h1>Impact</h1>\n<p>With more time and resources, we believe that this process can be scaled to identify small and large networks within the cities and nationwide. </p>\n<p>It could be used to find individuals masking their identities with fake phone numbers, or track criminals that have been known to use these message boards to facilitate their illicit operations.</p>\n<p>Trevor &amp; Tom</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Water Sources Hack for CA", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Water Sources Hack for CA \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/206/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Water is the most important resource for society.

We decided to tackle this challenge using the dataset from the CA Healthcare Foundation. It collects data and reported information from all the 1200+ facilites.</h5>\n<h2>The Big Question</h2>\n<h4>How prepared are we to accommodate the growth in the elderly population in California? How can we determine what districts are lacking in nursing home services, and determine which districts are lacking in high-quality nursing home services?</h4>\n<h2>Who This Helps</h2>\n<h4>The users we thought that would benefit would be government planning agencies, public healthcare providers, and private healthcare providers.  They need information on where to target efforts.</h4>\n<h2>Things Considered</h2>\n<h3>Population Growth</h3>\n<h4>Projections of population changes (including migrations, births, deaths) were obtained from a public dataset.  It has estimates for every year for every age group for every county in California.</h4>\n<h4>We assumed:</h4>\n<h4>- rate for 65+ populations by county represent expected growth in demand for care</h4>\n<h4>This way we could get projections for nursing home populations in the future at any T years in future.</h4>\n<h2>Open Beds</h2>\n<h4>We calculated this from taking the occupancy rate and number of beds in each zip code. By factoring in the expected population growth for that zip code, we estimated how many open beds would be needed in the future (or not)</h4>\n<h2>Scoring</h2>\n<h4>To produce a score, we ultimately considered the number of beds per zip code and how that would change with respect to population growth.  Because the counties differ in overall size, the scores are normalized to the total beds originally in that county.  The same increase in beds for a small county would have a greater impact than the same increase in a larger county.</h4>\n<h2>Areas that Lack Space</h2>\n<h4>Since there was no historical information for our factors, we only used population projections to look out 5, 10, and 20 years:</h4>\n<h4>- The zip code with the worst score is always the same (in Los Angeles)</h4>\n<h4>- Since all areas are expecting population growth, the highest scoring areas generally stay that way</h4>\n<h2>Links to Visuals</h2>\n<h4>Top scores (Higher is worse)</h4>\n<h4>- 5 year score <a href=\"http://cdb.io/1xuxARa\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cdb.io/1xuxARa</a></h4>\n<h4>- 10 year score    <a href=\"http://cdb.io/1xuyQ6T\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cdb.io/1xuyQ6T</a></h4>\n<h4>- 20 year score    <a href=\"http://cdb.io/1xuzhhK\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cdb.io/1xuzhhK</a></h4>\n<h4>- 5 year pct growth    <a href=\"http://cdb.io/1xuzKR5\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cdb.io/1xuzKR5</a></h4>\n<h4>- current occup rate   <a href=\"http://cdb.io/1xuA1mS\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cdb.io/1xuA1mS</a></h4>\n<h4>- bed use 5 years  <a href=\"http://cdb.io/1xuACVM\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cdb.io/1xuACVM</a></h4>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cartodb\">cartodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["MineData.org", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQ24_gfCYuU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MineData.org \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/198/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There are thousands of active mines in the United States where safety issues can cause losses of life.

Taking the latitude and longitude of SF, we binned the city into multiple geographic buckets.  Then we looked for historic trends for crimes in those bucket.  We modeled the effect of weekly seasonality on the probability of each crime type, but more interestingly we wanted to know if the streets being too quiet can also have an effect on the probabilities.  We ran a logistic regression against weekly seasonality and a linear and quadratic term for the number of days without a crime. Unsurprisingly the higher the number of days without a crime the higher the probability is of a new crime appearing.</p>\n<p>We summarized the evolution of the probability of a crime on an animated map.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microstrategy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">redbull</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tableau\">tableau</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Domestic Violence Profiler #AllAboutTheBayes", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Domestic Violence Profiler #AllAboutTheBayes \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/184/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Domestic Violence Profiler #AllAboutTheBayes \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/185/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Domestic Violence Profiler #AllAboutTheBayes \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/186/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Domestic Violence Profiler #AllAboutTheBayes \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/187/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Over the last 24h, we built a tool for cops to identify the most prominent offenders based on the history of their interactions with the police station.</p>\n<p>Domestic Violence (DV) is a challenging issue.

Key features of our prediction model include very specific individual knowledge such as the number of times a DV call to the PC originated from their house, when was the last one, whether this person has multiple police reports for drugs or alcohol, whether they committed violent offenses in the past and how violent these were, etc.\nThe relevance of all these features is let to our Elastic Net Logistic Regression model.\nThe model gets smarter every week of new data.\nThe model already provides insightful predictions.

They would like to be able to predict labor violations, yet unfortunately lack quality data with which to make meaningful predictions.  We partially address the problem by utilizing a complementary dataset to substantially enhance our features.</p>\n<h1>The Data</h1>\n<h3>WHD</h3>\n<p>The WHD (Wage and Hour Compliance Action Data) dataset consists of a single csv file with 188,000 records.  This may seem like a lot, but there are many types of violations hiding in this file.  In addition, most of the text fields suffer from poor data entry and data normalization practices.  To address these issues, we decided to narrowly focus our efforts on one type of violation - the H1B visa violation.  Only a small fraction, 1552, of the investigations resulted in an H1B violation.  However, the small sample size is outweighed by the availability of copious amounts of supplementary data on the H1B visa program.</p>\n<h3>LCA (Labor Condition Application) / H-1B</h3>\n<p>In order to enhance the usefulness of our data, we decided to merge the H1B visa application data into the WHD dataset.  This is a much better dataset (although still beset by data entry issues), containing wage, position, and application data for every visa filing made since 2008.  Due to inconsistent data format issues, we decided to restrict our merge to visa applications from 2010 onwards.  There were about 2,000,000 applications cataloged in the LCA database for these years.</p>\n<h1>The Merge</h1>\n<p>By far the most difficult part of our project was merging the two datasets together.  There is no unique company identifier in either dataset, so we were forced to use the company name as a primary key.  In addition to having two names for each company in the WHD dataset, both datasets suffer from both typos and inconsistencies in the naming.  To address this, we wrote a fairly elaborate name normalization system that strips out common suffixes, as well as punctuation and whitespace, before using Levenshtein distance to compare two names (threshold for a match - 0.92 ratio).  While there are some false positives, the rate is acceptably small and basically unavoidable.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>whitespace_re = re.compile(r'\\s')\nsuffix_re = re.compile(r'INC$|LLC$|INCORPORATED$')\nbad_words_re = re.compile(r'GROUP|DISTRICT|CORPORATION|CORP')\ndef normalize_name(name):\n  name = name.upper()\n  name = name.translate(string.maketrans(\"\",\"\"), string.punctuation)\n  name = whitespace_re.sub(' ',name)\n  name = suffix_re.sub('',name)\n  name = bad_words_re.sub('',name)\n  name = name.strip()\n  return name\n</code></pre>\n<p>Even with a decent string comparison function, actually comparing approximately 160,000 names from the WHD dataset to around 200,000 from the LCA dataset is obviously intractable with a brute force solution.  We solved this problem by building a lookup table to decide what to compare, based on the first word in the company name.  If the word didn't match, we didn't compare.  This approach has obvious issues, but is quite fast.</p>\n<p>After building the index, we were able to filter the datasets against each other.  We identified 600,000 visa applications from companies that were investigated, and 3,100 investigations of companies that filed at least one visa application.  Progress!!  We believe that both of these numbers understate the true prevalence due to errors in our matching system, but they are probably within 10%.</p>\n<h1>Feature Engineering</h1>\n<p>We had a few hypotheses we wanted to test in order to identify suspicious behavior.  In order to test these, we built a feature vector for each company in both the violation and visa dataset.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>   Are larger companies more likely to violate?  We used total visa applications to investigate.</li>\n<li>   Do cheaper companies commit more violations?  We look at a bunch of salary features - average lower and upper bound on the wage, the prevailing wage determination, and some ratios.</li>\n<li>   Do companies with more rejected or withdrawn visa applications relative to their total violate?  We look at the percent of applications with each outcome.</li>\n<li>   Are certain industries a problem?  We look at NAICS (Industry Name) and most common job type.</li>\n<li>   Do some geographies violate more frequently than others?  We investigated rates across different states.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>All in all, we found visa applications from 269 violators.  Presumably, the rest of them were from visa application years that we didn't investigate or name matching errors.  With these, and the 2,814 matching investigated companies with no H-1B violations, we could finally make some predictions.  What is the best predictor of violations in an investigation?</p>\n<p><img alt=\"New Jersey\" data-canonical-url=\"http://imgur.com/kuCmqb9.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--4EaQqXXm--/http://imgur.com/kuCmqb9.png\"/></p>\n<p>New Jersey!  Nearly 50% of investigations into New Jersey companies resulted in violations.  This is by far the worst rate of any state, clobbering California's measly 12% violation rate.  Clearly, clubbing and spray tans are not a great way to learn labor ethics.</p>\n<p>Looking at industry, our ANOVA calculation was unable to provide statistical significance due to the large number of options, but inspection reveals that software consulting is a common culprit.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Consulting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/46BqLTf.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--MWCmsqS7--/http://i.imgur.com/46BqLTf.png\"/></p>\n<p>We expected to find that denied and withdrawn applications indicated a questionable employer, however much to our surprise neither of these things seem to matter very much.  Proportionally more withdrawn applications are slightly indicative of violations, but it\u2019s really small.</p>\n<p>Wage rate also is a statistically significant predictor of recidivism (although weaker than the above two).  Lower wage applications, measured against any of our salary metrics, are more likely to lead to or indicate violations.  The correlation isn't very strong, but the salary data is interesting independently.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Wage Lower\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/b8p0d5J.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--n2Qt53WC--/http://i.imgur.com/b8p0d5J.png\"/></p>\n<p>This histogram shows the average lower salary bound for our visas.  All H-1B visa applications include two wage numbers, indicating the lowest and highest salary the employer is willing to pay.  These numbers are legally binding, without filing a new visa application you can't cut pay or raise pay outside the range.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Wage Range\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/UklTx2S.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--QMx_uQzI--/http://i.imgur.com/UklTx2S.png\"/></p>\n<p>The wage range is the difference between these lower and upper salary bounds.  Higher ranges indicate more lucrative positions, and correspondingly we find higher ranges to be less indicative of violations.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"PW Diff\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/FFSnxjD.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--BXVOzhjp--/http://i.imgur.com/FFSnxjD.png\"/></p>\n<p>Yet another salary concept from the wonderful world of visas is the Prevailing Wage.  Employers are not allowed to pay an H-1B candidate less than the prevailing wage for that occupation in the US.  This graph shows the difference between the lower bound salary and prevailing wage determination.  Usually, employers request a minimum salary at or slightly above the prevailing wage.  Those who don't are more likely to lose their application, so it's fairly rare to request less.  Violations of the prevailing wage regulations are probably the source of most H-1B issues.</p>\n<h1>Future Work</h1>\n<p>Pursuing this project has uncovered glaring issues in the Department of Labor open data sources.  Further work without addressing these issues is almost pointless.  By far the most important thing to improve is the original source data.  That being said, there are lots of additional data sources that theoretically can bridge the gap between our existing predictions and an actually useful model.  Every company has a record in some database, and many of these are vastly superior to the surveyed datasets.  Some examples: EDGAR, Crunchbase, or even state incorporation filings.  It's very likely that predictive features are hiding in plain site / behind the lack of a good primary key like EIN or D&amp;B Number.</p>\n<h1>PSA</h1>\n<p>Get on <a href=\"http://join.hired.com/x/JOqHBZ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hired</a> and benefit from data driven recruiting!

Our solution provides a technique that gives recommendations for educational tools for both teachers and students, and also gives insight on how to present/deliver those recommendations according to segments.  The people who can benefit from this solution are the teachers and students themselves through the products we recommend, but also coordinators from the Gates Foundation who need to understand the actions and philosophies of the teachers they help; through this understanding the coordinators can know how to communicate with the teachers in order to convince them of new teaching strategies.  </p>\n<p>The survey results are stored in a 400 column spreadsheet; many variables are highly correlated with others, so it's hard to keep track of whether a variable is redundant or contributing new information.  First we needed to use a dimensionality reduction algorithm, PCA in this case.  We can't explode the dataset through one hot encoding, so we needed to select relevant columns by hand.  Applying Principal Components reveals a scatterplot that can be thought of as a communication/targetting strategy (see images in pdf).  It created two indices that describe a teacher's teaching actions and philosophies, which are more targeted attributes than the demographics of the teacher's school.  Knowing what quadrant a teacher is in helps to guide the communication strategy: if the teacher indexes in the upper right no targeting is necessary.  When indexing in the upper left the teacher believes digital tools are helpful but does not use any yet; the teacher has potential.  If indexing in the lower left the teacher is not a believer and needs convincing first that digital tools are useful, through training or live demonstration for example.  Finally indexing in the lower right the teacher needs immediate assistance, as he/she is wasting time using tools that have no value.  </p>\n<p>Having a system to understand the strategy is important for the executers; they still need to know how to help the classrooms.  Instead of identifying needs for each cluster level, we went directly to providing individual recommendations for the teachers and students. Combining all the datasets available from the Gates Foundation, there was a hidden gem that revealed teacher preferences for characteristics of digital tools.  Likewise there was a dataset showing different products and their characteristics.  The characteristics are determined by voting from other people in how effective the product is for a given characteristic, so this matrix needs to be normalized for voting differences.  In the end the recommendation is a cross product of the normalized teacher-preference vector and the product-characteristic vector.</p>\n<p>If there is a way to link which students belong to which teachers, then we can take recommendations for teacher A and recommendations for students B,C,D,... and find the overlap in order to make everyone in the classroom happy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-compute-engine\">google-compute-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">redbull</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1xapWdu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bit.ly/1xapWdu\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bit.ly</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["FormBig", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>\"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\" - Abraham Lincoln </p>\n<p>FormBig is built on the idea that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Data collection should be simple.</li>\n<li>Data collection should not require IT.</li>\n<li>Data collection tools should be extensible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FormBig automatically converts uploaded Word documents (.docx format) into HTML web forms.

This data set is a list of descriptions of investigations into alleged wage and benefits violations (employers paying late, underpaying, etc.). The prompt originally called for something \"predictive\", regarding which employers will violate next. However, it became clear quickly that predicting which employer will violate next wasn't in this data - the features just weren't there. But there might be an opportunity to say something about which employers will violate again.</p>\n<h1>Motivation</h1>\n<p>We thought the Wage and Benefits data set would be interesting and productive for a few reasons.</p>\n<p>First, with wage growth stagnant in the US, ensuring workers receive the pay they are entitled to is hugely important.</p>\n<p>Second, we assumed government data would be cleaner (addresses normalized, for example). We were wrong. The Department of Labor is not the NSA.</p>\n<h1>Target User</h1>\n<p>With sufficiently developed analysis, the Department of Labor or potential employees or any business based in the U.S. could benefit. The DoL can alter inspection patterns, and job seekers can avoid toxic employers if they have the luxury to do so.</p>\n<h1>Tools</h1>\n<p>We used the IPython Notebook with Pandas to load and clean the data. Visualizations were created in Javascript with D3.js.</p>\n<h1>Discoveries</h1>\n<h3>Select Observations</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The recidivism rate drops significantly (current data state suggests around 50%) for employers whose Civil Monetary Penalty was in the top quartile of all initial penalties vs the bottom quartile. This suggests, at first glance, that stiffer penalties may help prevent repeat offenses (at least for smaller businesses).</li>\n<li>Recidivism is lower than expected. The current state of the data puts the recidivism rate above 6%, but this number is likely to rise as more correct groupings are identified.</li>\n<li>A few offenders, especially the United States Postal Service, Walmart, USProtect Corporation, X-Press Sweeping, AT&amp;T, and Comcast (to name a few from a long list) are frequent offenders accounting for a significant fraction of repeat violations.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Process and Issues</h3>\n<p>Frankly, it's surprising how messy the data is. Although the DoL does offer a functioning search page to find wage violations by business name (awesome), the messiness of the data and lack of more detailed information makes it difficult for even a motivated searcher to remain informed.</p>\n<p>Addresses are not normalized, typos exist in all fields (in even dates), and legal names are inconsistent. We very aggressively normalized and stripped the <code>trade name</code>, <code>legal name</code> fields. We created an <code>address</code> field assembling and parsing the included geographic information info a standard form. We developed an process to identify rows where 2 of the 3 \"essential\" fields were shared (<code>trade_name</code>, <code>legal_name</code>, and <code>address</code>) and join them as one <code>entity</code>.</p>\n<p>We tried to normalize <code>trade_name</code> and <code>legal_name</code> using Levenshtein distance, and then Jaro\u2013Winkler distance as similarity measures, but they didn't work as well as simply removing punctuation and spaces. In retrospect, a slightly modified Jaro-Winkler (weighing both prefix and suffix) on top of the aggressive normalization would have probably worked well.</p>\n<p>A few thousand rows were also cleaned by hand while scripts were running.</p>\n<p>About 70% of our total group time was spent cleaning the data to a point where we could group entities with a fair degree of confidence, and with some more time (and sleep) we're confident we could have produced a few more interesting graphs.</p>\n<h1>Future Plans</h1>\n<p>If the data set was cleaned to the state it ought to be, there's quite <a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/whd/statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a lot of interesting exploratory research</a> that can be performed. It would also be much easier to join this data with another interesting set to try and get at the more \"predictive\" angle of interest to the DoL. Here are some questions that came to mind despite 20 hours of high color-temperature light cleaning this data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How does the violation amount (total backwages) change for repeat violations over time?</li>\n<li>Do repeat offenders offend more often or for more money the next time?</li>\n<li>Do penalties have a greater effect on larger businesses or smaller businesses? Does the size of the penalty matter?</li>\n<li>Do repeat offenders continually violate the same laws (FLSA, MSPA, etc.)?</li>\n<li>Are certain kinds of violations (FLSA, MSPA, etc.) more likely to co-occur with each other?</li>\n<li>How do changes in a state or county's economic climate effect the likelihood of a wage violation?</li>\n<li>Do the inspectors of the DoL have preferences or biases with regard to assessing different industries or businesses with penalties?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>... and many more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">department-of-labor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ipython-notebook</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">whd</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://frozen-taiga-1666.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://frozen-taiga-1666.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>frozen-taiga-1666.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Noora Health takes on Ebola", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Noora Health takes on Ebola \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/187/179/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>The Organization</strong><br/>\n   \"Noora Health (YC14) is a non-profit with a hospital education platform for patients and their family to teach them the skills needed to recover from a major medical event or manage chronic conditions.\"<br/><br/>\n<strong>The Challenge</strong><br/>\n   \"Noora Health has developed a cell phone based system that delivers educational health content to people in low-resource settings.
