They would then fill out these hard-copy forms and bring them to UFB when they volunteer.  The UFB staff would then need to manually input all of this information to the Microsoft Access database.</p>\n<p>This project will automate the process of managing volunteer information by giving the volunteers the opportunity to submit their information online via the UFB website.  This information would then be automatically pulled into the Microsoft Access database.</p>\n<p>This project will accomplish the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Minimize handwriting errors</li>\n<li> Minimize duplications in the system</li>\n<li> Free up volunteer/staff time that could be spent on other tasks:\n\n<ul>\n<li> 12 hours per week of volunteer (donated) time</li>\n<li>  8  hours per week of staff (paid) time</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Volunteers will input their information into the forms on the WordPress website, and it will be automatically stored in a temporary database on the WordPress site.  A connection is created between this database and an Excel spreadsheet that will query the site at given time intervals.  From here, Microsoft Access will be used to import this Excel file and append the data to the permanent database of volunteers.  The temporary database on the WordPress site is cleared, and the permanent database is queried to get an updated list of all the emails.  This list will be used to avoid duplicate submissions in volunteer data by alerting the user if they already have an account and only allowing the volunteer forms to be completed for a volunteer with a unique email address.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In order to build this project, we had to figure out how to pass data between WordPress, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft Access.  Because there was no clear way to directly export the form data submitted in WordPress to the database in Microsoft Access, we used an Excel Internet Query to export the data to Excel as an intermediate step.  Once this Excel Internet Query file was exported, it was set up to automatically update at given intervals to reflect the current entries in the WordPress database.  Shortcuts were created in Microsoft Access, which allowed the changes in this Excel sheet to be quickly imported/appended to the Microsoft Access database.  We then created a query to fetch all the emails in the database and used another shortcut to export these to a text file.  Once this text file was updated with the current emails in the database, it was used to check future volunteer submissions on WordPress to avoid duplicate volunteer entries into the system. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The challenge of our chosen nonprofit United Food Bank is that they are still manually entering volunteer information and hours into their Microsoft Access database.  The challenge we faced was to figure out how to transfer the right data fields to auto populate correctly into the corresponding fields of their Access database.  Once we managed to find a way to streamline this, the biggest challenge we ran into was that our testing website kept crashing and it delayed our progress significantly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Some of our milestone accomplishments were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Storing form data on a temporary WordPress database</li>\n<li> Moving data from WordPress to Excel</li>\n<li> Syncing up the Excel sheet to communicate with WordPress forms so it can be imported into Access</li>\n<li> Importing of Excel file into MS Access database</li>\n<li> Exporting a list of all the emails in the MS Access database which could later be used to avoid duplicate volunteers</li>\n<li> Step by step documentation with appropriate screenshots for nonprofit to follow procedure to implement system on their own</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As first time hackers, we learned a lot.

They had a half built website with massive deadlinks on major pages, not mobile friendly and CCCC had no idea how to even edit the site at all. They have had this site for two years! I knew they needed a solid simple but effective solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The site for Chandler Food bank delivers the 5 different non-profit areas of CCCC and allows them to donate, Check events and even Volunteer online which used to be an articulate deal with printing, filling out, and bringing the form in person.\nAlso because the previous site was so hard to maintain we built this website easy to edit, add, remove events. Literally a click on the text and it's then editable. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We  built the website with the Angular.js on the frontend. It allows the site to be a single page application. No need to request and send data back and forth while browsing the site. Flipping through organizations in a matter of moments. Also we used Angularjs to populate, hide, expand on click's through the site for smoother  transitions. We made use of MongoLabs Database as a service for database management of articles and events. Also Angular.js in combination with REST api's through MongoDB our database, allowed us to dynamically send the edits to the database and then back to the website in a milliseconds with Databinding(meaning no page refreshes). For our backend to route those REST api's we used Node.js popular framework Express.js. For authentication we used Passportjs to lay the foundation of validation on authentication on the admin side. Used AngularJs, a Wysig editor, and filtering  to make it easy and simple to edit.  Also used open source Sass and bootstrap for Styling, Jquery and open source jquery plugins such as Slickjs and Stickyjs to add fun interactivity to the site</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a team of three and two of us where knowledgeable in the JavaScript full stack where our third teamate just knew html. So we took on the challenge to tutor and show him how working on software works with the Node platform. Challenge was there was only two people devoloping the site.</p>\n<p>Also in the later morning time when we got deeper into Mongodb my Computer(Thomas) needed the Visual studio and the entire .net framework to actually run our code on my machine. The download took several hours which ended up still not fixing the computer so  we  had to have one computer working and actually running  and testing the server changes.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this time we gave too much data to git. Git then ate a third of our code which we then had to go through commits, pulls, etc</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>That we busted through our challenges and built a responsive website for Food Bank</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Using the JS Stack in a new and interesting way with Editing in real time with Angular. We learned some new tools and techniques through implementation that we had never before used today.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Food Bank</h2>\n<p>If Food bank decides to use the website we built for them  we would gladly help them set it up on their server, Finish setting up, tweeking the website for Production Environment</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gulp-js\">gulp.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bower\">bower</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/npm\">npm</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bycrept</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongolab\">mongolab</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2015-Arizona/Team9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2015-Arizona/Team9\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Kickback", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/220/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/221/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/222/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/223/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/224/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/225/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/226/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kickback \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/227/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Millions of people suffer from cancer each year.
