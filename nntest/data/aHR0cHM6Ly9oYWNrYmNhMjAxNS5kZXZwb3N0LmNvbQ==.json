[["Pixy Beats", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There is one problem that causes rhythm games like Guitar Hero to not be popular today. That is the criticism that states that you do not play 'real' music, but instead only use a guitar-shaped controller. We set out to make a system that will allow the user to learn and play real music.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>This works by using a couple of parts. The main brain of the operation is the Pixy camera, a camera that is configured to find blocks of colors, and output the position. Using this, and a system to convert Midi files into bars similar to how guitar hero is displayed. This Midi file would then be overlaid on top of the video from the Pixy, which would then be fed into a form of VR headset similar to the oculus rift.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some issues when it came to communicating with the Pixy and Arduino. We went through the Edison, Leonardo, and the Uno, until the Uno was able to do what we needed. We also learned that we can not pull both coordinates and Video from the Pixy simultaneously, so in order to make a fully functioning camera, we would need two separate cameras.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to figure out the communication tricks we needed in order to get coordinates from the Pixy. We also were able to manipulate a MIDI file to display falling notes on an image of a piano. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Communication through Arduino boards. Working with Pixy camera. Communicating with mentors and finding help from the right people; making connections. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Pixy Beats</h2>\n<p>Integrating a second camera in order to make full use of our project. In addition, optimizing our project in order to make it be able to display the data live. Using Google Cardboard or some other virtual reality project to bring the screen from the computer to your face. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pixy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">virtual-reality</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Smith", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>What it is</h2>\n<p>Smith lets users record patterns of knocks, which are tied to several functions in iOS, such as calling someone, or running a workflow.

Last month I messed up my wheel alignment because of a pothole, and now I'm just tired. We were inspired to create <em>PotHead</em>, an onboard pothole sensor using the Intel Edison Board and Python+Flask. We want to improve city infrastructure maintenance, and we're starting with something we all know and love, Potholes. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We start off with the Intel Edison Board. This board runs a python script that read output from an accelerometer. When the z acceleration is beyond a certain threshold, the sensor registers that you hit a pothole, and gets ready to send a request to the database. Our Edison creates a POST request to the digital-ocean database, and registers that you've hit a pothole in the city's database. The city can then see all the potholes encountered throughout the city, and can decide the best plan of action to fix them.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h6>A lot.</h6>\n<p>This was our first time working with the Edison board, and hardware hacking in general, so getting used to the basics of electric components was  time-consuming. We tried really hard not to fry any parts. </p>\n<p>We also had problems with creating an API, and making sure any faulty requests wouldn't break anything.</p>\n<p>(We also kept mixing up longitude and latitude, but we don't like to talk about that)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h6>We got it to work!</h6>\n<p>Of course, 1 hour before project submission, everything decides to work and we're rushed for time, but we managed to implement most of the basic features we wanted to see in Phase 1. It was really cool to see the physical sensor trigger an API call on our server in another state!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Hardware Hacking Basics, Serial Ports, Analog vs. Digital signals, Intel Edison, Arduino, Creating API Best Practices</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/accelerometer\">accelerometer</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["reLEAF: Personal Concussion Testing", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"reLEAF: Personal Concussion Testing \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/236/004/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"reLEAF: Personal Concussion Testing \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/236/003/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"reLEAF: Personal Concussion Testing \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/236/002/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"reLEAF: Personal Concussion Testing \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/236/001/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Concussions are one of the most prevalent traumatic brain injury among high school students. Our portable, personal concussion test helps athletes and coaches on the field get immediate medical diagnosis on this life-threatening issue. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>There are currently two stages of concussion testing for different markets. \nThe larger, more widely applicable system is the personal Concussion System Inventory which uses a Likter Scale for the 12 most common concussion symptoms. It compares it to an established baseline and concussion levels of 641 athletes as found in the following study: Randolph, C., Millis, S., Barr, W. B., McCrea, M., Guskiewicz, K. M., Hammeke, T. A., &amp; Kelly, J. P. (2009). Concussion Symptom Inventory: An Empirically Derived Scale for Monitoring Resolution of Symptoms Following Sport-Related Concussion. Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology, 24(3), 219\u2013229. doi:10.1093/arclin/acp025. </p>\n<p>The second, more exclusive system is using the Intel Edison Developer Kit which assesses reaction time based on the time taken to press a button after an LED bulb is lit. This establishes a baseline reaction time for concussed athletes and persons to compare to after head injury. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team originally tried to develop the app on the Android SDK. However. the SDK was extremely glitchy and difficult to work with. The emulator would not launch our app despite saying there were no bugs, causing us to turn instead to Intel XDX. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team is proud of not only our collaborative work throughout the night, but also our incorporation of the Intel Edison, which we had not originally planned for, as well as our use of JavaScript, a language all of us were largely unfamiliar with. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for reLEAF</h2>\n<p>reLEAF will expand to iOS and Android Apps as well as expand into other First Aid Applications.

So we decided to make an app that would encrypt and decrypt messages using a Vigen\u00e8re Cipher, which was thought to be unbreakable for over 50 years.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The app has an instructions tab, an encryption tab, and a decryption tab. We created a constant array that contained a complete Vigen\u00e8re table as well as functions that converted characters to integers and vice versa. Within the encryption page, we simply converted all characters into numbers, followed the rules of a Vigen\u00e8re cipher, and converted back to letters. We followed the same process for the decryption page, just with slightly different logic in order to perform the Vigen\u00e8re rules backwards.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>While Swift is a great language that can do lots of things that other languages can't, converting characters to integers and back was a challenge. The other problem was the multiple text fields on each page; each was difficult to manage as there was a keyboard to deal with for each one. And, of course, human error and our own mistaken logic did cause some setbacks, but we worked through all of them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We came into hackBCA with EXTREMELY limited knowledge of Swift and Xcode. I, Katie, am very proud of the logic that I wrote by myself that controlled the actual encryption process.

I'm a programmer and I really never learned much about computer components or anything like that; that bothered me. What better way to remedy such a problem than to build an entire 8-bit computer from scratch using nothing but basic logic gates?! Well, that's what I did.</p>\n<p>Of course, building the entire computer is way too big an undertaking to finish within 24 hours (especially if you started out not even knowing how to use a breadboard like me). I Set out to build what I could - the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU has an adder and a subtracter that, as their names suggest, add and subtract binary numbers. I ended up building the entire full-adder.</p>\n<p>Beyond just having to learn everything from the basics of breadboarding to the make-up of logic gates, I had a lot of trouble with, well, troubleshooting. I guess, that's just the nature of the beast - when you have something complex, a lot of stuff can go wrong. The bulk of my time was taken up just figuring out what wasn't working.</p>\n<p>I have never built something as complex as this. I've programmed a lot of pretty crazy things, but I've never actually put together anything nearly as complicated and advanced as a full-adder of an ALU. The fact that I was able to go from 0 knowledge of hardware, to a functional piece of a computer in just 24 hours is a pretty good source of pride for me.</p>\n<p>I learned A LOT. I learned how and why electrical components such as transistors and resistors work. I learned how to prototype on a breadboard as well as several pretty cool practices for doing so. I learned all about how to build various logic gates as well as how they work. I learned all about the makeup and functioning of computers on the most basic level. I learned a lot about electrical engineering as well as how binary counting works.</p>\n<p>After this hackathon, I will definitely be working more on the 8-bit computer. I will finish up the subtracter and put the adder together with it to form the ALU. I will then have to build the 555 clock, the bus, the memory and RAM, various registers, and the output \"display.\" After all the hardware is finished, I will use an EEPROM programmer to give the computer a set of instructions and a basic OS (if you can call it that).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">transistors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">resistors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">breadboards</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wires</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jumpercables</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">multimeter</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led's</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">batteries-+-battery-pack</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Zombie VR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>I was able to experience a whole new world with creating this application, for many to use.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Ophelia - The RPG Horror Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ophelia - The RPG Horror Game \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/235/210/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We had played RPG games before, specifically of the horror variety, and wanted to try creating one ourselves based on what we know about them. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>You navigate your character, Ace, using the right and left button keys.

It is very basic, but it can be interesting. Each cell is represented at the right of the screen as a square - they are in a 5x5 grid. Each one can send a binary (yes or no) input to each of its neighbors - yes being represented by a green triangle pointing at that neighbor. The cell has a different response to each combination of inputs. When you launch the program, it sets all of these to random values.</p>\n<p>Four cells are \"input cells\" - they output all true or all false to their neighbors based on a property in the virtual world that this \"brain\" is acting in. The brain controls a dot in the left side of the screen. The \"input cells\" go on when the dot goes too far up, down, left, or right respectively. If it goes ever further, the program starts \"killing\" cells - it sets them to new random behaviors, one cell per frame. Along with the input cells, there are four output cells - one of their sides makes the dot move up, down, left, or right respectively instead of giving input to another cell. Eventually, the cells interacting and being reborn can create patterns that stay inside the acceptable area. In order to see this more easily, I included some keyboard functions-</p>\n<p>-spacebar to speed up or slow down - in \"fast mode\", the program will run as fast as it can; in \"slow mode\", it will run at four frames per second.<br/>\n-P to pause<br/>\n-O to draw a trail of where the dot has been, instead of just drawing its current position. Pressing O again changes back.</p>\n<p>Because the program runs at four frames per second, you will have to hold these buttons for a while before they work.</p>\n<p>For analysis, the program exports a csv file called \"position.csv\" of the x and y coordinates of the white dot at every frame. The coordinate plane goes from (-50, -50) to (50,50). If the white dot goes past the edge of the screen, it goes to the other side (wrapped screen).</p>\n<p>If you enable trail drawing, you may see patterns that last for a short amount of time before the dot goes back to moving chaotically. If you don't see anything happening, the brain may have formed a \"stable pattern\" that it will continue until you close the program.</p>\n<p>You will notice some white lines in the area with the white dot. The middle set are used to trigger the \"input cells\", and the outer set are used to trigger \"brain damage\" (cells are randomly reprogrammed).</p>\n<p>It is difficult for the program to come up with a stable pattern; I found that actually manually programming a working pattern was very complex. If you hold the T button, it will reprogram the brain to this pattern. However, it will probably only work if the dot is within the middle set of white lines - these are used to trigger the \"input cells\".</p>\n<p>To launch, extract the folder and double click on \"Brain Simulator.bat\".

The user can then identify who has the lowest kda in the past games and who is most likely to go on \"tilt\" if you focus on killing them in the game.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Lots of debugging and difficulty initially figuring out how to use the API. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It works and can give the player using the program knowledge of the enemy team before the game starts, increaing the win percentage.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to use JavaScript and API</p>\n<h2>What's next for weakestlink</h2>\n<p>for the getTiltScore function, adding more variable that would change the TiltScore for the player</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Hadionoo/weakestlink\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Hadionoo/weakestlink\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Time Para-Traveler", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Time Para-Traveler \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/235/155/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Time Para-Traveler \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/235/154/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Time Para-Traveler \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/235/153/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you learned about the theory of Time Paradox before? If a man returns to the past, marries a woman and gets a son who is actually himself in the past, then, who is the actual father of a man? We wish to let our players have a feeling of such time rule. Thus, we combine the idea of both maze and time together and form a new programming idea called Time Para-Traveler. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Within the gaming program, it is automatically set that the players won\u2019t be able to get the exit under limited time. So we give a chance to the players with something called Time Machine in between the way out to the exit. After the players arrives Time Machine\u2019s location, he will be provided the same amount of time that he used to travel from entrance to Time Machine in order to get out of the maze. (In this case, we make the player return back to the beginning time at Time Machine location) Meanwhile, there is a shadow of the player in the entrance starting to going through the same routine the player has gone through. Then, the player would have another task \u2013 to avoid being in the eyesight of that shadow. Also, the game will provide other toolkits and monsters to enhance the level of entertainment. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>When I don't know how to use multi thread, I have to think of a way to use single thread to complete the project because I have to control both the now-me and past-me so that the game is runnable.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Unlike Javascript and Html, Java code actually has more challenges when it comes to visual aid. So using mere GUI from Java to complete a program is a proud accomplishment for a beginner team. Meanwhile, we've tons of images through drawing and editing of pixel art and background images to beautify our prototype.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our group members learned animation skill learned and strengthened our reasoning skill in one night. Assigning the roles to each member with their distinctive personalities and abilities is another effective part. And programming is fun!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Time Para-Traveler</h2>\n<p>Open the stage to the multi-players online; Open harder levels of mazes; Insert more monsters and obstacles into the maze to have more fun; Open the bigger platform in Android.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jgrasp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-flash\">adobe-flash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["EventFace", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>Well 4/5 team members are completely new to hackathons and we decided to start with something simple</h2>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<h2>The Iphone app \"ARWatch\" scans a QR like code and replicates the Apple Watch.

Finger tutting is a type of dance that involves intricate movements of the fingers.The word \"tutting\" refers to use of angular movements reminiscent of Egyptian hieroglyphics. It become integrated into modern hip hop only a few years ago.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Basically, I made part of the code on Open Scad in such a way that people would be modifying individual values that correspond to different lengths depending on their hand size, instead of the actual CAD file. It provides as many right angles that 4 hands or 2 partners in heavily tutting dance would provide for variation because it has so many right angles within the 3-D figure</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Two 3-D printers have been off and on having problems so the wait is too long for me to 3-D print my design. On top of this my accelerated virtulization I had been using for VM's has been screwing with my CAD software. So for now, I had to create the finished project on Google Sketchup which I had very little experience with before. Also this was my first time editing STL files on my own. All in all, I learned about 3-d printing concepts, more importantly its weaknesses and restraints.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I want to slowly create some kind of bridge between my two loves of dance and engineering.

Meaning that we all came to hackBCA with ideas, but without team mates. After we found each other in the lower cafe, we decided to make a website that would allow people with similar interests from the same region to come together to work on a project. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Many people have ideas but lack a team, and so users have the option to upload their project idea and contact information on a specific topic, and other users of the website can contact this person. Other people have a passion on a said interest (i.e comp sci, activism etc), but don't have a project to contribute to. All users will get started by filling out a survey that directs these users to chat rooms with people who have similar interests and come from the same region, this way users can get together with others who share their same passion and initiative. There is also an inspiration tab for those who have a passion and lack an idea.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Thirty minutes before the submission github mistook us for a \"robot\" and we had to reenter our ENTIRE repository.\nWe had much difficulty getting the user to upload files form their own computer and get this doc onto the web, because we lacked any knowledge in Parse, a server, and in fact didn't even know what servers were before the hackathon. In developing other features of our website, we had to make use of programming languages we had no prior knowledge of (jQuery, javascript, etc.), as introduction comp sci students, we also had to learn about objects and object oriented programming. In addition we were also unfamiliar with the process of hackathons. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of how far we have gone as beginner programmers (i.e figuring out chat and uploads via parse). When we first came to this hackathon, we had very minimal programming experience; we didn't know how to use a variety of programming languages &amp; how to work socially in terms of programming. We had to familiarize ourselves with github. And thanks to all of this, we have become pros at documentation/SDK reading.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Parse, javascript, jquery, servers, python, object-oriented, IOS development (workshop), \"social\" programming, reading documentation/SDK and how to trouble shoot with git hub. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Project Connect</h2>\n<p>We would like to add log in feature and integrate profiles with personal chat so that previous chats can be saved. And possibly turn Project Connect into an international programming. Since we all come from different towns, and a few of us from different counties, we plan on having a weekly Skype meet up on Saturdays 4:00 - 5:30. After we achieve all of these improvements, we plant to advertise our product. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">object-oriented</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">upload</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stack-overflow\">stack-overflow</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sdk</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://projectconnectus.github.io/ProjectConnectUS/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://projectconnectus.github.io/ProjectConnectUS/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>projectconnectus.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["jefs", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Wat?</h2>\n<p>jefs is a file system that automatically sorts all your files into folders.

We brainstormed possible solutions and existing solutions and recognized that everything that existed was forced to a specific operating system or costed a large amount of money. With this tool we were able to successfully have the same track broadcast across multiple operating systems to create one coherent speaker.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>BeatSync is a multi part program branching into many languages to create an overall product. We use a node backend as the core executor, a custom python server for providing song streaming and a searching API. The front end uses an angular base with a custom bootstrap theme to give it its style. Finally, all come together using python libraries to synchronize the clients and server. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The major challenge we ran into was with ensuring that all of the streams were synchronized. Even a minute difference in timing could have a significant affect on the overall product. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are the most proud of the fact we were able to pull of a huge feat that required a lot of dedication. Clock syncing to make multiple computers that can function as one large speaker required a lot of networking knowledge and prior research before we were able to begin coding. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>There was a lot each team member learned from the project. Brandon, one of the python devs, learned how to integrate several API servers to create an overall song search algorithm and streamer service. Sadat, another python dev, learned how to implemented several different networking protocols to create a efficient streaming service. Victor, the front-end dev and node dev, learned how to synchronize clients and servers to create a speaker that plays in unison over the internet.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BeatSync</h2>\n<p>We plan on making this an actual service people can use for recreational events, gatherings and personal use. We also plan on adding the ability to create multiple playlists and import their existing playlists from other services. Finally, we would like to port our User Interface to mobile so we can support a wider range of devices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/soundcloud\">soundcloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/youtube\">youtube</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/beatsync\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/beatsync\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Robert's Website on Random Things", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I wanted to create a website that would be pretty easy to use and would be simple for other people to use.\n## How it works\n\n<ul>\n<li>It is just a single spaced web page \n## Challenges I ran into</li>\n<li>The CSS was hard at first and Java was very unfamiliar\n## Accomplishments that I'm proud of</li>\n<li>The fact that I actually finished my first website ever, it has given me confidence\n## What I learned</li>\n<li>I learned how to ask questions with Java and I learned CSS components\n## What's next for Robert's First Website</li>\n<li>Probably will make \"Roberts Second Website\"</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://my-first-website-brinker1999.c9.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://my-first-website-brinker1999.c9.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>my-first-website-brinker1999.c9.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Pioneers ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pioneers  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/234/773/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As a person who honestly enjoys the idea of a nonprofit for the good of the community, Pioneers was an application i had to build.

People with disabilities can push either emergency button if they are ill or injured, rather than having to go through the painful struggle of finding the phone and reaching for it on their own. Additionally, they can push a weather button to pull up the local weather data on their personal computer. This is much easier than having to travel to the computer, log in, and search for the weather - especially for patients who have trouble interfacing with digital technology.</p>\n<p>We believe that SmartHands is an innovative way to assist people who have to overcome physical disabilities on a daily basis. We hope that other software and hardware developers will continue to apply the idea of push-of-a-button technology in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sendgrid\">sendgrid</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">weather</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/shaantamchawla/SmartHands\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/shaantamchawla/SmartHands\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the frontend and backend for the SmartHands companion web application.

They want to know when they are due, or more specifically, how many days they have to procrastinate until they must turn in the assignment. On the other hand,  students who plan their schedule several months ahead don't enjoy it when due dates change and when they have to go through each of their apps to switch around their schedule, just to wait for it to get messed up again. fakeSchool provides a solution to the communication problem between teachers and students, whether it be about the next class, not the next semester, fakeSchool aspires to make everything clear.  </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>fakeSchool's primary purpose is to bring together all the essentials into one simple and easy to use app. It first extensively uses MongoDB to establish a secure network of administrators, teachers, and students. A unique feature of fakeSchool is that tasks are stored independently of their creator, which makes it extremely easy to make mass changes to a single activity that affects a lot of people since each user stores a reference to the task rather than the task itself. fakeSchool uses node's passport module for local authentication and will soon use Oauth2 to utilize the google products. When a school cancelation is announced, the administrator will broadcast it to the school network and all assignments will automatically moved back by a predetermined amount, set by either the administration or a teacher. Additionally, any task that is changed by a teacher will immediately be shown to the students and will be changed in all the students registered google services, behind the scenes. No extra effort, no confusion, more learning. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Once I had configured the database and api to perform the way they should, I found myself short on time to create the front-end.

We are also fairly proud of our 3D models and our first major attempt at creating something notable in Unity.
