We've gotten pretty good at designing the landscape but an environment can be pretty barren without life. Unfortunately adding life to a game is a difficult trial and error task. Something we didn't want to spend all our time doing. Our software allows us to animate lifeless 3d models with simulated brains and unleash a population into our created environment to learn to survive and thrive in whatever way we see fit.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It learns to master its environment. Using a genetically encoded population of simulated brains the software will discover the best decision making process to do what the user requests as best as it can.

With this comes a huge opening for innovative techniques in daily living and even physical therapy. </p>\n<p>My grandfather suffered from a hemorrhagic stroke a few years ago and never recovered from his accident. One reason he is now bedridden is because he refused to go to therapy and wanted to stay home instead. If he would have had the devices and program we have today he might be living a completely different and improved life. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Virtual Therapy allows patients, such as stroke victims, to perform exercises in a more modern and fun way than the usual physical therapy exercises. We mirrored exercises such as the basic hand motion of making a fist then releasing we mirrored this action by making a virtual game of grabbing apples from a trees. We also used different colors of apples to help stimulate brain function. We did this with several of the arm, wrist and hand exercises performed in physical therapy.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used blender to create rooms and objects and put it all together using unity. We used Oculus and the leap motion device to make the experience virtual to the patient.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a major set up problem when we realized we had the wrong connections to the monitor and computer. We also ran into a few minor unity problems and blender problems.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we created a project that can simulate a virtual world and the ability to see our hands in the world. We have a few working demo levels and through our research we have found that even those might be helpful to people.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that details are crucial. We also learned a lot about Unity and Blender while making the little parts. We lastly learned how awesome Oculus and Leap Motion are. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Virtual Therapy</h2>\n<p>Next we can try to add voice stimulation for speech therapy, possibly commands for neurological stimulation, and also a way to include leg therapy into the virtual world, as of right now just the arms are working, </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/patrickedelen/VirtualTherapy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/patrickedelen/VirtualTherapy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Oculus/Leap integration and some level design.", "I made models in blender and incorporated them into unity.

Everytime I go there I get confused looking at the menu. I try to read the name and visualize the dishes but the names just dont make any sense to me. So I call the server and start asking him about the dishes one by one or I google search for images of the dishes before making a choice. This got me into thinking what if I dont have to manually search each item or disturb the server so many times.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It uses OCR technology to augment the menu and scan the text(dishes). Then it gives information such as images, country of origin of the dish and ingredients of the dish.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Foodie is an android app that uses Google's OCR packages to detect text among images available on Mobile Vision. The application fetches information about the dishes by querying the back-end. Back end is made using Flask and Google Knowledge Graph API and Duck Duck Go API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Google's OCR packages are complex and it took some time to understand how those packages work. Once information is read from stream of camera frames, the next challenge was to process text and send it to the server. We spent some time figuring out how to send cross-domain requests. Finding the right API was a challenge as most of the search platforms are not open source. There was a steep learning curve for Python-Flask application framework. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Lots' of learning was involved be it Google's OCR technology, Python-Flask framework and back-end Duck Duck Go API. We are glad to complete the app in the given time.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Google's OCR technology, Python-Flask, Duck Duck Go API but most importantly time management, team work, spontaneity and creativity !</p>\n<h2>What's next for Foodie</h2>\n<p>Proposal: It would be nice to integrate Foodie into wearable devices such as Google Glass and see where we go from there...</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jugg3rn4u7/Foodie\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jugg3rn4u7/Foodie\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Front-end of the app (Android).

Although there are many nice people on the internet, there are many who are not and turn to cyberbullying -- an unacceptable act that must be dealt with.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to reduce and ultimately eliminate online harassment by creating a bot that can help solve this issue while also spreading online harassment awareness. This bot will be created to monitor and deal with encounters of harassment on reddit.com, but could eventually be used on other websites assuming the websites allows anti-bullying bots.</p>\n<p>This bot will primarily deal with the prevention of online harassment by tackling the issues of the following: mob mentality (where a small number of users create a bullying avalanche effect), doxing (where users publish private or identifying information about a particular individual on the internet), and documentation (recording the instances in which a user is harassed).</p>\n<p>Design:</p>\n<p>The bot is created by using the Reddit API called praw. The bot logs into reddit.com and continuously runs the program.</p>\n<p>In order to address mob mentality, the bot first pulls posts from the \u201chot\u201d filter tab at the top of the page, which has posts in sorted from most popular to least popular (note: the code can be changed to look at all posts on reddit.com). Then, the bot iterates through each post and comment and detects if a comment is personal information (address, phone number, email address). If the comment is deemed as containing personal information (containing an address and either a phone number and an email address), the comment will be reported and a .txt file of the incident will be generated with the time, username of the harasser, why the comment was flagged, and the original comment. Additionally, the user will be sent a private message alerting that they have posted personal information to a reddit post, and explaining that cyberbulling is not acceptable and provide a link to take the pledge to create a more safe, harassment-free world.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the bot also runs a tone detection on the comments through the use of IBM\u2019s Watson Tone Detection API. If the tone of a comment exceeds the \u201canger\u201d and/or \u201cdisgust\u201d threshold established, then the bot will auto-comment a paragraph explaining that bullying is not acceptable through any forms of media. Through this function, the \u201cmob mentality\u201d that occurs on online forums, such as Reddit, will be prevented by reminding users that such negative behavior is unacceptable and that online users are people.</p>\n<p>Summary</p>\n<p>This proof-of concept application of the anti-bullying bot successfully monitors and deals with situations of online harassment by running continuouly. It is known that many major social media websites do not allow bots, though perhaps this is something websites should begin to consider. For now, APIs such as IBM\u2019s Tone Detection API could be used to study and analyze the data of cyberbullying to develop efficient and effective ways of combating harassment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pycharm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/reddit\">reddit</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/christianortega123/tamu_hack_2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/christianortega123/tamu_hack_2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Pear", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our inspiration, as freshmen, was the difficult experience of having less opportunity to connect to the diverse group of people available of a college campus.

I would say that building motives that were new and sufficiently different was the most difficult challenge here. The next biggest difficulty was mixing the various instruments together to sound good without overpowering each other.

You want to go around and explore the town a bit, or do some of the really cool local stuff.  More than often, you might just choose to stay in your hotel because it can be boring to do things alone.  What about an app that helps you find people to wander with, people who are interested in the same thing? No planning, no scheduling nothing, no strings. Impromptu, just the way a nice fun outing should be.     *</em></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app perfectly captures the idea of having less time in hand when we visit a place for a short stay and having enough of time to get bored at the hotel. So, why not have some one to explore the vicinity around you and with you. The app takes the activities and places of interest from all the users who have checked in to the place during the last 24 hours. The idea of the app is to suggest travel buddies to the users on the fly within minimum clicks. As the app doesn't require any prior planning about the tour, it becomes really easy for the user to get 'WanderWith' buddies. The app incorporates login with Facebook to maintain the authenticity of the users and in future, Facebook profile information can be used to know about the interests of the user so that we can pro actively suggest potential places to the user with new check in. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We began by experimenting with Amazon and Google's cloud platforms, and managed to set up a Compute Engine as well as a CloudSQL instance, but later realized that it would be better idea to set up a basic development server first, after which we moved to our local TAMU servers. We used the AJAX + Django stack to build our webapp, as many users tend to prefer websites over apps, to avoid over-cluttering their mobile phones. We had a couple of members working on Bootstrap to build a interactive UI, as well as Javascript code to communicate with our Python backend. We used Facebook for authentication, and also as a means of identification. The other members focused on writing backend code to execute recommendation algorithms and database interfacing.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We faced numerous challenges while coming up with the basic prototype of the app idea. We tried to deploy our application on Google Cloud and make a domain name on MLH but the deployment on google cloud took unnecessary time and the MLH domain name didn't get activated till now. We began by having a vision of very intense app idea but it turned out that we had a very tight time frame and we ended up implementing the minimum viable application that can perfectly capture our idea.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We pitched our idea to many of our co-hackers, and they all agreed that there is immense scope to solve such a problem, and monetize it over the long run. Most of us have faced this problem, especially when going to a new city for an internship, on-site interview or meeting in cities such as New York, Seattle and Austin. While most current apps attempt to unite travelers via prior planning and travel coordination, our app tries to retain the charm of impromptu planning by allowing the users to search for 'co-wanderers' as and when they feel like it, and find time in a new city. It is hard to make an app that depends on such simplistic user input and interaction, and yet can solve a very crucial and challenging problem faced by many all over the world. We believe we have been able to come up with such a minimalistic design that can capture just enough data to link up the user with potential travel partners.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How to convert a raw idea into a minimum viable product, and come up with minimalistic design that will help us pitch it.</li>\n<li>The usage of cloud services and various new web APIs, which are powerful beyond imagination, and need to be handled carefully, simply because there are so many of them.</li>\n<li>Dealing with the trade-off between fixing minor bugs and pushing to add more features in the short time span.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for WanderWith</h2>\n<p>WanderWith has a tremendous scope to be scaled up to the level where the suggestions can be made using Machine Learning techniques like Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization and Recommendation System Models. WanderWith can further make use of Facebook Graph API and give preferences to local experts and friends while making suggestions. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://srl-prod2.cs.tamu.edu/html/wanderwith\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://srl-prod2.cs.tamu.edu/html/wanderwith\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>srl-prod2.cs.tamu.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["TripTunes", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TripTunes \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/482/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanting to have dynamic playlists that take advantage of existing google and spotify APIs.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It uses spotify's artist profiles and people's location to generate a list of songs my artists that grew up near the user's current location.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Android Studio, lots of tutorials</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>What are APIs, what is Android Studio.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The logo.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for TripTunes</h2>\n<p>Actually figuring out how to finish it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/karlsolomon/TripTunes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/karlsolomon/TripTunes/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Trump Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The ridiculousness of the 2016 political election.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Demonstrates <strong>Poe's Law</strong> in action.

Music is incredibly structured -- in fact, it's widely considered a Mildly Context Sensitive Language.  I wanted to exploit music's inherent structure to find a some musical representation with an interesting and unexpected utility.  I decided to utilize chord analysis to create a one-to-one mapping from chord progressions to text.  With this, any musician can write a novel, a program, a blog, or just see what their favorite songs look like under their favorite mapping!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Music2Text does just what it sounds like: using real time audio input, Music2Text can turn any chord progression into writing.  Music2Text focuses on chord transitions as a mapping system, such that any transition from one chord to the next results in a text output.  Musicians can use an existing mapping or create their own.  Music2Text is multithreaded, partitioning tasks into stages, yielding fast translations from music to text.   </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using portaudio in C++, Music2Text reads in raw audio from a USB midi device.  This data is then analyzed using a fast fourier transform, yielding a Chromagram, which consists of the intensities of the twelve tones in the Western scale.  A Chord Detector analyzes the Chromagram to determine the likeliest chord given the frequency distribution of the sample.  After determining what chord has been played, a queue keeps track of the chord changes (keeping their order).  A chord-transition to string map is initialized from a file, and the program determines which strings to print out based on the order of notes emerging from the queue.  The process continues in real time, translating chord transitions as they are played.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was the first time I've used any sort of driver API, so the learning curve kept progress slow.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Currently, this type of music to text mapping exists only for MIDI devices, the data out of which are easy to parse through.  I am proud that I successfully tackled the challenge of doing the same task with audio -- this way, ANY instrument can be used to create text.  I also feel I connected well with other hackers here: with some instruments here to help me with my project, I found some great musicians to play with throughout the night.  After completing a hack that I'm extremely proud of and also having some great jam sessions, this turned out to be my favorite hackathon so far!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about audio processing!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Music2Text</h2>\n<p>Better mappings: the key to a successful version of this project is a very useful and sensible mapping from chord transition to string.  Incorporating chord qualities (major, minor, extra harmonies, etc) will be key in this.  Also, I'd like to be able to map chord transitions to midi inputs that can be piped to the keyboard port -- with this, Music2Text can be used in any text editor!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">postaudio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chord-detector-and-chromagram</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Twitter Fantasy League", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Fantasy league game addicts, here is a game for you with a small twist!!!

We have created a fantasy team based on professional sports players you choose from a particular sport and it accordingly checks their mentions on twitter for a game span of 30secs within an interval of 2secs each. You will have a wide variety of sports to select varying from football, basketball, baseball and soccer.\nHaving fun playing the game? Why stop there?

Pokemon go was released a few months and cerated a huge spike in interest in Augmented Reality. The original idea was to find your parked car using AR, but I felt like I should challenge myself and built a restaurant/cafe finder!</p>\n<p>The concept in general goes a long way. Image a student who can't find their class on the first day of school. Simply open the phone and look around. The same goes for parking, finding stores in a mall, etc.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Open the app to find restaurants near you. Hitting the Googles button will open a camera, displaying info about each building you see and your environment around you.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built this using Android mainly because I've been doing a ton of Node and iOS lately. I used a camera vision library to apply Augmented Reality and connected to the Google Places api to get the points of interest.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Augmented reality was a huge pain, but a great payoff. I spend over 4 hours finding the right resources and libraries need, also learning about the concept in general.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I did something with camera vision. I had time to play with things like fake detection and 3d mapping, so I will definitely research more of this in the future.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I haven't done an Android in while so it was fun to get back into it. I learned at ton this hackathon, things like Augmented Reality and Retrofit (An http library, i'm used to Volley).</p>\n<h2>What's next for dinAR</h2>\n<p>I think dinAR is a great concept, and I would love to make a much better algorithm for the Augmented Reality. The current  library has a poor use of matrix projections and accelerometer uses. I would love for it to be as nice as Pokemon Go.</p>\n<p>On top of that, this would be a general</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">retrofit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">picaso</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/augmented-reality\">augmented-reality</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">camera-vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material-design</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cameronmoreau/ARYelp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cameronmoreau/ARYelp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["pickAspot4me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: We are tired of not being able to choose a place to go eat because there are so many around.

After figuring out how to communicate the mobile app to the server we just had to get the right information sent back and forth between the clients and the server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into many issues of crashing the server with incorrect input and null pointers. Developing the main algorithm that matched users in a geographic radius of each other was a very challenging but also very rewarding part of our project. Also a lot of the hackathon was basically spent learning the Android Studio environment and getting simple things such as radio buttons and lists to work.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of the fact that an idea I thought of during class became a reality in less than 24 hours! For having no prior Android Development experience I am very happy with what we hacked together.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to make the mobile application and an Apache web server communicate. As well as very basic components of Android Studio. Vasilis learned how to use python cgi for the back-end development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for College Ride Share</h2>\n<p>The name of the application still needs some work, so the name of the app would definitely change in the future.</p>\n<p>The next step for College Ride Share development-wise is to add the \"Request a Ride\" feature which will let you put in your current location and where you want to go and at what time. This will then try to match you up with someone that wants to go to the same place at a similar time.</p>\n<p>There are also plans to add an incentive system(points/rewards) to get drivers to want to use the app and help those without transportation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean\">digitalocean</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jkcoolsville/RideShare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jkcoolsville/RideShare\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the server backend of the app.", ""]], ["FarkleNation", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FarkleNation \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/193/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I always lose against my friends when playing farkle so in order to never lose again I created an AI to help me win everytime.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows the user to input his or her current situation in the dice game Farkle and uses statistics to recommend the best possible move</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using the Android API and Data structures, we created a program that runs the statistics to recommend the best move</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Debugging and Designs</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Debugging, Creating a Weak AI, The Design of the App</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to design an App, How to use data structures, how to debug properly.</p>\n<h2>What's next for FarkleNation</h2>\n<p>Allow you to play against the AI and Play with your friends</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I helped design,debug, and analyze the app", ""]], ["Hullabaloo Connect-Connect", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hullabaloo Connect-Connect \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/139/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Welcome Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hullabaloo Connect-Connect \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/184/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Full Screen View</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hullabaloo Connect-Connect \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/140/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Chat View and Canvas</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Hullabaloo Connect-Connect was a result of society's desire to communicate with peers and mentors in both a casual yet professional environment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This web application, using a \"room\" model, allows people to easily setup chat rooms, where they can both draw on a shared canvas as well as chat about these drawing.

After lots of brainstorming, we wanted to do something with exoplanets, as neither of us specialize in exoplanetary astrophysics, but it is an exciting and rapidly-growing subfield in public perception.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We found API of all confirmed exoplanets as of Sept 29th, 2016 and scraped it. Using this data, we were able to determine the positions of each confirmed exoplanet on the sky, as well is its distance, and the properties of its host star and its orbit. Now, you can use VirtualSky to not only view the positions of our solar system bodies, stars, and constellations interactively at any given date, time, and position on the Earth, but now you can see the positions of all confirmed exoplanets (all ~3400 of them!) at the same time!\nYou can also choose to sort which exoplanets you can see. Exoplanets discovered by stellar transits (by passing in front of their host star and causing a dip in brightness), radial velocity measurements (measuring the minute changes in the host star's spectrum from the planet's gravitational pull on it, causing periodic redshifts and blueshifts), gravitational microlensing (the gravity from the planet distorting the light of the host star based on Einstein's law of General Relativity), and direct imaging (taking a picture of it!), can all be plotted on the sky individually or at the same time, in different colors. You can also click on each planet to be taken to a webpage with its properties on \n<a href=\"http://www.openexoplanetcatalogue.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Exoplanet Catalogue</a>.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the existing VirtualSky platform and built onto it. VirtualSky is a browser-based code that plots the positions of solar system objects and stars at any given date, time, and position on the Earth, and allows you to move your field of view interactively spatially and temporally. We modified this code to allow us to plot other objects of our choosing.\nWe found our exoplanet information on <a href=\"https://github.com/openexoplanetcatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/openexoplanetcatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue/</a>. Using this information we were able to determine all positions and put it into a readable format for our code. We were also able to, based on host star properties such as distance from the Earth and surface Temperature, able to determine a relative brightness system so that all objects would be easy to view, but distant or faint objects would appear smaller. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had to understand the viewer and how it worked in order to change it, with little direction or documentation. The data were also incomplete in places and we needed to figure out how to work with this data to make it viewable.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We put in an easter egg involving the infamous Octocat :)\nWe also got our idea to work, and we were actually able to pick out exactly where the most intense surveys were conducted on the sky. It's fun seeing the Kepler observations in such detail!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We didn't know the variety of detection methods was so diverse! There were far more radial velocity detections than we thought, and over such a range of the sky! We also didn't know there were so many microlensing events detected.

Once all parts have been rated, the user may 'breed' the next generation of music. This is done by breeding highly rated sections of the composition with other highly rated sections. In this way, the best sounding sections of the composition will influence the future of the piece.

At the beginning of the hackathon, both members of the teams took a pledge to help stop online harassment. One of the hack challenges that was presented was to incorporate the pledge we took into a hack, and this seemed like a good fit with our adventure story.  We decided our target audience would be elementary school children. </p>\n<p>The story's start page was inspired by the famous Carl Sagan quote, \"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\"  This allowed us to have a launch pad from which to start our story.  It was thought that various story branches could be created, all of which end in the main character finding apple pie of some-sort. Along the way, the main character could also encounter challenges that deal with different aspects of online harassment, and present a positive way of dealing with this kind of negative behavior. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our hack is a functioning website that allows the user to select various story paths.  It is an education platform to help teach young children about online harassment.  Instead of your typical online scenario based training, our website aims to create fictional scenarios to engage imagination and inform kids in a more fun way about online harassment.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The program was built using html and css.

After learning the basic ideas of how they work from a basic board, we happened across a Smart Glove implemented with Arduino Yun to detect data input from the hand. After trying to integrate the hardware with Alex, we realized certain gestures could be interpreted. This led us to decide to create a drum player application that could utilize the data received from the hand gestures/movement to simulate actually playing the drums.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This hack interprets a user's hand gesture/movements when wearing the Smart Glove into drum set sounds. This includes a bass drum, snare drum, and crash cymbal.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Implemented with Arduino code to turn Smart Glove data into JSON format, Python to reformat the data into a file, and Java to read from that file, play sound, react to certain key events, and have data visualization. By pipelining the outputs of the file created by Python, we took the raw data and calculated the gestures and signals based on pressure, change in acceleration, flexing of the fingers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning smart glove + Arduino Yun code, finding key event moments out of data analysis, and playing sound in multiple instances without repeats.</p>\n<p>Finding the calculation of the g-force for the smart glove for only a certain subset of data was difficult, since the rest of the data was considered jitter data, and was useless for our implementation.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Figuring out how to work with Arduino code, taking data and putting it out in a human-readable format, being able to recognize certain gestures, and register signals and play sound in multiple instances.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the steps of how an external hardware device communicates to the computer through data visualization, analysis, and providing events through data analysis. Additionally, we learned how to handle and play multiple instances of similar and unique sounds at given events. Most of all, we were able create a working demo that can be used for its application.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AirDrum?</h2>\n<p>The next step would be to further enhance data visualization, add additional  gestures to the application, and integrate it with Rock Band so users can interact and play Rock Band without a drum set.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">smart-glove</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theCreedo/AirDrumTamu2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/theCreedo/AirDrumTamu2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on Java", "", "", ""]], ["TravelDiary", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TravelDiary \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/408/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Splash Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TravelDiary \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/407/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Main page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make an app that provides a short info about a beautiful city of College Station so that user can take notes and edit them on the fly!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Provides a short info about a beautiful city of College Station with all notes taken during the trip around the city.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This is an iOS app built for iPhone 6 and 6s using swift and Alamofire netwrking framework.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>-Scrollview not responding properly in Xcode\n-Constrain layout issues</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It actually works!
