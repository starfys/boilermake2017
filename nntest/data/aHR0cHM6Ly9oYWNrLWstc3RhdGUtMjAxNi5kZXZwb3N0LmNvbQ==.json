This uses a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN), which trains a model to predict the 30-day re-admittance of a patient. The DNN is built using the TensorFlow machine learning library for Python 3.5. The DNN has hidden two layers. The first hidden layer has 50 nodes, while the second hidden layer has 20 nodes. After training the model, a separate Python script is able to load the pre-trained model at-will and use it to predict for a single patient's data.</p>\n<p>We have created a webpage (joshriess.tech) for health care professionals to more easily access the predictive capacities of the DNN model. This webpage allows for input of a patient's data and quick prediction. In order to accomplish this, the HTML input is pre-processed by PHP and passed as arguments into the Python evaluation script, where it is further processed and validated before use with TensorFlow. The final prediction is passed to PHP along with an identification string. PHP then identifies the final result and notifies the user.</p>\n<p>Note: joshriess.tech may be password-protected at this time.</p>\n<p>All products are in a prototype stage.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">python-3.5</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scipy\">scipy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tf.learn</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">deep-neural-network</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/greasypenguins/purple-hats\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/greasypenguins/purple-hats\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built and trained the deep neural network model.

We wanted to do data analysis.</p>\n<p>The K-State SIGAI Group proposed a challenge. We want to use data science for the betterment of society. In order to combine these ideas, we concocted BetterDAI, an end to end data pipeline that betters the world. </p>\n<p>Our goal was to predict which patients will be re-admitted to the hospital within 30 days of their discharge. This is a real problem for hospitals, who don't get paid for a re-admission if it happens within 30 days after the patient was discharged, and patients, who would like to live their life outside the walls of a hospital and be healthy.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>BetterDAI is a state of the art end to end pipeline that uses Python, Django, Sqlite, Twilio, DigitalOcean, Bootstrap, R, and Machine Learning. </p>\n<p>Doctors insert data about all their patients into the form on the web application. This information is stored in a database. (almost)</p>\n<p>The patient data stored in the database is then prepared and cleaned in order to pass it to our predictive model. The model predicts whether a patient has a high likelihood of being readmitted to the hospital within the next 30 days (that makes for a bad day). Our predictive model has an ensemble of analysis techniques used in order to ensure the highest precision (that makes for a better day).</p>\n<p>Once the model has done its work, the doctor has access to top of the line analytics to help him make a decision in releasing a patient. (see more in the how we applied machine learning and prediction)</p>\n<p>BetterDAI collects data, cleans it, processes it, and delivers it back with useful information. The full stack. The pipeline. The end to end solution for doctors everywhere. It is data science for good!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used django to create a web application in python.</p>\n<p>We hosted our app on DigitalOcean using a domain from domain.com, <a href=\"http://betterdai.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>.</p>\n<p>We used the Twilio API because we thought it was cool.</p>\n<p>We used sqlite database to store information about the patients.</p>\n<h2>How to apply Machine Learning</h2>\n<p>What preprocessing and supervised learning methods did you use?\npreprocessing:\n1, remove constant features\n2, factorize categorical features\n3, impute NAs\n4, on-hot-encoding for categorical features and low-level numerical features\n5, create num of NAs feature</p>\n<p>first level models:\n1*glmnet(logistic regression)\n2*Ranger(random forest)<br/>\n2*XGBoost(boosting)</p>\n<p>stacking model: glmnet</p>\n<p>strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First do exploratory data analysis and data visualization to understand the data,\nwhich is important for find suitable models later on.</li>\n<li>Establish solid cross-validation scheme before any feature engineering and modeling</li>\n<li>Different model to diversity the prediction, beneficial for ensemble</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into/ Hacks we made</h2>\n<p><strong>DJANGO</strong></p>\n<p>Static files within Django.

Parents may ask their child what they did in school that day. However, students won't necessarily be able to give all the detail that the parents want to know, such as assigned homework, due dates, and behavior.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Classify fixes this by closing the distance between parents and the classroom. When a teacher sees a student doing something good or bad, he/she can ask Alexa to give or remove a student's points. The student's total points are then showed on <a href=\"http://www.echoclassify.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.echoclassify.tech</a> for parents to view. Parents can also view all of the assignments (with due dates) that the teacher added using an Amazon Echo. This will allow them to help their child complete their assignments on time. In addition to all of this, if a parent has any concerns about why their child has the point total they have, or wants more information about an assignment, he/she can send an email to the teacher directly off of our website. If a student rises above or falls below a certain point value a text will automatically be sent to the student's parents. Texts will also be sent to parents every time an assignment is created or removed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team used an Amazon Echo in conjunction with Amazon Web Services Lambda to send points and assignments to Parse Server. Then, <a href=\"http://www.echoclassify.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.echoclassify.tech</a> retrieved data from Parse to show it on the website. Twilio was used with Amazon Web Services to send all of the texts. Using emailjs, we were able to allow parents to send emails to the teacher directly off the website.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since no one on our team was familiar with AWS Lambda or the Amazon Echo in general, a lot of time was spent learning and making mistakes. In addition to Amazon-related issues, we encountered other obstacles, including sending texts with Twilio and using HTML Canvas</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are extremely proud of how we helped each other solve issues on subjects that were foreign to all of us just 2 days ago. Being able to hack on new hardware and using new languages certainly provided for a challenge, but we were able to reach our goals and have fun the whole time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Cumulatively, our team learned Javascript, AWS Lambda, Twilio, and Alexa voice service.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Classify</h2>\n<p>Classify can be expanded to create a more comprehensive classroom system. Although Classify is currently directed towards elementary-age children, other features will make it more adaptable to various educational levels.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">emailjs</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BeijingStrongbow/classify\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BeijingStrongbow/classify\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I took the processed data and connected it with our parse data base.

Our program uses Leap Motion's functionality to simulate playing 4-wall handball. The objective of handball is to hit the ball against the back wall before the ball can bounce twice on the ground. Handball Simulator currently does not support two players, so the game is more of a challenge to keep the ball off the ground for as long as possible and a demonstration of how Leap Motion can work with physics engines. The game requires two people to run: one person to control the view and the movement of the player, and one to control the hands of the player.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Hand-Ball Simulator combines the available assets for adding simulated hands to a unity project together with a physics engine to create a virtualization of the game of Handball.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>None of us had any previous experience with Leap Motion and most of us had very limited experience with Unity, so a majority of our time was figuring out how to add objects to the world and interact with those objects. The Leap Motion SDK is not widely used so we ran into several problems that did not have well documented solutions. One of these problems was that the Leap Motion SDK had the wrong target framework selected by default and thus our scripts would not compile, which took time to diagnose and then resolve.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Coming from very little experience with Leap Motion and Unity, we have all made excellent strides towards familiarity of the development process. Despite encountering several confusing roadblocks, we have managed to build a functional program from what we have learned over the past 32 hours.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Because we had no experience with Leap Motion and very little experience with Unity, we learned a lot about how to program in a 3D space. We had to figure out how to manipulate the objects to work in 3 dimensions and learn how to use unity at the same time. We all learned just how powerful the Leap Motion can be in the right hands as well. After playing a few games to get used to the controls, we figured out that the real limitations to what can be done is only how much work you are willing to put into the project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hand-Ball Simulator</h2>\n<p>We hope to continue development on the Leap Motion using the base engine that we created for Hand-Ball Simulator to create all sorts of different applications. A few of the ideas that we came up with that we hope to pursue in the future are: a Jedi force simulator, a physics box in which the user can build different blocks and stack them around the world to create buildings.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4_2RZDvMiQhZXlzQ3NWdi1fbUE/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4_2RZDvMiQhZXlzQ3NWdi1fbUE/view?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Data Science Track - Challenge #1: Pred.

Do you want to ensure that your parking space stays your parking space? Are you landlord wanting to provide your residents a guarantee that they will never have to worry about parking in your apartment complex? If so, DONTSTEALMYSPOT.com is perfect for you!</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This hack was inspired by our team's constant parking struggles. Our college town apartment complex has very limited parking spaces, as such, it can be very frustrating to pull into the apartment complex only to find that YOUR spot has been stolen by someone else. Current solutions to this problem are not adequate. Mandatory parking permits are annoying to deal with and can limit residents to one car. Furthermore, parking permits can be difficult to pass between friends and family. Thus, the idea to create a parking spot sign that could identify whether or not a person was able to park in the spot, was born.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Takes a picture of a person, analyses the picture. If it matches to the owner of the spot, it welcomes the owner home. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used IBM Bluemix and IBM Internet of Things platform to hook up a Raspberry Pi 3 to the internet. The raspberry pi has a camera that snaps a picture of the face. It is integrated with watson text-to-speech and watson visual recognition software. The camera would be signaled to take a picture by a recipe that uses a raspberry pi with sensors to determine whether or not the parking spot is full. The visual recognition would then analyze the picture against an array of registered users to determine whether or not person is allowed to park in the spot.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning how to use IBM Bluemix and how to integrate the raspberry pi with the internet of things. We didn't have any prior experience using either devices, as such, it took us a while to get started. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Figured out how to use watson, and IBM IOT, visual recognition and text to speech. Our product idea is viable and can be expanded to multiple markets. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Learned how to use IBM Bluemix, IBM Internet of Things Platform, Watson Text-to-Speech, Watson image recognition, Node-red, and use the raspberry pi. We also learned how to set up a domain and have it linked to amazon web services. </p>\n<h2>Using Facial Recognition Software and Cyber-Privacy Vulnerabilities For Good (aka Watch-Dogs Category)</h2>\n<p>In today's day and age with social media, your face is public domain. Thus, our product takes advantage of this fact to provide a benefit to users. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Don't Steal My Spot</h2>\n<p>Expand the facial recognition, after it recognizes you be able to give you important information about the day. Send text message to registered user is unregistered user is in the parking spot.

The last main function of the website is served as a catalyst to allow teachers to communicate with a language a student uses as it displays on an iPad (or reads it aloud to the student through the iPad or tablet).  We found this to be a useful feature because our city is a refuge city and we have many people who can't speak English.
