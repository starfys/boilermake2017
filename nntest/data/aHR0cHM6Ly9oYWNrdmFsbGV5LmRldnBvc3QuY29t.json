The tools provided by browsers like google chrome were hidden making hard to learn of its existence. As an avid gamer, we thought that it would be a great idea to create a game involving the inspect element tool provided by browsers so that more people could learn of this nifty feature, and start their own hacks.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The project is a series of small puzzle games that are reliant on the user to modify the webpage DOM to be able to complete. When the user reaches the objective, they are automatically redirected to the next puzzle to solve. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a game engine called craftyjs to run the game as DOM elements. These elements could be deleted and an event would be triggered so that we could handle any DOM changes.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Catching DOM changes from inspect element is incredibly difficult. Working with craftyjs which is in version 0.7.1 and not released therefore some built-ins e.g. collision detection, is not fully supported. Handling various events such as adding and deleting elements instead of recursively creating a ton of things recursively.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>EVERYTHING</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Javascript was not designed to run as a game engine with DOM elements, and modifying anything has been a struggle. We learned that canvases are black boxes and are impossible to interact with through DOM manipulation.</p>\n<h2>What's next for We haven't thought that far yet</h2>\n<p>You give us too much credit. </p>\n<p>But we have thought that far. We would love to do more with the inspect element tool, and in the future, if we could get support from one of the major browsers, we would love to add more puzzles based on tools provided by the inspect element option. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">craftyjs</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cartercook/noCanvasGame\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cartercook/noCanvasGame\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["AndroidCamColourBlind", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>5 to 10% of males and 1% of females have some sort of colour blindness.

There are usually long wait times, which is further increased  by people searching for their wallets (not to forget the added processing fees). We wanted to create something that was easy to use and that would remove the annoyances and obtrusiveness of payment, and to do this, we decided to approach the problem using bleeding-edge yet proven technology, such as blockchain (not part of demo, but lightly implemented) and proximity payment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Bloqpay will eventually run on blockchain (to secure payment and avert processing fees). It tracks a consumer's location to add and confirm payment. For our current use case, this will add and confirm movie theatre purchases. Very useful for events with different areas and many other similar scenarios - the potential for this technology is unbound!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Android Studio, Microsoft Azure, a Raspberry and Sketch, along with technologies like NodeJS, Socket.IO, and others listed above.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the Raspberry Pi's failed, and we lacked a keyboard and mouse to debug. Later, we lacked a sd-card adapter to reinstall the OS, so we travelled to the mall and lost a lot of time gathering equipment. However, we were still able to pull together a very strong prototype.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting the tech to work, and overcoming some very tough obstacles. We also overcame a major bug we were facing right on time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that this technology and payment system will eventually become part of our daily lives (decentralization is the future of payment and autonomous software). We learned how to use the raspberry pi and different low-level bluetooth software to gather proximity data.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Bloqpay</h2>\n<p>We want to tackle other use cases and implement Blockchain.

Nike spent over $3.03 billion on advertising alone in 2014, which amounted to approximately $100 per second, yet they only received a marginal increase in profits that year. This is where Scout comes in.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Scout uses a webcam to capture facial feature data about the user. It sends this data through a facial recognition engine in Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services to determine demographics information, such as gender and age. It also captures facial expressions throughout an Internet browsing session, say a video commercial, and applies sentiment analysis machine learning algorithms to instantaneously determine the user's emotional state at any given point during the video. This is also done through Microsoft Azure's Cognitive Services. Content publishers can then aggregate this data and analyze it later to determine which creatives were positive and which creatives generated a negative sentiment.</p>\n<p>Scout follows an opt-in philosophy, so users must actively turn on the webcam to be a subject in Scout. We highly encourage content publishers to incentivize users to participate in Scout (something like $100/second) so that both parties can benefit from this platform.</p>\n<p>We also take privacy very seriously! That is why photos taken through the webcam by Scout are not persisted anywhere and we do not collect any personal user information.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The platform is built on top of a Flask server hosted on an Ubuntu 16.04 instance in Azure's Virtual Machines service. We use nginx, uWSGI, and supervisord to run and maintain our web application. The front-end is built with Google's Materialize UI and we use Plotly for complex analytics visualization. </p>\n<p>The facial recognition and sentiment analysis intelligence modules are from Azure's Cognitive Services suite, and we use Azure's SQL Server to persist aggregated data. We also have an Azure Chatbot Service for data analysts to quickly see insights.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p><strong>CORS CORS CORS!.</strong> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing was a huge pain in the head for us. We divided the project into three main components: the Flask backend, the UI/UX visualization, and the webcam photo collection+analysis. We each developed our modules independently of each other, but when we tried to integrate them together, we ran into a huge number of CORS issues with the REST API endpoints that were on our Flask server. We were able to resolve this with a couple of extra libraries but definitely a challenge figuring out where these errors were coming from.</p>\n<p>SSL was another issue we ran into. In 2015, Google released a new WebRTC Policy that prevented webcam's from being accessed on insecure (HTTP) sites in Chrome, with the exception of localhost. This forced us to use OpenSSL to generate self-signed certificates and reconfigure our nginx routes to serve our site over HTTPS. As one can imagine, this caused havoc for our testing suites and our original endpoints. It forced us to resift through most of the code we had already written to accommodate this change in protocol. We don't like implementing HTTPS, and neither does Flask apparently. On top of our code, we had to reconfigure the firewalls on our servers which only added more time wasted in this short hackathon.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to multi-process our consumer application to handle the massive amount of data we were sending back to the server (2 photos taken by the webcam each second, each photo is relatively high quality and high memory). </p>\n<p>We were also able to get our chat bot to communicate with our REST endpoints on our Flask server, so any metric in our web portal is also accessible in Messenger, Skype, Kik, or whatever messaging platform you prefer. This allows marketing analysts who are frequently on the road to easily review the emotional data on Scout's platform.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>When you stack cups, start with a 3x3 base and stack them in inverted directions.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Scout</h2>\n<p>You tell us!

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Being a team of four first year computer science students who are all participating in a Hackathon for their first times, we had no idea what to expect going in. Our only goals in mind were to make friends, learn things, and get some stickers. </p>\n<h2>The Journey</h2>\n<p>For a solid few hours after the hacking started, we had no idea what we were going to make. We ended up singling out 3 ideas, a microwave time calculating app, an idea/teamwork posting app, and a Github for everything app. After calm and peaceful discussions, we decided upon the microwave app, because the idea of using computer vision was just too cool to pass up. </p>\n<p>With that, we went straight to work. After a few hours of blood, sweat, and yes, a few tears, we finally got a basic website up and running. At big problem we had was figuring out how to calculate the microwave time accurately, since we couldn't find any data on the microwave time of each food. Our solution for now was to group foods into different categories and just return the time based on what category it was in.</p>\n<p>After attending the lecture on the Microsoft bot service, we integrated the technology into our app to create a reheat bot. Instead of just being a web app, users could now send an image through messenger to the bot and get the time that they should microwave the food for. The bot was quite a challenge, since none of us had used Microsoft Azure before and none of us knew C# neither. Somehow, we managed to finish the bot in the end.</p>\n<p>Around 3 AM, when we were all half dead, we came up with the solution to implement basic machine learning into our app to get more accurate times. Instead of just getting the time data from a static server file, the data would now modify itself depending on user feedback. With this implementation, the microwave times of each food item would be crowd sourced instead of just defaulting on some preset value, thus making it more accurate.</p>\n<h2>The Conclusion</h2>\n<p>After 125 commits, we finally brought the project to an end. Find the Github repository <a href=\"https://github.com/jackzheng06/microwave-time\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. We used Clarifai for image recognition and Microsoft Azure to host our back end as well as our chat bot. </p>\n<p>Reheat is a web application that takes a picture of food and determines how long it should be microwaved for. The website is mobile friendly, and there is a messenger chat bot for those who don't want to use the website. The app uses basic machine learning with user feedback to adjust the microwave times of each food item.  Reheat is the future of microwaves, perfectly heated food is just one click away!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://easyreheat.com/web/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://easyreheat.com/web/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>easyreheat.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end design/development with mainly HTML/CSS/Javascript.

As a result, the public sphere is diminished and civil discourse becomes more difficult. There are little information supporting the opposing side, causing people's worldviews to become static. Rather than debating against opposing viewpoint, people are forming echo chambers of similar opinions and only confirming their own viewpoints.\nThis application aims to provide a room dedicated for civil discourse by giving people opportunity to discuss and debate with people sharing opposing viewpoints. Even if the user's stance upon a topic is not changed, a mutual understanding would lead to more respect for the opposing side, uniting the global community.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>ChirpUp is a chatroom dedicated to the public discourse of contentious topics. For each discussion question, users select their stances and present a brief statement of their opinions. Then, they will be presented with a list of users online with opposing stances, from which they can choose people to chat with based on their statements.

We would use computer recognition to read the student number and mark and publish the results.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The program will first prompt the user to login (To ensure proper access to the marks). You an then create a new test cover, or open a previously created one for marking. Creating a new cover will prompt you for many different values for the cover, while opening an old one will show you a list of tests you issued. After selecting a template, navigate to a folder with scanned test covers and the software will read though them and push the data to the cloud. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Java in order to create a PDF outline of the front cover which can be customised with different variables. Using jPDFWriter, the cover can be exported to a PDF. This is now ready to be issued to the students. After scanning the completed tests, we use various image tools to convert the image to grey scale and check for points in the scan tron boxes. Is a box is noted to be a different colour then the background, and some probability/statistics, we know the box has been filled. The student number and mark are calculated and pushed to a student object. From here stats are created and sent as an email to the professor. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Reading the image file was more difficult then we originally planned. Finding the probability that a box was coloured compared to another (If some marks were made in a different box) was also increasingly difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to say that we have created a complete application with our intended functionality. We have successfully created a miniature image recognition system from scratch. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Things are not going to go as smoothly as you may expect. We had issues with the DPI of the printer scanning and the exact orientation of the page.

We wanted to leave a footprint in the rapidly-growing industry of Virtual Reality. We set a goal to incorporate a fun gaming environment using the latest VR technology.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This game allows the player to fly around space on a unicorn and dodge asteroids. You can pick up different power-ups to further advance in the game and beat the high score. The unicorn is controlled by which direction the player is facing and can be changed by tilting your head towards a different direction.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Unity as the primary game engine, with coding being done in C SHARP. We installed the oculus virtual reality development kit and the android software development kit and integrated those with Unity to build our game. We created various 3D models and textures using free softwares and also gathered royalty-free resources from the web. Our team split the work into two categories, design/layout and back-end programming. We filled in for each other when needed, allowing us to work more efficiently. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many hardware limitations were encountered, prohibiting us from using the full capabilities of Virtual Reality technology. Platforms like the Oculus Rift required high graphics processing power and since our team did not have high enough specifications to meet the requirements, we unfortunately were not able to use it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our communication and teamwork allowed us to work very efficiently and we were able to make up for the time we spent trying to get the Oculus Rift to work. We were able to get lots of work done quickly and effectively.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We've learned that teamwork is key.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Space Unicorn Arcade Blaster</h2>\n<p>There are many more features we would like to add to Space Unicorn Arcade Blaster. One of the biggest innovations we would like to add is integrated enemy AI, allowing the player to face more difficult challenges.

Excited for the week-long trip, he barely got any sleep... except for when he was on the train heading to the airport to catch his flight back to Canada. He fell asleep, missed his flight and had to pay over $600 for a new flight. To make sure this never happens to him or anyone else ever again, we decided to create a mobile app called WakeMe.</p>\n<h2><strong>WHAT IT DOES</strong></h2>\n<p>A user sets a location (intersection, address, landmark, etc.) as their destination and can happily go on about their business, whether that means sleeping, reading, or listening to music. The app then sets up an alarm that will notify the user when they are within a 500m radius of their destination. Location data collected from the phone enables the app to know where exactly the user is at any given time (with user-authorization, of course) and activates the alarm when they are within the aforementioned radius. This is perfect for commuters and travelers who use public transit and are busy or in a foreign country. Bus timings can easily get delayed due to various factors such as accidents, inclement weather or simply due to rush hour traffic, but the distance to a location will never change.</p>\n<h2><strong>HOW WE BUILT IT</strong></h2>\n<p>We decided to implement our mobile app using Java in Android Studio. In the code, we utilized a few API's such as Google Maps' Distance Matrix API as well as Google's Geofencing API. These tools would enable us to work with location services, providing us with real-time updates of the user's location, therefore allowing us to notify the user as soon as they enter the geofence of their chosen destination. As for the UI, we brainstormed and created a few draft designs of how we thought the app should look. After many iterations and team decision-making, we agreed on our favourite design and implemented it.</p>\n<h2><strong>CHALLENGES</strong></h2>\n<p>One major challenge we faced was deciding on our project goals. We had many different, ambitious ideas being suggested but we also acknowledged our time constraints and realized that we should get started sooner rather than later. Some time after starting, we revisited some of our initial ideas and considered modifying our chosen idea. However, upon further research and discussion amongst all the team members, we decided to continue working on our originally selected idea. Another challenge we faced was extracting data from unfamiliar sources, but that was quickly resolved by using a workaround strategy that was much more familiar to the team.</p>\n<h2><strong>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</strong></h2>\n<p>Through all the ups and downs, all the pivoting of ideas, and all the first-timers on our team, we finished the event with a working prototype and a creative project under our belts while simultaneously learning a whole lot.</p>\n<h2><strong>WHAT WE LEARNED</strong></h2>\n<p>Everything has a workaround. We realized that Android App Development is not as difficult as it may sound to get started with, but also that it has a high-skill-ceiling with plenty to learn and master. We also learned that no matter how different your team members' skillsets may be, as long as you stick together and persevere, anything can be done.</p>\n<h2><strong>WHAT'S NEXT FOR WakeMe</strong></h2>\n<p>If we were to continue this endeavour beyond the scope of this hackathon, one major feature that we would like to implement is social media interaction. Among other ideas, one of our main considerations would be to allow the user's friends to be able to view the user's current location as it updates in real-time. This would ensure that both the user and their friends know when they have arrived at their chosen destination.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">geofence-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-distance-matrix\">google-distance-matrix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DaerianDilkumar/HTV2017\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/DaerianDilkumar/HTV2017\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the back-end of the Android App, such as accessing and manipulating the JSON file in which the location information was stored, among other back-end tasks.

Whatever it was, we\u2019ve all experienced that disappointment of getting off at the wrong bus stop because we were occupied with our own lives. We want to fix this problem for you through our app, TranSleep.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Welcome to TranSleep!</p>\n<p>An app that wakes you up in your sleep that transforms your stressful TranSit experience into a relaxing TranSleep experience!</p>\n<p>This app is programmed to wake you up on your transit journey. All you have to do let us know where you are going. The application will use your phone\u2019s location, and when your phone is within 1km of your destination, your phone will ring and vibrate to wake you up from your nap.\nYou can also use this app as a reminder app, even if you are not sleeping so that you can get off at your desired bus stop with our reminder.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>To build this app, we broke down our program into smaller pieces. While brainstorming the required steps between the team members, we recognized the importance of developing the program separately as front-end and back-end. This was necessary for several reasons. Due to the enormous size of the transit data, a back-end service was appropriate to address challenges in efficient data processing. That is why we built RESTful API powered by Flask, with open public transit data into database from multiple transit agencies. In the front-end, we utilized Android Studios to design and develop the app, and how the user interacts with the provided data from the back-end server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>For the back-end, MySQL was not cooperating, and we had to switch gears to other databases. In addition, the open data from transit agencies were extremely difficult to interpret. Lastly, the remote server's performance was very limited, so we needed to experiment with different compilers and interpreters of python to make our program run faster.\nFor the front-end, we faced technical challenges with GoogleMapsSDK. The SDK was difficult and cumbersome to work with as it provided numerous irrelevant functionalities. We also ran into graphical layout issues due to our lack of familiarity with the Android Studios environment. Additionally, the integration of back-end data required extensive logic, so our crew faced road blocks to accomplishing our app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Nonetheless, with patience and perseverance our team refused to give up. After watching various online tutorials, and extensive research on Android Studios, we recognized  the bugs in our code, and successfully figured out ways to communicate the back-end data with the front-end. In the matter of 36 hours, our team overcame all these challenges and built a working application designed to tackle everyday issues.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Over this weekend, our team was stretched, and challenged with our knowledge of code.

The user can then quickly hit 'Enter' to transfer the word directly to the text form or document in use.\nThis method of typing is an improvement from a standard keyboard for people with low motor control.\nThe user does not have to continuously and accurately press the correct keys all the time.\nInstead, the program ensures that the user has a much larger margin of error and makes it convenient to glide instead of type.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://typingonice.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://typingonice.org/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>typingonice.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["HackUofT", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>HackUofT</h1>\n<p><strong>What is Hack UofT ?</strong></p>\n<p>Its an app where lovers of technology can gather as much knowledge about Hackathons, Internships and Events. </p>\n<p>As UofT students, we constantly find ourselves asking our friends how they find all these \"hackathons\".

Our target goal became focusing on creating an opportunity for people to keep up with current events and educate themselves while also appealing to their fun, and competitive nature as a mobile app game.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Majority is an iOS based application backed by a database of current events that users can vote on what they think the outcome will be. Good examples of these events include elections, and sports games. Users can earn points for choosing the correct answer, and the sooner they answer, the more points they can earn. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team split up into different teams that built separate parts of the project, based on each of our individual strengths and skill sets. Even then, we all had a learning curve approaching this project as we all still had to learn new languages and frameworks in order to make our idea plausible.

The time constraint didn't help with this challenge, as there was definitely extra pressure felt to both learn and execute these new things we were learning.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The team is especially proud of the quality of the design of the whole project. The back end and database are built to be very secure, efficient, and robust. The iOS app is very aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Client side is more work than we thought, and it is very, VERY important for the whole team to agree on the diagrams of the project (preferable before everyone starts building their part of the project).

Such anonymity is seen to create alter personalities. When people do not feel the consequences of their actions affecting them personally this tends to create \u201ctoxic\u201d/harassing environments, as is proof from YouTube\u2019s comment section.</p>\n<p>H-Rase is an application that runs as a service in conjunction with and complimenting online communication platforms such as YouTube and Twitter. H-Rase can filter out harassing comments or discussions, such that the user using H-Rase will not be able to see comments, posts or tweets that are deemed at a high-level risk of harassment by H-Rase. </p>\n<p>We hope that people of all ages and backgrounds will use H-Rase, but more specifically we have a focused interest on pushing the service to a younger demography; child demography all the way to early twenties.</p>\n<p>We created the app as a measure to curtail the negative affects of online harassment may have on the psychological health of people, more specifically children, teens and people in early twenties. One of the glaring characteristics of online conversations on platforms such as YouTube, which is one of the most popular websites in the world, is that conversations can quickly turn into arguments and ultimately lead to harassment. In one sense, arguably, it has become a part of online culture to use abusive language to communicate.   Evidently online harassment is an ever-increasing reality. H-Rase for the first time brings a real-time harassment filter which allows the user to browse the web without the threat of entertaining abusive language or facing harassment.</p>\n<p>How we hope to implement it: Lets take the example of Youtube and how H-Rase would work with YouTube. Once a webpage loads H-Rase extension for chrome or H-Rase application on android/IOS quickly reads all the YouTube comments posted on that video, using the deep the learning algorithms hosted on Microsoft Azure it can understand the make-up and construction of a post that can be deemed harassing. The application gives each post a certain level on the harassment scale, high level posts will be filtered out and not loaded on the browser. </p>\n<p>We aim to have a versatile app, we will have different levels of filtration. A user can choose from low level filtration to high level of filtration, such as adult filtration and child filtration.</p>\n<p>If a certain post is not filtered out and a user finds it offensive, they have the opportunity to take a screen capture of the post and submit it to the Microsoft Azure servers, where the post is first deconstructed to see if it qualifies as a post which could be potentially harassing. If it matches the criteria, it is then fed into the deep learning algorithm such that this post or a post of similar construction are filtered out next time. </p>\n<p>The incentive we give to users to report a post is through a point system and reputation system, like the one on Reddit. We have a leaderboard functionality in our app that shows the users with most reputation and greatest points. Users with most points and reputation will have their posts show at the top of the comments section. Some ways to earn points is by reporting harassing posts, it is by maintaining a good standard of one\u2019s personal posts.

Despite this, thousands of people settle for subpar practice when it comes to exams and technical interviews by practicing on a computer. Despite the unbelievable pace at which technology has advanced, paper still lacks key features such as IntelliSense, automatic syntax highlighting and the like. Of course, there are people who practice on a whiteboard, then type it out to run or make tweaks. It is not difficult to see their shortcomings in the efficiency department.\nThe great Michael Jordan was well-known for approaching every practice like it was a real game. With OCodR, you can do the same thing.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Write out code in one of several languages on our web-app, or take a picture of existing code from a whiteboard or sheet of paper. You will be able to run this code from within the app to see your strengths and shortcomings en route to acing your next CS exam or technical interview.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We have a great team with extensive experience in product design, full-stack development, image analysis and machine learning. Using our own algorithms combined with powerful (mostly open-source tools), we were able to build our project in around 16 hours.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Handwriting recognition, especially from an image, is a very difficult problem to solve (and something that no publicly available tools can do reliably). While digit-recognition technology is quite good, alphabetical characters are much harder to identify. When you factor in the frequency of special characters such as semicolons, braces and brackets in programming languages (which even the best libraries mostly ignore), it is a near-impossible task.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Ryan's image analysis tool provides greatly improved performance in recognizing text from images. This drastically improves the performance of third party tools (and eventually, our own neural network). Combined with Aaruran's budding neural network, we have high hopes for the future of open-source OCR.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>As a team, we learned a lot from each other. We came in specializing in specific areas, and feel that we will leave the hackathon with a more well-rounded set of skills.</p>\n<h2>What's next for OCodR</h2>\n<p>Our TensorFlow-based neural network aims to improve character recognition in programming languages, which could open the door for OCodR being an integral part of interview preparation and education.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/neeilan/ocodr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.github.com/neeilan/ocodr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["HTV2017", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Basic tools for courses that should have already existed about 10 years ago. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Stuff that courses should have had 10 years a go.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Android + Java for front end\nPHP + Laravel for backend and Admin Views</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Not enough hours in a day.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It is a bit more then a simple login system.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Building stuff that should have been done 10 years a go does not actually take that long time if effort gets placed into such system(s).</p>\n<h2>What's next for HTV2017</h2>\n<p>Who knows?

We always found ourselves having to manually research the food and drinks provided, as the only thing we see is text. We wanted a way to automate this process to make it more friendly and less bloated, and we believed we could provide clean user friendly solution that provides ultimately what you need to make your decision on what to eat.</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>What the F--- is That? takes a camera input source focused on text and on a simple tap, an image is captured. Optical Character Recognition is applied on the image and is then parsed into a readable format. What happens next is that it will analyze the text, image search of the product and provide nutritional information of the various food and beverages.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>It uses a camera on a device to take a picture of the text, and then we applied an Optical Character Recognition API on it and parse it into a string, and the Bing Image Search API to searches for results in parallel with an API that retrieves nutritional info on the scanned item, which is then displayed in a sleek user interface.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>Optical Character Recognition is insanely tough to implement, so finding an API that did it proficiently was a challenge. We tried multiple API's but ultimately we decided on the one that suited our needs.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We are proud not only of the motivation to create this product, but how quickly we were able to implement core functionality, within a single weekend.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We realized that we have the potential to make and expand our product into the wider market, and take our innovation to the next level.</p>\n<h2>The Future</h2>\n<p>Our goals towards the future is to use this in the wider market. We realized we made something that is extensible and dynamic enough so that we would be able to analyze things in pseudo-augmented reality wherein we would be able to live display information beside it in real-time. At the Hackathon we realized that we would be to extend our software to live Optical Character Recognition tracking within Augmented Reality environments such as Microsoft Hololens, which could be used for simple user functionality, but as a new innovative way to express ad space.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nafees-rawji/What-The-F----Is-That\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nafees-rawji/What-The-F----Is-That\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["WeofT", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To enhance the first year experience for UofT students.

I initially thought of building a hangman clone, when I found out that the idea was kind of lame in my opinion, following a meetup I had with some game development enthusiasts at the University of Waterloo. To help me expand my ideas, I took a look to see if there was anything interesting within the hackathon, and I came across the Microsoft HoloLens, where I wanted to use it as my input device. Unfortunately, I found out that my laptop did not had the specifications required to install all of the tools I need, and thus a basic kind of hangman was built instead.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is a one-player game where what you have to do is find the letters that make up the hidden word. If you select a letter than exists, you earn points. If you choose a letter that's not part of a word, though, you get a strike and a part of the hang figure appears. Be careful, though; every consecutive letter you choose that does not exist, you get a higher number of strikes in the following sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If you get a letter that does exist, though, you break out of the sequence. In addition, if you consecutively choose letters that exist, you get a combo in your score.</p>\n<p>I got 100 words programmed in from this website here: <a href=\"http://www.hexco.com/what-are-the-top-100-hardest-words-to-spell/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hexco.com/what-are-the-top-100-hardest-words-to-spell/</a> (Spoiler warning: this reveals all the possible words that can show up as a hidden word in the game.)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Unity 5 to put together the polygons needed and both Visual Studio 2015 and C#. The polygons were put together in a hierarchy structure Unity 5 provides me, and the scripts written in C# let me program the behavior of the game as well as how to transition between different states in the game.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I think the challenge for me was adding and placing together the polygons in the game to make up the hanging figure. I did ran into small problems in programming the behavior, but I don't think it was as intense as it was in building up the figure itself visually. </p>\n<p>Rather than conventionally hang the figure by a rope loop around its neck, I decided to loop the rope around the figure's waist. As the figure was rotated 60 degrees around the Z axis in Unity, I had to change the rotation of the polygons needed in making up the rope loop to make it look more natural. For simplicity, the loop is made up of 11 scaled capsules with their ends clipping one another. I could have imported a torus from Blender, but I would run into problems with scaling on import.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I think this project was very limiting, because I was only stuck with what I was comfortable with instead of challenging myself as I wanted to by using the Microsoft HoloLens. I would have been able to program the game where I can just move around the holographic figure and pick the letters as I go to get the full 3D view of what's happening with that figure. See, when I tried to start this out, I did spent some time to get the software I need to program the game and run it on a HoloLens emulator, but I eventually found out that my Acer Aspire E5-532 laptop does not meet the required specifications.</p>\n<p>This isn't my first hackathon. This is actually my fourth one with MLH, and I am running into trouble with coming up with ideas that turn out into projects that are finished at the end of it. Reflecting on this, I hope that by the next hackathon, things will be much better.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I'm able to make a game where others have already built, but just make a bunch of tweaks to make it more unique in a certain sense. I feel like I can do a lot more tweaking and play around with the features not only for game programming and see which one best fits, but also when I have to tune and debug the game when, either I or we, have a prototype of the game.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MLH Holo HangFigure</h2>\n<p>Add random holographic colors and animations, and experiment with some more tweaks into the game, such as having the player try to find not one hidden word, but two or more in one level. In addition, add lives and a few bonuses. I should add some subtle music and sound effects as this game is a lot more casual and low-level than intense ones such as <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Super Mario</em>.

I wanted to build a platform optimized for school and commercial residence management.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It has two main functionalities: assigning students to vacant residences using a matching algorithm and providing news updates. Administrators (staff, maintenance, property managers) upload a database file containing the details of their residences as well as a database file containing student data and their order of preference in choosing their residences.

So we played around with Alexa for many hours straight and did not feel any better because Alexa was quite cold and unwelcoming at times. However, we wanted to change this and make Alexa the emotional support that people can rely on.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Provides the user with a shoulder (or cylinder) to cry on. Alexa will listen to all your life problems and provide you with helpful, motivational, and warm comments that will make you feel all nice and tingly inside. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Javascript for everything and used Amazon's Alexa's API for natural language understanding and token parsing. In addition, we programmed our interpretation in Node.JS and hosted it on Microsoft Azure. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Simulating a therapeutic environment with the best of limited knowledge and experience.</li>\n<li>Designing a language interface that correctly understands user sentiments and provides accurate, appropriate feedback. </li>\n<li>Setting up AWS and learning the various API's such as AWS, Azure and Alexa.</li>\n<li>Learning how Amazon echo works and how to create new skills with it. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It may have significant social impact and help improve the lives of those suffering from negative emotions. It's also our team's first hardware hack!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Alexa can be really helpful and fun to interact with. We were fascinated by how cool the natural language processing was.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Alexa: My Personal Therapist</h2>\n<p>Perhaps sending therapy logs to clinics or real therapists.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ben-z/alexa-therapist\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ben-z/alexa-therapist\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the server that parses the speech tokens that Alexa generates and sends responses back to Amazon to output through Echo.", "", "", "", ""]], ["DocChat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Na</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
