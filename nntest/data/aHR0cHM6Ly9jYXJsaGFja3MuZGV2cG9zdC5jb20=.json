Sean and Cameron have a color vision deficiency known as deuteranomaly. This condition makes it difficult for them to discern red and green from each other, due to malfunctioning cones in the eye. This leads to other problems with other colors as well, since all colors tend to mingle with each other at some point to make another color. There are many simulators and emulators online that can show someone with normal color vision what it is like to have a color vision deficiency, but there didn't seem to be any that would offer the reverse. We set out to do just that.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We discovered a web app named Spectrum, which was a Chrome extension that would filter the colors of a web page and process them to show someone what it would look like with a color deficiency. We liked the concept, but decided that we would reevaluate it a bit, since we had to reverse-engineer the idea anyway. Each color in the sRGB color space can be presented as a vector, and using transform matrices, we were able to transform colors in order to present them in ways that would be more visible and appealing to someone with a color vision problem. We also were able to explore concepts put forth by the team at EnChroma, who develop glasses that supposedly filter light in order to assist those with color vision deficiencies. Since Sean and Cameron had deuteranomaly, they were able to provide input and essentially be test subjects for the extension.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we faced again and again throughout this project was trying to determine the best color transformation that amended the color-blindness problem without altering the colors of a web page too severely. First, we just went extreme to make sure it would even be possible. We did this by rotating the hue with a filter. Doing this provided an entirely different set of colors on the screen and created contrasts that Sean and Cameron were able to see. We commonly performed these filter tests on Ishihara Tests, the standard test for color-blindness. By doing this, we were able to verify whether Sean and Cameron were seeing the correct thing, therefore showing the filter working correctly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The greatest achievement for this project was the algorithm used with the color matrices, which was meticulously calculated and tested again and again until the most optimal filter we could create was formed. The filter allows Sean and Cameron to clearly see the numbers in Ishihara Tests as well as see green and red vividly. The filter works on essentially everything that sits within the browser window. It works with pictures, animated gifs, videos, Netflix, flash games, and others.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about coding and color through this project. The biggest thing is how amazingly subjective of an experience color is. We were consistently surprised with what everyone was seeing, since Sean and Cameron would see things differently than the rest of the team. On top of that, we learned about how surprisingly simple it is to apply a filter to a web page, but how hard it is to perfect it. The filter has great potential to help a lot of people. It may not be perfect, but it has such a massive benefit to those who suffer from color vision deficiencies. This could allow people to view and use web pages more functionally than before. Color-blindness is a topic that is often heard of, but rarely understood. Addressing this issue will help a very large amount of people, as it affects approximately 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women in the world. With around 7 billion people in the world, that's a huge population that could potentially be helped by applications such as this one.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fresh Eyes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Enabling support for other types of color vision deficiency or color blindness (e.g., tritanopia/tritanomaly).</li>\n<li>Porting our extension to other web browsers.</li>\n<li>Extending our color filter algorithm to other platforms (e.g., smartphones, Instagram filters, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">svg</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://fresheyesfilter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fresheyesfilter.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>fresheyesfilter.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fresh-eyes/fresh-eyes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fresh-eyes/fresh-eyes\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fresheyes/bgeggmjapkmjgniljnkgnbncpifgbnlk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fresheyes/bgeggmjapkmjgniljnkgnbncpifgbnlk\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>chrome.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Helped devise an algorithm to determine the filter matrix using a system of linear equations modeling the relationship between red, green, and blue sRGB values.

Unfortunately, number theory is often intimidating to those who have not picked up a math textbook in several years. The numerical patterns often become difficult to explain or understand. Visualizing these patterns, however, makes the beauty of these patterns understandable to people who are not as familiar with math. This tool gives everyone an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of numbers. We learned about this specific method of visualizing fractions from Rafe Jones, a Carleton professor, who wrote a paper outlining how this graphic is calculated. Also special thanks to Tessa Whalen-Wagner for providing inspiration with a mathematica program that also looks at fraction visualization.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Our webapp uses CSS, HTML, Javascript, and d3.js, a library in Javascript designed for generating data-driven documents. A user navigates to our page, and inputs a numerator, denominator, modulus, as well as a color specification. As soon as the user has entered valid input, the new fraction is calculated in the given modulus. This in turn, generates a the graph in d3.js and is displayed in an SVG element. The graph is drawn and displayed along with other relevant information about the given fraction.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Using a new language (Javascript) and library (d3.js) had a steep learning curve. Understanding and implementing the mathematics not just in a formal way, but a practical, visually appealing way was tricky.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The website is aesthetically appealing, accepts a variety of input, and responds and visualizes the new information quickly and effectively. Our goal was to make a page that would appeal to anyone, and we think the website's aesthetic appeal makes the graphics interesting to a variety of people. Plus, it's really fun to play with. We based our project off of a PhD project by a now Carleton professor, Rafe Jones, who wrote a nationally published paper about the properties of rational fractions we explore in this paper. While this may not have broad appeal, to theoretical mathematicians and to budding mathematicians, we hope this can be a wonderful confirmation of the beauty of numbers, and help us draw our minds away from the usual base-10 mentality.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Learned a lot about these programming languages, as a lot of the language or types of computation were new to us. Ben had never worked in Javascript before, and taught himself most of the web development skills you see displayed here. Marielle got to finally work on some of the visual concepts from Number Theory and implement them in this project (proving happy numbers, doing testing for different types of symmetry, etc).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rational Fraction Visualizer</h2>\n<p>We would hope to include additional interesting information about these numbers, and try to see if there are alternate ways to display the fraction, by potentially moving away from straight lines. Ideally this tool would be in part of a series of different math visualization suites. These tools could be used by teachers trying to get more students interested in math (and computer science).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rafe-jones</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">number-theory</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://thacker.mathcs.carleton.edu/cs257/wedinb/fraction_viz/visualizer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://thacker.mathcs.carleton.edu/cs257/wedinb/fraction_viz/visualizer.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>thacker.mathcs.carleton.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Adventures in C", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>For our project, we explored bugs in the Windows implementation of Wine.

As your heart rate skyrockets and your breathing becomes jagged, your thoughts become broken and disjointed. In the back of your mind, you know that you should try to take deep breaths and possibly take a medication, but it seems physically impossible to do so without any aid.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>From the comfort of your wrist, chillTwo boasts a simple, yet effective, breathing exercise guaranteed to calm your heart rate, an easily-customized health center to monitor your medications, and makes it easy for you to log your attacks for future reference.  chillTwo will revolutionize your recovery from, and experience with, anxiety.</p>\n<h2>Marketability</h2>\n<p>According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting more than forty million adults in the U.S. alone. While anxiety disorders are highly treatable, only about one-third of those suffering receive treatment. People with an anxiety disorder are five times more likely to go to the doctor and six times more likely to be hospitalized for psychiatric disorders than those who do not suffer from anxiety disorders. Our application would be widely marketable to those forty million adults, as well as to minors not included in such statistics.</p>\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n<p>Having had too-much experience with panic attacks myself, I know how frustrating and useless currently available anxiety-relief options can seem.  Thus, I went to TeenHacks several weeks ago with the aim of creating the most user-friendly, valuable product possible.  This weekend, I attempted to extend that platform to Pebble users by creating an application characterized by its clarity, elegance, and security.  With no prior knowledge of Objective C or Javascript, developing an application including frustrating animations, perplexing graphics, and strangely complex buttons within 36 hours was quite difficult.  While I am quite proud of what I have achieved here at CarlHacks, in the future I hope to improve upon chillTwo with further breathing exercises, more detailed support in the health center, and a location-based help service.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Brainstorm, Production, Presentation"]], ["Guardians of the Galaxy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>From a young age, each of us has stared into the night sky and wondered if we would ever be able to break the bonds of gravity, and one days live among the stars. Unfortunately, the world simply cannot grant us this request. We decided we did not want to wait for tomorrow's technology to bring us to the stars, and instead use today's technology to bring the stars to us. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>This project uses the Oculus Rift VR and the Leap Motion Controller to build an immersive world that allows users to travel across our Solar System. The user is first placed in what seems like a jail cell, and makes his or her first step by breaking themselves out, and gazing out into the vastness of space. We used a particle creator to give the user an authentic feel to the night sky by dispersing stars, and we used spherical objects that have textured to look like the planets in our solar system. The user can then move across the galaxy by simply walking like they normally would, and should they want to move quicker (since space is pretty big), the user can engage a warp but dragging their hands in opposite directions across the screen, or giving keyboard input.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This project has been difficult since its inception, and has given many of us the biggest challenge we have ever faced. Immediately, the Oculus VR is a complicated piece of equipment, and requires a very specific set up so as to function, much less function properly. Once the Oculus VR had finally begun working, the rest of the software needed to be implemented, and run in the Unity engine. We also had to decide how we were going to incorporate the use of hands. We had the choice of using either the Myo armband, or the Leap Motion detector. While the Myo would offer something more accurate, the Leap Motion would be easier to configure, and a faster way to test the system. We ultimately chose to use Leap Motion, which meant that our warp command would be more difficult to implement. At the end of our project, this choice we made ended up being a problem, as the Leap Motion could not accurately detect the hands of users so as to allow them to warp. This means we had to implement a brand new way of using the warp function, which had to be a keyboard input. This is unfortunately not what we had hoped to build, as were hoping that this would be independent of the keyboard, and free of constrictions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were extremely proud that we were able to use the Oculus Rift. We had never used the technology, and had no idea how we were going to build this immersive world. Even if the simulation doesn't run today, or tomorrow, the build was impressive, and we were able to build a lot of simulations that contained the beauty of space that we all wanted to see.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it can extremely difficult to build an immersive world, and have it run on any computer. We realized that even if every program could technically run, the hardware could slow us down at the very end. None of us had enough memory to give our simulation the proper start it needed, and we had to quickly use the Alienware machine at the end. We also learned that the amount of work that we agreed to would be much larger than anticipated, and that we would have to make sacrifices in terms of our sleep schedule and our well being so as to finish our project.

The game is in a fantasy setting, so where Advanced Wars features tanks and battle copters, we included swordsmen and dragons.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Two players are initialized on a map with three buildings; a city, a barracks, and an aviary.  There's also an unclaimed port in the center.  The game features land, sea, and air units which are each built in a separate location.  The units can be bought with gold, which accumulates as income depending on how many building you control.  Every unit can move, attack, and try to capture a building during its turn.  Capturing buildings take time to capture though, and take more turns for weakened units.  There are ten different troops, each with separate strengths.  The units can move and take cover on their turns, and both are affected by the terrain they're passing through.  For instance, mountains are slow to traverse but offer more cover than travelling by road.  Most land units can also be loaded into zeppelins so that they can be transported and dropped in otherwise inaccessible areas.  The game is over when your opponent loses all their troops.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our initial idea was to create the game as an android app, but learning to navigate android studios and dig through the documentation was more time consuming than we anticipated.

Our dream version of this game would feature a single player campaign with a tech tree as well.

We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">icon-finder</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stack-overflow\">stack-overflow</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Front-end iOS developer", "", "", ""]], ["Tab Nab", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Tab Nab</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hinzeh/carlHacks2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hinzeh/carlHacks2\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["S-Hunt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>S-Hunt</h1>\n<p>The project intends to allow users to store a message to the cloud based on their current coordinates, while others can read the messages only if they are exactly at the same spot.
