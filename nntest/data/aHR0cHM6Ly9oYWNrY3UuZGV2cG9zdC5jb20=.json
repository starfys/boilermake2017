Tea: it might not cure cancer, but it'll get you on the bus.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>TEA is delightful Android app that guides the user through figuring out which Denver metro area bus or train they should get on, when it is coming, and updates that estimate in real-time based on data pulled from other people who have recently taken the same bus.</p>\n<p>It's incredibly simple to use: you'll choose a bus route and a direction (pulled from up to date RTD listings), a preferred departure time, and a stop on that route where you'd like to be picked up. Then you land on a timer (which displays the estimated time until the bus gets to you), which increments and decrements based on the input of other users in transit who have recently taken the same route.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we push updates to the Pebble, a smart watch, so that when the bus is late or when the bus is almost there, your Pebble will display an alert and vibrate. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>RTD data is static, so we needed to implement functionality similar to Waze where user input is taken into account. We average RTD-supplied stop timings (which aren't necessarily accurate) with updates supplied by users who have just been on the same route when transportation arrival timings are calculated for a given user based on route, direction, and stop.</p>\n<p>Additionally, prior to this past Friday, the Pebble had not yet been integrated with Cordova, so we made it possible to integrate a Cordova-compiled Android app with wearable tech. Mike wrote the Cordova plugin to make pushing alerts to the Pebble possible. (We are going for the Pebble prize.)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments we are proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting all of this somehow working in roughly 36 hours without any unnecessary spontaneous combustion. Including a piece of technology none of us had ever seen in person before!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We now know a lot more about Postgres, Angular, the Pebble, and DDoSing Heroku nodes in real time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tea and Biscuits</h2>\n<p>Sleep.

The inspiration around the idea is that often times people gather in areas for large events like festivals and a platform like this could easily create an easy way for people to get more involved with other sharing similar experiences in that moment. It's not limited to special events however.  </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The site works using a PHP, CSS, and a mySQL database. Although there's tons of different features that could be incorporated in the site, out tema decided to make a minimum viable product sort of site where we could see if the idea was feasible technically. As of right now, the site is simply a geolocational messaging platform which \"unlocks\" threads and allows you to participate in them as long as you are within the threads latitude and longitudinal tolerance range (ie involved n the area the thread refers to) </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>PHP learning curves.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>getting over the PHP learning curves and making hte site work.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>PHP</p>\n<h2>What's next for poast.io</h2>\n<p>who knows!?</p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Awhere", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Awhere \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/674/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Awhere \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/636/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Awhere \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/638/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The next step to mankind is bringing data into the real world. Rather than rummaging through menus and search results to find what is right next to you, why not just pull out your phone's camera and see for yourself.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Awhere pulls in location information based on your own current location and which direction your facing to find buildings and business directly in front of you and display it on your camera screen.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Originally we were designing for android; however, due to the utter lack of experience from both of us we changed gears over halfway through to something we were vaguely familiar with - iOS. The main issue when working with iOS is that neither of us have had experience with UI, so attempting to create a dynamic UI was challenging. Also we did not have an apple developer license so we could not test our product on a real device which was necessary since we are coding for camera function, GPS location, and compass data usage.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Coming in, our knowledge was solely on command line applications, but we threw ourselves head first into JAVA and iOS learning and coding towards our goal. We came up with an amazing concept that fulfills real need in the world. We created a framework to build off of and can truly make Awhere amazing in the future. Lastly we had an amazing time and we are even more ecstatic about learning how to develop further and more effectively iOS techniques and applications.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We both have learned some basics to Android Studio and Xcode. Learned what is required to make a full fledged mobile app. We learned how to blend our ideas to meet a true need and work together efficiently. Finally we learned what kind of preparation projects need and how good communication along with a good game plan can help all the more.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Awhere</h2>\n<p>Everything!</p>\n<p>We developed a good foundation for app to receive information but our UI and underlying functions still need a lot of work.

Overall it was a very fun experience and we greatly treasure the weekend we spared to participate in this event. </p>\n<h2>What's next for VA/DG</h2>\n<p>The VA/DG has a mind of it's own, it will decide what comes next. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://vadg.herokuapp.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://vadg.herokuapp.com/about\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>vadg.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Artoo Robot Assisted Selfie-Stick + Twitter Updater:D ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5fJaD0nv8DU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Artoo Robot Assisted Selfie-Stick + Twitter Updater:D  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/242/644/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Artoo is the first robotically assisted selfie-stick that posts pictures straight to Twitter. Control the selfie-stick with a bluetooth PS4 remote to take wild selfies anytime!</h2>\n<h2>Using stepper motors, motor driver and an arduino micro-controller, this robot assisted selfie-stick can take pictures for you!</h2>\n<h2>We had issues with the gears that were supposed to rotate the robot. Our supplies were not ideal and we didn't realize a bluetooth shield made some arduino pins ineffective.</h2>\n<h2>We are proud that we were able to get the PS4 control to control Artoo. Doing so allowed us to  control the robot and post selfies straight to twitter!</h2>\n<h2>We learned how to interface multiple stepper motors to a single arduino in parallel with a bluetooth controller!</h2>\n<h2>We plan on making an Artoo 2.0 that will feature feedback control and will have the precision to pick up and move chess pieces so it can be connected to a computer that will play us in chess! Computers are no longer limited to the cyber world with Artoo around!</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">motors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">encoders</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ps4</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">usb2.0</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">shellscript</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
