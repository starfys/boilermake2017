Not just the little guy, but around 70 million people over the world are hearing impaired, and in just the United States, around a million people communicate using the American Sign Language. Surgical procedures happen to be really expensive, and day-to-day life gets a little complicated. Moreover, tech for social good is something we collectively believe in.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user puts on the Myo armband and makes gestures. The android app SignSpeaks scans the Myo, syncs it, and records these gestures internally. Using the Myo Raw Data Capture, we log the respective EMG, accelerometer, and gyroscope values in a .csv file which corresponds to a specific text character or string in the English &amp; French languages. For the purpose of demonstration, we've used the implementation for every programmer's signature  first words - \"Hello world.\" Using the Nuance and Google's text-to-speech APIs, this text gets converted to speech, thus serving as an effective interpreter, making communication between people breezy.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a native Android app, and integrated the Myo, Nuance, and Google text-to-speech APIs.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the Myo set up and running was the biggest problem of all. Initially, there was a lot of noise and interference while recording the gestures. Also, integrating multiple APIs into our app was a bit confusing initially, but we figured it out eventually thanks to the help of team collaboration and asking for mentor help when needed.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made use of the raw data available and after a lot of tinkering, figured out how to record the gestures effectively. We made it bilingual - English and Canadian French!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This was our very first time with hardware - especially the Myo armband, and we've learnt quite a bit about sensors and accelerometer graphs. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SignSpeaks</h2>\n<p>We're looking to fine-tune our hack, and also do another version with the LeapMotion. There's so many more functionalities that we can add to this, and that's what we'll be working on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nuance\">nuance</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-speech-api\">google-web-speech-api</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/neharavella/ASLGestureRecognition\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/neharavella/ASLGestureRecognition\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["UI , Backend Development .

Unfortunately there was a flaw with the way the Facebook implemented it. Having only one filter undermined other world events, and this only created viral support and did nother to solve the problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is where ProViralPictures.net comes into play. By having a wide selection of world events, charities, and campaign filters to choose from, no matter what is going on in the world you will be able to show your support. Also with integrated PayPal you are able to donate directly to these charities to make real in world progress.</p>\n<p>Users go to the website and log in with their Facebook account. They then are able to see what the different filters would look like over their current profile picture and if they like it with one click they can upload the picture to Facebook to show the world their support, and with one more click they can donate through PayPal to create real world change.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using boot strap templates for the outline of the website we were able to build out creating a method of creating images from the users retrieved Facebook profile picture. We then added the tech for uploading this image to Facebook in one click. On the back end side there is a large infrastructure created to withstand our future growth, enabling companies to create their own accounts and manage multiple filter campaigns while tracking who is downloading which filter.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Being a group of relatively new programmers, each step was a learning process. From attempting to work our way through Facebook's restrictive setup for uploading images, to saving two images overlaid as one to the server, we had to work as a team /<em>shout out to stack overflow</em>/ and were able to compete the task at hand.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>WE FINISHED!!!!!\nAlso we each learnt so much about different sections that we were struggling in. Being able to upload the photo to Facebook would be our proudest step as it took the majority of the time learning and reimplementing different methods.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Each of us will be taking home new skills and new knowledge in our respective programming languages. Also learnt that nothing compares to reading the forms when you reach a problem.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ProViralPictures.net</h2>\n<p>We plan to expand the system to allow companies and non-profits to log in and create their own campaigns individually to us. Also by taking 0.01% of donation, we will be able to advertise our site and help it grow to the level we hope it can. We hope to see ProViralPictures.net on your Facebook Feed soon!!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://proviralpictures.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://proviralpictures.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>proviralpictures.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the backend component of this project which allows for saving of both the filters and the newly created images.

We came in with no idea what we were going to develop...we hadn't even formed a team. After attending the workshop held by Clarifai about machine learning with their API. We just had to use this technology to make something amazing. After studying it and seeing potential for its facial recognition, we had the idea to make this app.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app, Twinder, analyzes an inputted picture by the user and searches among other users to find potential lookalikes. It returns the user's lookalike potentially allowing the user to find them and form a clone army!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This application utilizes the Clarifai API to analyze inputted images and tag the photo with words that describe the image. Using this, we cross analyzed these tags with other tags in our database and narrowed down to find the lookalike of the user. Our algorithm also calculates the percentage likeness of the users to give the user an idea of how accurate the hack is!</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We came across many issues while attempting to build this hack. We changed languages multiple times trying to find a way to implement both back end and front end development in such a way so that everybody could contribute to the project. We finally came down to using PHP and jQuery and the hack came out to be successful.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This project was as a whole an accomplishment we are all proud of. We came in with no ideas for a hack, with different skill sets that we thought would mismatch, and no plans to be a team. Rather than being a setback, all these things came together and everybody's different experiences helped us advance this hack to the next level.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This hackathon was a great learning experience for us, we learned to work as a team and a few new languages alone the way. PHP was a brand new language for half of us and it turned out to be something we plan to implement in future projects.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Twinder</h2>\n<p>The future of Twinder is vast. We are hoping that with each advancement of Clarifai's API, we can further improve the reliability and accuracy of Twinder's facial comparison. We also want to increase our database to allow users to compare to celebrities, among Facebook friends, and as many more inputs as we could possibly find. Other possible improvements we were hoping to make in the future is to allow the users to communicate and meet up once they find each other.\n<strong><em>The domain we purchased for the domain.com challenge was whyuhefftobemad.com, but domain.com did not process it on time</em></strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://whyuhefftobemad.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://whyuhefftobemad.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>whyuhefftobemad.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Real Estate Genius", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Real Estate Genius \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/468/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>App Front-page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Real Estate Genius \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/518/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Real Estate Genius \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/129/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Machine learning with two different data type</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Real Estate Genius \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/142/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Fusion of both text information and images</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Real Estate Genius \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/682/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The Clarifai API and a lot of thinking by two of our members.

With more data, we can refine our AI and offer even more precise result. Including other area than Montreal is also high on our list.</p>\n<p>There are so many open API that provide information on real estate property and their surrounding. Montreal offer data that could be useful to improve our AI. Other information than real estate price could also be crunched.

The purpose of the application is to act as a medium between people who are looking for someone to do a small one time job such as helping them move, lawn care, dog sitting, babysitting, tutoring, and many more jobs with people who are offering those services. Another goal of the application is to be community driven, meaning users will rate each other when one provides a job for the other. The person seeking someone for a job will create a post with details about what the job is, the expected price, date, and the duration and then other people who can fulfill that service at the specified time will bid against other people. The job provider will then be able to view each bidders profile and the rate they offered and then pick who they want to fulfill their service. </p>\n<h2>Technology</h2>\n<p>The application was developed using the Ionic hybrid mobile application framework for Cordova, so web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript with AngularJs were used to develop the application. Instead of developing a backend and setting up a database we decided to use Parse, which is a mBAAS. This allowed us to simply do the data access from the front-end and then letting Parse handle querying and storing the data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The scope of the project was really large and we knew this going in so not all essential features were fully developed. </p>\n<h2>The Future</h2>\n<p>We are considering working on this project after the Hackathon to continue developing it as a team. We believe that our application could have potential. Although, there is competition out there that provides a similar experience to our application, they have shortcomings and/or are not widely used by the public.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/harley1011/OneJob\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/harley1011/OneJob\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked with Parse to create the BaaS architecture and functionality.", "Everything CSS.", "I worked on the backend specifically: setting up the database, handling retrieve, update and insertion requests.

I use to search their name via google to find the names, it takes time, and google image of thing seems to not quite good.

Listed here are the products that the user has ran out of. Instead of just a simple checklist, we found a need to integrate a store map. Based off of the product and the store, our app will determine where in the store you items are located. This contributes to pain free shopping for the customer and less wasted hours for the workers.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We pulled the API from GitHub and opened it in Android Studio. We analyzed the code and started modifying parts. We added some different pages and tinkered with the layout. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were multiple instances where we were unable to edit certain aspects of the API due to the code being a higher level to our understanding and the way the contents were protected.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>For all of our first Hackathon, our goal was to create a useful application. Even if it ended up being basic, the goal was to make it work. At the end of the day, we created a functioning application that, if continued to be worked upon, could be used in retail today.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that thinking small is the key. We had so many different ideas that would make this app even better than it already is, but for our level of knowledge, some of those ideas fell short. This wasted some time, but it was valuable to learn from our mistakes.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mart Mapper</h2>\n<p>We will ask around and pitch our idea to different companies to see if there is any interest of this in the marketplace. If so, we will continue to develop and make our 24 hour project into a business.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">smart-pantry-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Jkoza/ConUHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Jkoza/ConUHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Plingo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Plingo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/744/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Welcome screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Plingo \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/743/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Phase selection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Plingo \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/742/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Language selection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Plingo \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/745/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Language selection_2</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Plingo \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/337/746/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Language selection_3</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>Inspiration</strong></h2>\n<p>Wanted to provide people a lingo reference app to access translations of basic phrases and questions of different languages.

Our web application allows the user to crop an image, and focus on specific parts of the meal. The app then runs the image through the Clarifai API, in order to acquire the proper tags. We then filter out tags unrelated to food, and use the best fit to perform a query on. The query is performed using the FatSecret API, which returns the user a simple summary of the nutrition facts, but also allows for a more detailed view. In the event that the information produced is incorrect, we offer the ability for the user to manually tag the item. This not only helps improve the user experience, but allows Clarifai (and eatr) to improve over time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We initially split our team into 2 pairs, where each pair worked on a separate API (Clarifai and FatSecret). After this, we cooperated to integrate all of it together with a visually appealing and straightforward front end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Being able to integrate between technologies such as Python, PHP, and JavaScript was difficult at first. Handling API calls was something that was new to all of us and took some getting used to. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>In the end we are extremely proud of how well we were able to work together as a team towards a common goal. :\").\nWe put in a lot of time for this competition, with most of the team not sleeping for the full 24 hour period. We are very proud of the finished product we managed to produce in this short amount of time. Managing to use the Clarifai API effectively was also very rewarding.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As we're all new to web development, we all learned a lot about various web technologies, especially PHP, JavaScript, and the use of API's, specifically the Clarifai API.</p>\n<h2>What's next for eatr</h2>\n<p>At the moment, the web application is not designed to handle a large number of simultaneous users. We would like to add the ability for a single user to track their daily intake, and set goals for themselves. We all feel very passionate and proud of this project, and we hope to work on it further together.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/fatsecret\">fatsecret</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jcrop</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jamesnixon.me/master\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.jamesnixon.me/master\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.jamesnixon.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/OFsDv\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://imgur.com/a/OFsDv\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>imgur.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jmznxn77/eatr.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jmznxn77/eatr.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped with the backend (authentication, parsing json, bash scripting) and worked on the website's HTML and CSS.

Our reason for choosing Android was because Java was the only mutual language amongst the group.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our challenges were numerous. Some team members had issues with either loading or installing the IDE. Half the team had not worked with Android, Android Studio, and GitHub. Some of the time was devoted to teaching and learning. In the end, we did not accomplish what we had set out to, but we will all leave having learnt something new.</p>\n<h2>What's next for eFood</h2>\n<p>eFood was a Hackathon project but an idea I personally like. We hope to continue working on this project and hopefully publish it on the Google PlayStore</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/miqdadamirali/eFood\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/miqdadamirali/eFood\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["## Accomplishments that I'm proud of\nI am proud of completing a project in my first Hackathon.

Since only one of us made some Android development in the past, we decided to try development for Google's OS.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app features multiple mini-games to train your brain with only voices command, leaving you hands-free. Every on screen \"button\" is in fact only text that, by reading, gets activated.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our app using Android Studio that supports Java development for Android. We also used Illustrator for all the graphical stuff. For the voice recognition, we implemented the Nuance API to get a great hands-free experience.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Nuance API was more challenging than we thought it would be. Implementing it for Android was hard mainly because Android is really difficult on how you manage external files and also because Nuance had problem with some of their files too. But by working with Nuance's staff and spending countless hours at exploring the API, we finally managed to make it work! Also, working with websockets was a new thing for almost the four of us. Internet-related development is not our main domain and implementing API with websocket was something quite new but we managed to deal with it and use it properly to build our app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Implementing the API and being able to control our whole application solely by voice. Many games incorporate voice recognition but only for certain features. Being able to control the whole thing with our voice only from the main menu to the game over screen in such a short time not only proves that we are able to implement such a complete feature while also proving that games should not be shy of voice recognition since it is now a very powerful technology and that the experience can also be great.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Three of us learned how to developp Android Applications in an efficient way in order to have a working and complete app in 24 hours. We also learned some things about websockets by implementing the connection between our app and Nuance's servers. We encountered quite many problems along the way but were capable of managing that challenge and complete our app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Vocal Brain</h2>\n<p>We'd like to implement some more games since with all the problems we encountered along the way, we had to put less games in our app. We'd also like to have some more functionnalities controlled by voice such as options menus. Implementing multilanguage support for the voice recognition would be something interesting for our project to open it to more people, especially children that are often unilangual.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nuance\">nuance</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HyruleMaster5/VocalBrain.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HyruleMaster5/VocalBrain.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend of the project.

in the morning and slipping multiple times was part of our inspiration to create this device. More importantly, over half of all seniors above the age of 80 fall annually. This can reduce their confidence and willingness to move and travel on their own.</p>\n<p>Coded in Arduino C, Catch Me makes use of the Intel Edison Microcontroller, and uses a script to automatically send a notification to certain contacts when a fall is detected. Once the user has fallen, the device monitors their vital signs to detect whether other complications have occurred, such as shock.</p>\n<p>To build this, we took apart the accelerometer that was included as part of the BITalino biosignal processing kit and connected the leads to wires coming out of our Intel Edison microcontroller. We also used LEDs connected to a breadboard as indicators of the functionality of our device.</p>\n<p>Originally, we wanted to use the BITalino kit to detect acceleration and heart rate, but the BITalino kept crashing for an unforeseen reason. We suspected that this was due to shorting occurring within the connections so we attempted to re-solder them but our soldering iron started to smoke and stopped functioning. We then tried to use an accelerometer that was intended for the Intel Edison but we were unable to receive the correct readings from it. Finally, we cut the connections from the BITalino accelerometer and connected it to the Intel Edison. Additionally, incorporating the script that automatically sends notifications upon a fall occurring proved to be quite challenging.</p>\n<p>We are glad that we were able to connect the accelerometer from the BITalino kit to the Intel Edison. Moreover, all the hardware in our hack works flawlessly for the most part.</p>\n<p>We learned that hardware hacks are not for the faint of heart. We also learned a lot about Arduinos, Intel Edisons, and biosignal processors.</p>\n<p>The next step would be to conduct studies to see if this product is in demand and is actually viable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fallen.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.fallen.tech</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">uno</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1JuL6fg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bit.ly/1JuL6fg\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bit.ly</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Implemented the backend environment on a crappy little minimal linux distro, which required building almost every requried package from source.

The app works by using Reddit API to search for posts directly linking to the YouTube video. It then aggregates and organizes the comments from those threads and presents them as a brief summary which is displayed directly on the YouTube domain.

To do this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to \"chrome://extensions\"</li>\n<li>Check \"Developer Mode\" checkbox</li>\n<li>Load unpacked extension and select \"hook\" as the directory for the extension</li>\n<li>Enjoy your new and improved YouTube experience!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Development</h2>\n<h4>Inspiration</h4>\n<p>As big consumers of both Reddit and YouTube media, we noticed a close link (literally) between the content of each website. It could be cumbersome to switch between the domains in order to view the content of users of each site. Thus, we were inspired to make a more streamlined user experience by building this chrome extension.</p>\n<h4>Goals</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Gain experience building chrome extensions and the technologies involved (JavaScript, css, manifest)</li>\n<li>Develop something we would be proud of and use ourselves</li>\n<li>Gain experience using RESTful APIs</li>\n<li>Have a good time!</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Challenges</h4>\n<p>Coming into ConUHacks, we had minimal experience with JS and developing Chrome Extensions. For the first time, we encountered the asynchronous nature of web browsers. This lead us to approach the initial concepts and code structure much differently then we had originally imagined in an Object-Oriented, Synchronous environment.</p>\n<p>One particular problem we encountered was getting our scripts to load between YouTube pages because of YouTube's html5 pushStack navigation. Our scripts required injecting html on page load, however our scripts would not run between pages since the pages were not reloaded during navigation. Our solution involved tracking items on the screen during a transition on using those as landmarks to relaunch our script.</p>\n<h4>Accomplishments</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Learning basic concepts and use of JavaScript, JQuery, Asynchronous Requests, and Reddit API</li>\n<li>Using outside of the box thinking to solve problems like pushStack navigation script re-triggering</li>\n<li>Learning the basic necessities and complications of building Chrome extensions</li>\n<li>Successful implementation and completion of our idea</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Future</h4>\n<p>The most exciting aspect about this extension is the ability to seamlessly intermingle related media streams. To extend the project we plan to continue to improve the Reddit-YouTube experience, as well as extending the integration to other related media streams (e.g. Reddit and Imgur).</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This was a result of long hours of tedious JavaScript, coffee script, css, sass and project folder management.

We connected a platform made up of two servomotors where the camera will be put. We connected a PS3 controller to the phone that links with the Arduino board to send signals to it. And we made another phone act as the eyes that the person wears on their head to control the platform with the camera. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the chalenges was getting the position of the eye-ware to send signals to the robot to control the spinning platform.

In order to patch this language barrier, we found a way to promote English grammar learning through a fun &amp; magical journey. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The purpose of our app is to teach English grammar by taking the user on a magical adventure. In our game, the user is the magician and must overcome the provided levels by using spells with proper grammar to kill a monster. When introduced to a monster, the user is prompted to attack by typing a spell. If not, the monster can counterattack and the user will be damaged in health. Each monster has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the user has to cast a spell that will target the monsters weakness. This game promotes reading/writing using proper English and quick problem solving skills.</p>\n<p>\"Spellar\" comes from the user casting STELLAR SPELLS.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our entire game design is centred around the program: Unity. We implemented the backend algorithm of the game and front-end (animations of frames) using C#. We also used Adobe Creative Suite CS6 &amp; Sketch to create the pixellated-style characters and icons.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of our greatest challenges was combining each team members' contributions together in a smooth manner. It was rough patch since we have a very interdisciplinary team, where one person was responsible for the graphics/UX/UI design, one for backend and one for animation and front end development. It became messy as we meshed our work together to create one extraordinary project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud of pushing ourselves to our limits. We all used a program, that we were unfamiliar with at the beginning of the hackathon, to create our game application.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We've learned many things during this hackathon. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Communication is key. </li>\n<li>Do not underestimate the time contraints! </li>\n<li>Sleep is for the weak (Just kidding...it is vital in your well-being &amp; allows you to be functional during a hackathon) </li>\n<li>Never be intimidated in learning a new program in 24 hours (we have proven that it is possible at this hackathon!)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for Spellar</h2>\n<p>Expanding our application with different levels of difficulty of English/themes/characters. We also plan to expand this product to different languages in the far future. We chose this platform because it is easily accessible to our targeted users (children &amp; adults). </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvbs86jgm30volt/final.unitypackage?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/uvbs86jgm30volt/final.unitypackage?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the graphics of this game.

Sites like TripAdviser doesn't look great at all so it must look fresh and modern.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Basically you enter a list of countries you would like to go. The app randomely pick 3 cities and for each cities, you will see possible activities. Those activities are separated in 3 main categories according to the traveler mood: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adventurous</li>\n<li>Foodish</li>\n<li>Cultural</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This is obviously a website but let's jump a bit into the core implementation. We are using Python language using the <a href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">flask</a> micro web framework as a backend. The front-end uses Bootstrap CSS framework. The database for the sake of simplicity is SQLite. For development purpose it is very handy. In this project we didn't care about those qualities apps have (like scalability, performance, or maintainability).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We all have different knowledge so we had to consider this criteria while choosing the scope of the project. It is our first hackaton and we were a team of 4. This is a big challenge to get everybody up and running fastly. The workshop were cools but time-consuming so we had to improve our communication workflow to be sure everybody is at the same point.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We did it. Even if we ran out of coffee at ~4am :). Our biggest accomplishment was our constant HYPE about the project. We were very motivated and we achieved to keep that attitude.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that when you do a Hackaton you have to focus on your idea. The code quality doesn't matter. The moment you are in a productive flow your only concern is to keep this mood as long as possible. If we had to reconsider something for our next hackaton would be to arrive more prepared. It takes time to find a cool idea that drives the entire time through the night.</p>\n<h2>What's next for backpacker</h2>\n<p>The project is simple and I don't think we would reuse our codebase. But the main problem remains: There is no app for young people. Maybe they don't have a budget as high as older persons but I think they are increasingly important over the years. The problem deserves to be addressed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://159.203.24.91/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://159.203.24.91/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>159.203.24.91</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://159.203.8.147\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://159.203.8.147\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>159.203.8.147</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Conuhacks-ETS/Backpacker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Conuhacks-ETS/Backpacker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I setup the project base.

I need to look at my schedule every day and I usually spent some time before each semester to generate my calendar. Today, I thought of a way that I wouldn't need to spend any time again preparing my calendar and I can share this application with every student in the University. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This chrome extension reads your schedule while you are on your Student's Center home page and it generates a downloadable schedule in iCal format that you can import it directly into any Calendar App e.g. on your Mac, Gmail etc </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using javascript</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was my first Chrome Extension app and it took me some time to learn how to do it. I also had to figure out how to make my file download and how to read through an iframe instead of reading directly from the Dom.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I managed to finish it on time and I hope that I can make other student's happy</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to build chrome extensions and publish them to Chrome Webstore</p>\n<h2>What's next for Concordia Schedule to iCal</h2>\n<p>Happy Students</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kpsimoulis/conuhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kpsimoulis/conuhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]]]
