Brianna would constantly ask her, \u201cYou have games?\u201d \u201cCan I see your phone?\u201d \u201cWhat games do you have?\u201d \u201cCan I show you something? Here, give me your phone.\u201d Each time Mackenzie saw her, Brianna would want to download the same kind of game: A makeover app. \nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 25% of professional computing occupations in the 2015 U.S. workforce held by women, yet 57% of the overall 2015 U.S. workforce is women. Our team, We4We, believes that starting interest in STEM at a young age might make those startling statistics better. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Before you play the game, you\u2019re given an eBook. This book follows Anita Jones (homage to Anita Borg), \u201cthe smartest girl in the world!\u201d and her desire to find her \u201cdream job.\u201d Her mom tells her to \u201ctry everything to see what she loves,\u201d so she tries being an astronaut, a businesswoman, a chef, and more. At the end of the book, it says that Anita Jones can do anything, \u201cand so can you!\u201d This is to give young girls with aspirations some validation that they can and will achieve anything they put their heart and mind to. \nAfter the girl closes the book, she\u2019s ready to conquer the world. We teach her basic coding principles by letting her tinker with function values, while and for loops, and much more. \nThe big picture is that coding can be fun, girly and beautiful too\u2013 the code she writes can be whatever she wants it to be. It\u2019s time to drop the gender-based stereotypes and pick up making the world a better place.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We originally started making our game using Unity, but as of Saturday night at 10:30pm we decided to start over and make it with JavaScript and HTML5. Overall it was the better call and we're all glad we made that switch. \nAnother challenge we ran into was creating the drawings. Elly is an incredibly talented artist and we wanted to showcase her abilities with Anita Makeover!, but we didn't have access to a drawing tablet. After most of Friday and some of Saturday morning, we decided it was best for Elly to draw everything freehand on paper, take a picture of it, then upload that picture to Photoshop for edits. It was a somewhat low-tech way of going about things but it was the most efficient and we think it turned out well. Photoshop was kind of confusing at first, since none of us have used it in quite some time, but we got it working with some help from Rob Pongsajapan. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Aforementioned, we are all very proud of Elly's illustrations. We are also proud of the fact that we brainstorm well together. It doesn't seem like something to be all <strong>that</strong> proud of, but getting four strangers to come together and think as one was very impressive to us. We all listened to each other's ideas and opinions and the game really reflects that. We're also proud of our team's motivation, despite the hardships we faced. We built each other up, and no one was more motivating than Adam; he kept us focused and excited about our hack until the very end. We are also proud of Mackenzie's ability to communicate her idea to the team and take criticisms and suggestions. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Most of us came to Hoya Hacks not knowing how to code in JavaScript, but Tim taught Mackenzie, Elly and Adam the basics. Quickly changing from C# with Unity to JavaScript was tough but we caught on quickly due to great teaching. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Anita Makeover!</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, we want to be able to make Anita Makeover! cross-platformed, which is why we initially chose Unity. We also want to add more models with different races, heights, and body types, each with a different story to tell. We hope to also make more stories and games for Anita Jones and continue to inspire young girls into pursuing STEM.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ec2-52-91-228-45.compute-1.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ec2-52-91-228-45.compute-1.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ec2-52-91-228-45.compute-1.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["HOYAHiker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HOYAHiker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/850/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login Page Background</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HOYAHiker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/851/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Map with levels - city, forest and mountain</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HOYAHiker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/852/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>App Icon</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Pokemon Go for adult fitness!\nWe have technologies to help track and sift through our health related data, but how do we motivate people to actually use these technologies on a consistent basis to improve their health?\nBy providing a story-esque goal along with gamification of exercise, we can build a unique and compelling experience that will hold users interests long enough to build up the habit of regular exercise. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app tracks your fitness activity with the Fitbit API.

It can be viewed live at noteroll.com.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A combination of a past in music and a present interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning brought us to want to explore genetic algorithms to generate music.  What's cooler than mixing together our two biggest passions?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Midi files are abstracted and flattened into a form in which a powerful, light-weight machine learning algorithm known as \"augmented n-gram modeling\" can analyze and compare multiple songs.  The ability to compare songs allows us to use this model as a test of fitness for a genetic algorithm, which evolves slowly towards being a \"legitimate\" song of similar style to the training data (from where we got the model).</p>\n<p>Just as important as creating the song, the presentation of data can allow new music students to learn more effectively.  There is no more accessible platform than a simple web browser on the internet, and so we have chosen a warm, friendly design to display online that can read and play midi files, including ones generated by the A.I.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This project was multi-faceted and has four main components:\nHardware: 20 odroids are networked together to allow for parallel processing to expedite the machine learning process.  This took time to make disk images for each mini-computer, as well as a lot of configuring just to physically connect all the wires.  On top of this, special scripts were written to distribute computational processes efficiently amongst all the odroids.</p>\n<p>Data cleansing: Open source, publicly available midi files were chosen due to their discrete nature.  Symbolic music is much easier to manipulate than wave forms, but there is still a lot of data to parse.  So, after much brainstorming, we came up with an algorithm to flatten and parse the midi files until they were in a very manageable state.</p>\n<p>Machine learning: A two-step process, the machine learning aspect first developed a test of fitness using an augmented n-gram, and then used this test of fitness for a genetic algorithm to compare against.  Tricky calculations allow for the genetic algorithm to mutate, evolve, and eventually converge to a song.</p>\n<p>Visualization and application: Once a song has been generated, it needs to be shared or learned.  A web interface was developed that can read midi files, show their musical representation, and actually play the music as well.  A piano was chosen as the instrument due to its efficacy for teaching music to people fo all ages.  The keys on the piano light up in anticipation of upcoming notes, and quickly flash exactly in time with the music, providing an intuitive user-experience. This interactive representation of music could potentially be more effective than traditional sheet music for those who are more visually inclined. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>With so many moving parts and interlaced layers, it was very challenging to get everything to \"wire together\" properly.  Disk images took time to set up.  Data collection and cleansing eats time as well.  And one of the downfalls of coding in multiple languages among multiple people was getting these different languages to interface cleanly and quickly with one another.</p>\n<p>Algorithm design was also a big hurdle, since before code can come to screen, a clear idea of the goal and path to it is needed.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Out of nowhere, a bunch of code was written that worked.  Data was clean.  Analyses were made.  The server rack that holds the odroids is well-designed and is both visually-appealing and highly functional.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to work as a team and get code to work amongst several people.  A lot of technical tricks regarding specific programming languages.  Cluster set up.  Machine learning algorithm design (n-gram, genetic algorithm).  What it really means to work nearly nonstop and under pressure. That this is definitely the right line of work for us.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ScoreSight</h2>\n<p>We plan to continue our work with this algorithm and approach to music analysis.  If music can be represented in more efficient and better ways, more people will be able to learn and study music.  In addition to this, as the quality of music generation increases, more and more interesting combinations of new songs can be written by A.I., and this can be shared by friends to others in a future social networking platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://noteroll.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://noteroll.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>noteroll.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/micahhauge/HackathonDreamTeam\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/micahhauge/HackathonDreamTeam\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the dynamic visual representation of the music.

Both researchers and consumers alike struggle with finding relevant data in news articles. We decided to give more flexibility in the visualization of this data, we would use VR.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our VR app allows you to explore trending news articles in virtual reality.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>There are two parts to our app: the app itself and a web service. The web service is hosted on AWS and gathers relevant information including news categories and trends. It then aggregates the information into an easy-to-use JSON output for the app. The app requests this information at periodic intervals. It translates the data into objects and displays news articles in order based on trending topics. \n`## Challenges I ran into\nUnities version of C# does not support parsing nested object in JSON data, so we had to use workarounds and external libraries to parse this data.</p>\n<p>In addition, we had planned to use an Oculus to demo as it would have a better resolution and framerate, but we're not able to boot the Oculus up on any computers we had access to.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our product has a solid base implementation and should be easily expandable. The web service can easily package more data, sort by complex parameters, and retrieve news by category. More data visualization can be implemented into the app simply by interpreting the new data and setting properties such as color and size relatively.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We previously had no experience in news APIs and only minimal experience using Unity for VR. Everyone on our team got a good chance to explore these new fields and their product landscapes.</p>\n<h2>What's next for VR News</h2>\n<p>More data visualization and personalization can be packaged into the app, differentiating it more from current news aggregators and exemplifying the advantages of VR. In addition, allowing the user to see trending news through time adds another level to the data visualization applications of the app. VR allows a huge potential for data visualization, since the location, physical properties, and the world itself can change with one change of a parameter. This immerse experience allows users to experience the data, rather than just read numbers.</p>\n<p>More media integration can also make our app more visually appealing and better use VR tech. Many news sources are starting to include 360 video and other VR techniques so by adding, regular media and this VR media, the user can have a better all around experience of the news rather than just reading the news.</p>\n<p>Overall this app is about the experience. We want to continue improving UX and making users feel more immersed in this massive feed of data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Blox.io", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Blox.io \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/436/845/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Background Image To Be</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I/O Games such as Agar.io and Slither.io</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows you to fight/defend against NPC monsters in real time with other users on separate computers</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Frontend: javascript Backend: socket.io and node.js</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating visuals (front end) with code (back end), detecting collisions, github merging, deploying to server</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Collisions between players and NPCs, integrated visuals, actually having a presentable and usable product</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to use Github, network sockets, server side vs client side coding differences.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Blox.io</h2>\n<p>To integrate a map/background image and consider collisions between players and NPCs.\nMore people, more fun!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://phumd.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://phumd.org/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>phumd.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on Background Image To Be, Monster NPC Visual, Sword and Shield Visual", "I worked on the client side graphics.", "", ""]], ["CardinalMed", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIZOJ8lby80?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Patients of heart diseases can find a doctor, make an appointment and communicate with them easily  after the appointment.

Only relatively recently in human history have we become technologically advanced and started living in bigger communities. But living closer together has not improved communities. We have paradoxically become more isolated as our living arrangements have become more compact. Everyone faces problems in their lives that could others nearby could easily help with but it is more often than not impractical and too awkward to ask for help. </p>\n<p>How many times have you desperately needed a stapler? Or ran out of milk? Or needed help getting luggage up flights of stairs? There needs to be a way for people to harness the power of their immediate community to help solve these small problems.</p>\n<p>People need to feel needed! Apparently, the elderly are 3x more likely to die if they don\u2019t feel needed.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>favorMe allows people to give and ask for small favors. Users can download the app and create an account from which point onwards they can access the favor marketplace. The radius of the favor marketplace in miles/km can be adjusted in the settings screen. They can make a request by typing it in a search function. After making a request a feed is updated and everyone with the app in the favor marketplace radius is notified of the new request. Other users can then choose to accept the request, if they do so they are then given a time limit to fulfil the favor. If the time limit runs out, the favor request is returned to the feed for another user to fulfil.</p>\n<p>(Rewards system: Users are given favorPoints when they first sign up. Afterwards, users must do favors for others in return for more favorPoints which they can redeem for favors themselves.)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built favorMe app using MIT App Inventor 2, a language that uses a graphical interface that lets users drag-and-drop visual objects to build an application for Android.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>While Patrick Blinkhorn had experience with App Inventor in the past, he needed to review the language for several hours before he was comfortable using it again. In addition, he helped address several challenges his teammates encountered with App Inventor.</p></li>\n<li><p>None of us have android phones, so we needed to use the Android Emulator to test our app. It takes approximately 2-3 minutes to load the Android Emulator, so we spent a significant amount of time waiting for to test our app on the Emulator.</p></li>\n<li><p>On Saturday night, we encountered a major scaling issue with the layout of the app on the Android Emulator. It took us several hours to a) deduce the source of the bug, and b) to restructure and reformat the parameters so that all of the components fit on the screen. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Worked in a group setting to brainstorm a potentially revolutionary app that could connect individuals to exchange favors and regain the human connection that we are losing--ironically--as we live in more compact spaces. </p></li>\n<li><p>Identified a platform, MIT\u2019s App Inventor, to produce the app considering the strengths and weakness of the group.</p></li>\n<li><p>Discussed the possible weaknesses in our proposed idea beforehand in order to produce an app with the best possible features.</p></li>\n<li><p>Learned to navigate through the platform\u2019s functions and comprehend its full capacity.</p></li>\n<li><p>App Aesthetics--logo design, sizes of icon, font, etc</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Learned to use a new platform to make an Android app.</p></li>\n<li><p>The necessity for attention to detail! </p></li>\n<li><p>Experiment until you get it right! 1) Identify the problem you want to solve, 2) Observe what variables you can control to change results, 3) Try changing a small sample, 4) Continue to experiment until you recognize patterns, 5) Solve problem </p></li>\n<li><p>Hacking as a group can be difficult unless you have a clear and organized action plan. </p></li>\n<li><p>That there are platforms made to make coding easy.

Unfortunately, Medium supports only a limited API, and since all the content is user-generated, there is no way to listen to the articles podcast-style while on the go. Thus, I decided to build a mobile app to take care of this.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app scrapes and parses Medium's website, and then runs a text-to-speech conversion, allowing users to listen to Medium articles on the go. This is also quite helpful for those with accessibility concerns. The app has a dedicated interface for displaying trending stories and also enables searching for articles of interest.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built this using React Native for the mobile app itself, and I implemented a scraping and parsing system written in python that is hosted using Amazon Web Services' Amazon Lambda. I also used Amazon Web Services' API Gateway to make my Lambda function accessible via an endpoint that my mobile app could access.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge for me was figuring out a way to host the processes that would scrape, parse, and return data about Medium's website to my mobile app. Fortunately, Amazon Lambda provided exactly the sort of functionality I needed, and after experimenting with it for a little while, it ended up being the perfect solution. In addition to this, I had to hack the text-to-speech software to allow for a good listening experience.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm very pleased that I and others will now be able to listen to Medium on the go! I get a large portion of my news from this website so I'm excited that I can now also consume that information audibly. Also, I'm incredibly happy that I now have a thorough understanding of AWS and Amazon Lambda in particular that I can draw on for projects in the future.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about serverless computing through AWS Lambda, how to work with text-to-speech conversion on a mobile app, and how to carefully scrape and sanitize user-generated data.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MediumPlay</h2>\n<p>Now that I have constructed this initial framework, I see no reason that I can't build this out to support lots of other interesting content-driven sites that people want to listen to instead of reading. After some scaling work and security improvements, I'm going to launch it to the app store!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/willdeuschle/MediumPlay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/willdeuschle/MediumPlay\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built end-to-end."]]]
