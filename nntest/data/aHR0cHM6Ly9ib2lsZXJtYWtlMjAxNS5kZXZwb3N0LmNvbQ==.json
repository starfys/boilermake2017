While brainstorming for ideas for the hackathon, we came across a lot of cool technologies and party events in which such interactive technologies were used. What we noticed is that an interactive device which would sync with the music being played and involve the user in controlling operation of several exciting tasks is missing. We also realized that Halloween is round the corner. Thus we decided to design and develop our Halloween party station which would interact with the user in an entertaining way. </p>\n<p>The Halloween Party Station is designed to be synchronized with an interactive audio-visual application so that the user would be able to use motion control to play while seemingly dancing to the dynamic music and visuals. In addition, we added various features to make the user feel like the application will \"react\" to his actions. These include: a balloon that will pop at the peak of the user's performance, a 3D-printed bobblehead that will groove to the beat of the music, and Christmas lights which will either run in random sequence or flash rapidly depending on the user motion. </p>\n<p>Most of the interactive events are controlled by the Arduino and the nrf24L01 wireless RF-transceiver. The nrf24L01 transceivers are used for transfer of data between the custom-designed motion controller and the base controller. \nThe custom-designed motion controller is a device which consists of an arduino nano, a 6-DOF accelerometer, 9-Volt battery and two-channel relay. The motion controller is unique and innovative since we modified the sleeping mask provided by Walmart into a headband which houses the electronics of the motion controller. The motion controller is responsible in sensing the head movements of the user as well as touch inputs to trigger various tasks in the base controller. </p>\n<p>The base controller is the main hub which smartly analyses the information obtained from the motion controller and the audio signal. The base consists of an arduino nano, 3 two-channel relays, 120-volt battery, power regulator and nrf24L01 chip. The base controller processes the information obtained based on signal processing and sensor fusion algorithms. The base controller is also responsible for the following outputs namely: audio-visual information control, balloon popping, christmas lights control and animatronics head control. All the outputs are driven using relays. In addition, the bobble-head was 3-D printed, our balloon was hanged on a pole made of PVC pipes, and the Christmas lights were controlled by various relays.</p>\n<p>During our project, initially we planned to make a dry rocket launcher but were not allowed because of safety issues. We immediately brainstormed and came up with a balloon popping idea to replace the rocket launcher which was really self-motivating for the team. On day 2, we had a lot of trouble in setting up the wireless communication between the nRF24L01 chips and seamlessly send the sensors data to the base controller. We spent several hours coding and testing the device to make sure the algorithm is properly implemented and everything is successfully executed. Overall, system integration was another big challenge. </p>\n<p>I am really proud that my team and I were able to successfully design, develop and integrate an entire system while sticking to a timeline and being able to achieve the planned functionalities. We also were able to learn each others' strengths and weaknesses as individuals. The biggest achievement of this experience is that we intuitively came up with a completely new and unique interactive motion controller. </p>\n<p>The next stop for the Halloween party station is to entertain Purdue students during Halloween by integrating more features and operations that can be controlled by the user.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">relays</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">balloon-dropper</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sound-system</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">frets-on-fire</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vixen</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nrf24l01</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-basic\">visual-basic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-scanning</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/servo\">servo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">capacitative-touch</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">embedded-systems</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-windows</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">custom-wireless-motion-controller</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">power-regulators</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Project Green Light", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YdCpkY6iJVo?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Green Light \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/114/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Green Light \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/115/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Green Light \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/116/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We struggle and often find it awkward to approach and meet new people in the real world. We want to bring the comfort of interacting with people behind a screen to the real world using as simple and unobtrusive a system as possible. In addition, we want to create a tool which can measure the rate of change in the willingness for people to socially interact with one another in any given environment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Project green light breaks the awkward uncertainty when approaching new people through a simple lighting system displaying the status of an empty seat in public places. The user simply sits down and sets the status of all the empty seats at the table. Whether you are looking for company, or looking to concentrate, project green light always works in your favor.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Beacon For Friends (BFF) was made using an Arduino which controls the manipulation of the product. Buttons were used to change the color on 4 RGB LEDs and the product was housed in a plastic container, which was designed to look modern and elegant. A web application interacting with the device was built using Python and Flask.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the main challenges was time constraints, because of which it was not possible to 3D print the case for the BFF. Another challenge was sending data from the device to the web server and maintaining a distributed system with high fault tolerance, which would have allowed endless possibilities for the BFF.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The greatest accomplishment of this project is its huge market potential of our project. With endless opportunities, this project can be used in almost every cafe, library or dining hall all over the world. We were also able to develop a website for the BFF: <a href=\"http://changethelight.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://changethelight.me</a>.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to harness the power of the Arduino to create and design projects. We also learned a great deal about hardware-software integration as well as the importance of data in our everyday lives. Project Green Light gave us the ability to take a seemingly unmeasurable dynamic like social interactions and track it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project Green Light</h2>\n<p>We would be able to collect our own API and analyze it to add new features to the product. If the product gets fully implemented, we would be able to have a fault-tolerant system to allow a single user to access a device at any given time. We could also allow users to access the product from the personal device of their choice.\n[<a href=\"http://changethelight.me\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://changethelight.me</a>]</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">arduino-c</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://changethelight.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://changethelight.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>changethelight.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I developed the CAD for the structure which included optimizing interior space and designing for aesthetic appeal.

The receiver then decodes these bits, using an asynchronous laser clock to determine when the received data is valid, and outputs the decoded data to the serial monitor. After a message is sent, control is transferred to the previously receiving controller and it becomes the new transmitter. Control can be passed back and forth like this indefinitely.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We split up the project into transmission and reception of light signals. In the end, we found our solution was much more robust than we thought it would be so we decided to mash the two together and make a fully functional instant messenger.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The photo resistors responded very strangely to the laser pulses initially and it took us a long time to dial in the laser pulse widths to consistently send accurate data. We also spent a lot of our time optimizing the way in which we read our data such that we could maximize our baud rate.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully got our two computers to communicate back and forth while exceeding a baud rate of 100! Our initial measurements showed that we would be limited to a transmission rate of 20 bits per second but we shattered that goal.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to implement UART communication protocols in the Arduino utilizing interrupts and handshaking to transfer transmission control during operation.</p>\n<h2>What's next for LaserCom</h2>\n<p>We'd like to find a way to more evenly share control of the messaging interface. Currently after you send a message you must wait to receive a message before you can send another. We would also like to use higher quality lasers to achieve a much greater communication range.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I programmed the receiver in Arduino and helped set up the hardware and develop the communication protocol.

From snapchat to vine to beme; they all revolve around sharing who you are with the people around you.  </p>\n<p>But they are all missing something.  Every _ popular _ user on vine and snapchat super-star are incredibly similar.  They become popular making short crowd mentality inducing videos that really carry no substance.  This is where prompt steps in.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Rather than a user standing in front of a camera and talking to their audience with pre-prepared speeches, prompt will _ prompt _ you with a question that you will have a few seconds to think about before which you will have to answer it.  This might seem a little bit intrusive at first, but it levels the playing field in the global community, and prevents users from putting up fake walls around themselves just for their audience on their social app.  </p>\n<p>With this comes added benefits.  You can use this application as a private video journal and make as many personal entries as you like.  This lets people \"scroll back\" on their life and reflect upon what they thought, how they matured, and enjoy nostalgia that the app is sure to bring.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The front end was built in swift.  The UI is not overly complicated and it is clean and easy to use.  We took advantage of the numerous tools that xcode 7 has to offer which made the application design relatively painless.  The back end however was the real meat of the project.  We decided to build the backend in a way that we could essentially scale to millions of users instantly.  We built the backend on top of kubernetes and amazon ec2 which allows us to dynamically stir up more servers when under high load.  This is theoretically infinitely expandable.  IN addition AWS and kubernetes, we took advantage of many cloud based tools which we deployed to our our cluster running on AWS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This project was built to scale larger than anything we had previously worked on.  We used best practices from industry giants like Netflix and Apple to build our system.  This was not easy to say the least.  After reconfiguring the cluster over 100 times in 24 hours due to various routing and dependency issues.  Finally we were able to call the cluster stable.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The sheer magnitude of the project and how quickly we completed it is beyond comprehension.  We took on this project as an exercise in building a real world scalable service.  And we completed that goal despite none of us ever using swift or ios development before.  And 2 of us never having attended a Hackathon before.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This whole experience taught us a lot.  For one, ios development is very interesting and we can definitely see ourselves building ios applications again.  But the real lesson was in the sheer magnitude of work and understanding it takes to build a scalable system like we have.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Prompt</h2>\n<p>We plan on implementing many more features from facebook integration, to prompt suggestions.  Our list of potential features is ever growing and we would love to take this application to a point where it is just as much a household name as snapchat or instagram is today.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">casandra</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods\">cocoapods</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">s3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kubernetes</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docker\">docker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">core-os</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-load-ballance</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-vpc</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mono</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">owen</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">openshift-origin</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">elastic-search</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">heapster</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kibana</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">grafana</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">influx-db</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-efs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-route-53\">amazon-route-53</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mozrila/prompt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mozrila/prompt\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.prompt.life\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.prompt.life\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.prompt.life</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Web Roast", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h3>In the beginning</h3>\n<p>When teaming with three equally experienced developers at a hackathon, you trust that the event atmosphere will provide both the motivation and creative space to brainstorm something <em>innovative</em> or at very least worthwhile.  This was simply not the case.</p>\n<p>It was 3:45 in the morning when we set an alarm to decide on an idea.  As if we had just eaten Taco Bell, we began comically excreting ideas within minutes of the deadline, each more entertaining than the next.  Remember all those god-awful pieces of code documentation that everyone definitely laughs at?  What if those webpages, no longer, could pretend to be coherent?  How about providing web-surfers with a <strong>platform-neutral utility</strong> to critique content regardless of context?  At long last, we had it.</p>\n<h3>The Idea</h3>\n<p>Web Roast is primarily a chrome extension that unearths a <em>hidden social network</em> that spans the entire web. On each page, it displays a score as a badge on the icon based on the votes of previous venturers. The user can also click the icon to see comments that others have left behind.

You can see a running list of each item each person has added to the cart, and you can keep track of how much each person is paying at the register.</p>\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n<p>Two Carts is super simple throughout the full stack. The client-side is a simple user interface with only a few buttons. We made use of Apple's native, first-party barcode scanning. Additionally, we used the networking capabilities in iOS to communicate with the backend. On the backend, we use PHP and a framework we also wrote to easily access the database.</p>\n<h2>Why We Did It</h2>\n<p>We are roommates, and we go shopping together for things we need in our dorm room. Because we share a lot of the items we purchase, we pay on one bill and divide up the purchases afterward by looking through the receipt. We knew there was an opportunity for us to fix this problem, so we just decided to design and code it!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I implemented the backend and wrote the networking code to tie the front-end to the backend.", "I worked on coming up with the general idea of the application.

Especially on a large college campus, answers are diverse and can span the entire globe. Hometown provides a fun and easy way to keep track of where your friends are from, and can provide some interesting facts such as how local or global your friend network is. Hometown is not just another social media app - it purposefully requires you to add friends manually, with the goal of being a fun and natural part of your social life and not one more place to import all of your Facebook friends.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hometown is based around a very simple contact list that only requires a name and hometown, although it can take extra fields such as a picture or phone number as well. It then plots all of the hometowns on a map to display this information graphically. A third view shows interesting 'metrics' about your friend list, including the furthest and closest hometown to you, average distance to hometowns, and number of friends from nearby your hometown.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We developed apps for android and iPhone in parallel, using Android Studio and Objective-C, respectively. For the android app, Google Places and Google Maps APIs were used for the mapping feature, and Mapkit was used for the iOS app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The APIs were surprisingly difficult to work with, and getting the API keys to work properly was a roadblock. Getting the data to persist was another challenge at first.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Almost none of this worked the first (or second or third) time, and I'm proud of our team for persevering until it did work.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Android Studio had a much steeper learning curve than I was hoping, but I was able to use this weekend as time to read all about it and go through several tutorials, and now I think I'm getting the hang of it. -Sam</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hometown</h2>\n<p>We have a lot in mind for Hometown in the future. One cool feature would be using NFC and/or a QR-code type of system to quickly add friends who already have an account in the app. We still want to stay away from importing friends in bulk, but making the input process easier would be nice.\nAlso, a long-term idea would be to let travel companies (American Airlines, MegaBus, etc.) pay for access to users' data (with their permission) and use it to advertise relevant trips within the app. For example, if I have 7 friends with hometowns in Chicago, I might get a notification from MegaBus that there's a sale on tickets to Chicago this weekend.

It can also log medicines for you with phrases like \"I just took 1 dose of Tylenol,\" to make sure that you are taking the correct dosage every day.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/fhir\">fhir</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-dynamodb\">amazon-dynamodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["wyshlist", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wyshlist \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/847/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wyshlist \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/827/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wyshlist \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/824/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wyshlist \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/825/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wyshlist \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/826/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wyshlist \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/822/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>My Amazon wishlist is unfortunately effective at emptying my bank account on the internet, and being able to do that in real life seemed like a pretty solid business plan</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>wyshlist lets users pick categories of items they're interested in buying (\"A new jacket,\" \"A pair of boots\") and then uses iBeacons to connect them to deals at their favorite stores</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Bootstrap, Angular, Haskell, Bluetooth LE.

The launcher itself consists of two counter-rotating wheels, a magazine tube, a barrel, and a push rod to activate a shot.</p>\n<p>The pan and tilt mechanism operates using one stepper motor per axis. Each stepper motor drives a timing belt which has ends fixed to a cylinder on the underside of each rotating axis. With 2026 total steps per revolution of each machine axis, this provides an accurate means of positioning the launcher. Concerns include over-travel as the pulley system is not a continuous loop. A potential fix is to keep track of absolute machine coordinates and relative machine coordinates, but has not been implemented due to time constraints.</p>\n<p>The launcher mechanism went through an iterative design phase. The original goal being to launch Skittles, we pursued two parallel development paths: the first being the launcher currently used, and the second being a system based on a rotating disk attached to a fan motor taken from a microwave. </p>\n<p>The second option had many drawbacks, one of them including the issue of shattering Skittles on contact instead of launching them. It also had no way to vary the angular velocity of the disk, which would severely limit tuning and distance compensation. This option was abandoned early on in favor of the counter-rotating wheel mechanism.</p>\n<p>The final launcher presented consists of two counter-rotating brushless DC motors. Adhesive foam on the outside of the motors allows the system to grip the candy being fed into it and also takes up some of the variability in the size and shake of the candy. Candy is fed into a vertical magazine tube which deposits a single candy into the chamber. A servo acts as a push rod to manipulate the candy into the wheels while blocking the magazine. When the push rod retracts, another candy drops into the chamber. The wheels accelerate the candy and the candy gets funneled into the barrel.

So, why don\u2019t we have the access to our own browsing analysis?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Iwantoknow.me monitors browser activities, then organizes and presents the data collected in a simple and intuitive way. The responsive interface allows users to accurately identify the time spent at browsing different sites using the graph. Iwantoknow.me also comes in handy when the users intend to tune their lifestyle by notifying the users whenever too much time is spent on a certain domain. What makes it stands out is that when the users overspent their time on the Internet or a certain pages, Iwantoknow.me will notify the users regarding the overspent issue rather than blocking the selected browser. We purposely designed it this way because the users might need to use the blocked website for important matters.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our main priority was to get the information about the actual time you spend on a website, since there is no tool that does this (most tool just gives us the  number of time you visit a website, but that does not accurately measure time). We ran into many challenges in gathering this data, working with (and against) chrome's API (which was not build for this solution in mind). We found that there are many cases that we would not want to count a user as \"actively\" visiting a site (i.e. if they opened a tab, but not actually use it).</p>\n<p>Another challenge that we have was integrating with current offline web data storage. Since we would be recording a lot of user action in the browser (i.e. every tab and window change), we would be storing large amounts of data. Most offline web storage technology allows only small amounts of data to be stored (i.e. localStorage allow ~5Mb). We found the new IndexedDB technology useful to us (albeit quite low level), and we manage to model, abstract, and store our data with it.</p>\n<p>Besides collecting data, we also want to be able to present users with useful data about their browsing time and history. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We completed the chrome extension, published the app on the chrome web store and launched a landing page that introduces the app. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Always think of a few plans ahead, just in case the first plan didn't work out.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Iwantoknow.me</h2>\n<p>We hope to be able to determine the top 5 topics the users always look for in the browsers and recommend websites based on their interest while not affecting their productivity. For example, we can suggest websites that are more related to study or work materials in comparison to entertainment or social based websites. We also intend to integrate this extension with other to do lists and online calendars so that it reminds the user that there is something more important to be done when the user is spending too much time on a certain website. Last but not least, we wish to implement a leaderboard system for users to compete with each other and motivate themselves to be more productive.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dc.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bower\">bower</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/crossfilter\">crossfilter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indexed-db</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://iwantoknow.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://iwantoknow.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>iwantoknow.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sysofwan/iwantoknowme\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sysofwan/iwantoknowme\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iwantoknowme/faeemphknooeafmhbpjpaajneebagbjh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iwantoknowme/faeemphknooeafmhbpjpaajneebagbjh\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>chrome.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["WhoShotWhom", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There's a lot of crime data out there, and its hard for police officers to make sense out of it, simply by looking at an excel sheet.

This way, a user can spend less time worrying about when to take medicine or get refills and spend more time focusing on other activities.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The foundation for our application is the C# language and the .NET Framework. None of the project members on our team knew C# or had had prior experience working with the .NET Framework. We used the EPIC database called FHIR to get the information from our customers that we needed for our application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Because we did not know what we were getting into, we ran into a series of problems that held our project back considerably. One major issue was that we originally started the project in the wrong form meaning we had to transfer all our code over. This caused way more issues than expected and set us behind drastically since nearly all the code we had written had to be converted over to the proper project setup. Visual Studio also proved to be challenging to learn since we were all new to the language and the IDE as well.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>While our project did not turn out as expected, we gained an incredible amount of experience working with .NET and with C#. We also learned about the different types of Windows projects and how to properly setup a project for the application we intend to build. We also did have an almost running prototype that we are proud of because of all the effort we put into the project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Epic Reminders</h2>\n<p>Due to the current constraints, we do not have any immediate plans to move forward with Epic Reminders.

They can specify the name, number of sets, and number of reps when creating an exercise entry. There is also a Progression feature which allows users to take a photo of themselves after every workout and save it to the app's gallery. Once users reach their fitness goals, they can view the progression of their physique through all the photos they have taken.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Swift to write the app on Xcode 7 and used Adobe Photoshop to make UI elements and graphics.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was my first iOS app and it was very difficult to build, mainly because I was unfamiliar with the syntax of Swift. It was also tedious to look through Apple's APIs and try to find out what exactly was going on in my code.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud that I was able to make my first iOS app. Also this is my first collegiate hackathon and the first time I ever completed a personal computer science related project without aborting or giving up.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned the basics of Swift and Xcode. I also learned how to access and use APIs of other companies and integrate their features into my app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BuffBro</h2>\n<p>I hope to improve <em>BuffBro</em> sometime in the future by adding more features such as multiple workout plans, Facebook login integration, and workout schedules.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/adhityav/BuffBro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/adhityav/BuffBro\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Scan-N-Solve Sudoku", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scan-N-Solve Sudoku \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/008/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scan-N-Solve Sudoku \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/009/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scan-N-Solve Sudoku \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/010/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is an android app that detects a sudoku grid in image and then solves it.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used opencv to detect the grid by running computations like contour mapping, edge detection and thresholding.

At first we wanted to create some application that would take music files and use the frequency data to play Pok\u00e9mon or Super Smash or something like that. Then we wanted to be able to stream the presidential debate and pipe that input into a boxing game. The common ground of these two ideas is that we are taking something that is typically <strong>output</strong> and using it as <strong>input</strong> in an interesting way. From these two ideas, we found an achievable middle ground that turned into what is Tweet Fighter.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The heart of Tweet Fighter is analyzing twitter data and visualizing it by using it to control Street Fighter II Turbo. The application starts by a user tweeting at our twitter account. The user tweets two opposing keywords (e.g. 'cubs' and 'mets') as well as a time frame. Our twitter bot takes those two keywords, searches twitter and gathers recent tweets about them. It then pipes the tweets through the sentiment140 sentiment analyzer API to get data on which tweets were <em>for</em> or <em>against</em> each. Once those are tabulated, they are used to generate a set of moves that the Street Fighter bot executes. A video of the fight is recorded and uploaded to our Microsoft Azure CDN. Finally, a link to the video on the CDN is tweeted back to the user and the user can finally know who would win in a street fight, Cubs or Mets!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>TweetFighter has two primary components: the Python twitter bot and the Street Fighter emulator module. The twitter bot has three modules. The module to search tweets, the module to apply the sentiment140 API, the module to process the data, and the module to upload the video and tweet back at the user. For these modules we used the twitter, sentiment140, and Azure APIs. The emulator module uses Lua scripting to control the game and Python to generate keyboard events for other controlling.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/leviathan747/TweetFighterIITurbo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leviathan747/TweetFighterIITurbo\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Houdini", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Houdini</h1>\n<p>Escape those awkward conversations</p>\n<p>Ever been in an awkward or boring conversation with somebody, and just need an escape?

We also just got a new Apple TV dev kit. What came next came naturally. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We emulate the <em>entire</em> Nintendo DS system on the Apple TV and map the DS controls to the Siri remote. There's a fully functioning d-pad, as well as a and b button emulation. Due to hardware restrictions beyond our control, we're not able to emulate the shoulder buttons. Other than that, it will run nearly every single DS game that you load into it.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We based NitrogenTV off the popular open source DS emulation project for PC called Desmume. Since the project is open source, we had a decent jumping off point. We then basically went through and ported over all the emulation layers, then the threaded interpreter, and finally built controller support and UI on top of it. We wanted to port the lightning JIT system over for even faster emulation but didn't have time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Since the Apple TV isn't even out yet, there was zero documentation for issues that we ran into. We had to figure everything out ourselves through tons of trial and error. It was literally the wild west.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The fact that everything seems to be working is an accomplishment. We managed to figure out the Siri controller, which had tons of weird and undocumented behavior. We managed to make basic sense of the Desmume source. We managed to get past Xcode's many issues and finally get something to build.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Porting things is very tiresome. You might think it's easy since the source is right there, but that's not the case at all, especially when you're building for completely different architectures.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NitrogenTV</h2>\n<p>We'll see!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple-tv</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">brains</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Walmart Store Helper", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Often times, I would find myself lost at Wal-Mart.

The lists are then sent to our HTML page through an API call in Flask. The Google Maps JS API then takes over and posts each location on a clustering map.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>This was built with a Flask backend, API calls to a Python script which grabs tweets and returns them through an HTTP GET call to an address, where the front end grabs the response. The JS then translates the array of geolocations to GPS coordinates, which are used to place markers on a map utilizing the Google Maps JS API. The map clusters the markers for readability sake.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>We had many struggles-when least expected-with both of the API's we were utilizing. It took a lot of time to get working code for both Twitter and Google Maps because of their steep learning curve. We also really struggled with correctly making and handling an HTTP Get call in Flask. Working with our JSON object was rough- it took us a while to realize the string to object function wasn't built into the jQuery command. It also took us too much time in our final hours to discover some errors we encountered were caused by hitting the limit of API calls we could make to the Geocoding API.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We're proud that we actually managed to get everything working. It was touch and go for a while and there were times that it looked like we wouldn't finish, but at the end of this event we have a working website (with very limited responsiveness).</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>Nick learned how to use Flask, Twitter's API, and JSON operations: \"I'm super glad I got the chance to learn these technologies here at BoilerMake.\" Morgan furthered his skills in JavaScript/jQuery, Google Maps JS API (Geocoding, Marker Cluster, Map/Marker Creation), JSON, and minor back-end knowledge. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Trend Tracker</h2>\n<p>We've discussed adding in information from the 2010 census to get demographic information and let you know a little about the area the tweet is coming from. We also plan to figure out how to get out of the limited API calls (trust us, we tried everything would could to overcome in the last few hours). There is definitely a lot of potential in parsing through the geolocation of any open data; especially when used in a clustering map.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the BoilerMake Organizers!

A single tap allows the user to flip \"card\" over and see then answer or flip the card back to the original side. A force tap allows the user to navigate to the next card in the deck. The force touch starts by navigating to a confirmation page. From this, the user can click above or on the text to go to the next card or press below the text to remain on the current card. After finishing the final card of the deck, another force touch will return the user to the first card of the deck.

Students who have never written a line of code before college find code intimidating. Tools like gdb, valgrind, gcc are 'scary' and have a ton of technical verbiage associated with them. Moreover, using these tools while learning and applying the basic and advanced concepts of a language like C in the classroom makes it hard for students to enjoy coding and really develop a passion for it. It doesn't help that ECE labs are usually full in the evenings with students from various courses. </p>\n<p>We set out to solve this problem and introduce a change in the way coding IS or CAN be taught everywhere.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>ACCESS</strong> is an educational IDE of sorts. It helps students hit the ground running while learning or writing code. We give them a text editor to write their code and a basic file system on a profile page to manage projects. All students have to do is write code and press buttons to compile, run, test or edit their code.</p>\n<p>Our project simplifies coding for entry level students in three major ways</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>GDB and Valgrind</strong>: With the press of a button, students can compile and test their code. The ton of verbiage with these two tools to check code correctness and memory leaks is no more. We give a simplified, directed, easy-to-read output for students to read and then fix their code accordingly. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Version Control</strong>: With the click of a 'commit' button, students can create different versions of their code without any git commands and can see these versions as separate tabs in our front-end interface.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Function Replacement</strong> - Lets say my project contains 10 functions. Well what if want to test my code without actually completing each one? what If i want to check an error in my code but cant pinpoint which function its in? I simply have to click the 'Test' tab, turn any functions i dont want to be compiled from my code 'OFF' and those functions will be replaced by a function in the answer key securely stored in our back end.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>With this we hope to introduce three major changes in the classroom:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>More focus on coding tools like debugging, version control and memory checks.</li>\n<li>Partial grading or partial analysis of code.</li>\n<li>Analysis of code failures, function failures provided as statistical data to the teacher, to provide a better guide as to the content for the next lecture.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our project is essentially a <strong>Django</strong> web application.\nWe use a Bootstrap framework for a front end - which uses Django views to talk to a database through an API. The Database then talks to a Back end which uses Docker as a virtual machine.\nFor a diagram of how our project is built refer to\n<a href=\"http://s22.postimg.org/8z9r71rdd/arch.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://s22.postimg.org/8z9r71rdd/arch.png</a></p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenges we ran into were</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Function Replacement</strong> - How to make django and the database recognize the answer key to a project and replace those functions when needed.</li>\n<li><strong>Writing scripts to simplify Valgrind and GDB output</strong></li>\n<li><strong>BUGS</strong> - Mainly among the user-interface (in Bootstrap) talking to Django using Javascript and Jquery.</li>\n<li><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong> - Due to a time constraint, we could not complete the statistical analysis part of our project. \nIdeally we would record each failure, each success, each time a particular functions is 'on' or 'off' among many other types of data where we analyze HOW students code. This information in the hands of professors would ultimately help guide the content and flow of coding lectures. However, we decided to use the time we had left in making our application as stable as possible before attempting to put new features in it.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I think the team really got into the spirit of coding and learned what developing something (trying to) from start to finish feels like. As a whole we learnt a lot about web development, with its various tricks and challenges. Each of us had a role, from front-end development, to database management, to  back-end scripting. And we constantly shifted roles among one another to help our fellow teammates. Coding as a team, fostering both teamwork and friendship and building something to be hopefully used one day in the real world, reminded us of why we got into coding in the first place. </p>\n<h2>What's next for ACCESS</h2>\n<p>Our next step would be to further stabilize our platform and add the statistical analysis feature to it. We can then start to add languages other than C. And maybe sometime in the far future, we can turn this into a collaboration space for code, like Google Docs. We can also start talking to various professors in entry level programming classes at Purdue to see whether they would be interested in sponsoring or helping us test this tool on a live classroom. Thanks to the networking skills of one of our teammates, we are already in discussion with a few professors in the ECE department, thanks to which we got an ECN machine to develop on. As a whole, we really want to be able to implement something that will help students in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ee220cpc1.ecn.purdue.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ee220cpc1.ecn.purdue.edu/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ee220cpc1.ecn.purdue.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front End Developer for ACCESS. \nSkill Set - Django, Python , JS, Jquery, HTML5 (Bootstrap), CSS, Ruby", "I created the entire backend for ACCESS.\n\nUsing Python scripts that I wrote, it runs gcc and GDB/Valgrind as required by the user, parses the output for the key information and presents ONLY this key information to the user as part of a simple, minimalistic error message.", "I'm so proud of leading this amazing team to build ACCESS!!\n", "", ""]], ["Perf Pitch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Perf Pitch \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/587/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Perf Pitch \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/588/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Perf Pitch \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/589/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In addition to software engineering, I also am getting a degree in music. Having played the violin for over 15 years, I love making and listening to music. Something that has always helped in my practice and performance is perfect pitch, my ability to know pitches without needing a reference. It helps keep my intonation much more consistent that typical. With this app, I hope to help others develop this skill that I know they will appreciate acquiring.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It offers two practice methods. The first has the user <strong>listen</strong> to the played pitch and touch the appropriate piano key (located on the screen) to see if he/she is correct. The second has the user <strong>sing</strong> into the phone, then plays that against the actual tone to see how correct/incorrect he/she is.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used my recently acquired skills in iOS app development and Swift to create this. I started with a lengthy brainstorming process then executed small goals that amounted to the final product.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were many things I did not know how to do before I began (i.e. audio recording, audio playback). Luckily, I had great resources to help, such as various examples found online and the Apple employees who gave me guidance in solving my problems and improving the project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am very proud of the app's appearance; it looks very simple and elegant. I am also happy that I got the audio functions to work.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about working with iOS and Swift. I also got to experience my first hackathon and now know how I should plan for success in my next one!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Perf Pitch</h2>\n<p>I'd <em>love</em> to implement an FFT to the recorded WAV file so that the user's pitch can be determined. I think that would really take it to the next level. Another avenue to take with this project would be adding more statistics so that the user can track progress.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yuhaw-su/Boilermake2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yuhaw-su/Boilermake2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the entire app within the 36-hour hackathon window."]], ["EZSched", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/725/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/726/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/729/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/731/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/695/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/675/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/674/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EZSched \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/306/696/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>EZSched</h1>\n<hr/>\n<h3>Problem</h3>\n<p>Discovering groups of interest is tedious and difficult in the modern day and age. Bombarded with too many, it can be hard to find the right group of people... especially as a college student. Fumbling with classes, homework, tests, and activities, it's not hard to imagine the difficulties that college students have when trying to get involved in new groups of interest. With over 1000+ registered student organization at UIUC alone, it's a whirlwind just trying to pick and choose which ones to attend.</p>\n<h3>Solution</h3>\n<p>Often times students end up trying out 10-20+ clubs, only to end up becoming regulars to a select few. EZSched is designed to minimize the wasted time that's spent going to clubs that seemed to be a good fit, but in reality were not. By allowing users and organizations to input their schedules and relevant interests, we can cross-reference their schedules and suggest different club activities and events for users to attend. Effectively EZSched helps our users save valuable time by eliminating the out-dated process of manually finding, picking, and trying out groups of interest.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gruan/EZSched\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gruan/EZSched\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Purdue Open Labs", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Find out what labs in Lawson are open so you can get access to a lab computer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coffeescript\">coffeescript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mikekhalil/OpenLabs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mikekhalil/OpenLabs\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://192.241.230.18/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://192.241.230.18/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>192.241.230.18</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on bash scripts and frontend ", "", ""]], ["Aisle Five", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Aisle Five came as an idea from two college students who hate overpaying for milk and eggs. Now we will always get the cheapest prices around. Aisle Five allows you to enter in any common grocery item and see where the cheapest places are to get it. We created Aisle Five by hosting a php server using Laravel to communicate to our web hosted and iOS client. The php server crawls a selection of common grocery stores and builds a list of items and their prices.\nAs this is our very first server driven web application, our main struggle was understanding the logistics and backbone of how a server communicates with web based and iOS clients. Along with that, configuring a server and getting hosting storage was rather tricky to debug. We are all very proud that we were able to get a live site up and running that has a minimal API running in the background to get information on grocery items. We learned how web servers work, how to write php, utilize the Laravel framework, crawl websites for information, and get/post to our php server.\nWe hope to continue this project by introducing locational services so the user can be aware of how far they will need to travel to pick up their goods. We'd also like to allow for the ability to add each of the item's you're searching into one giant grocery list. At that point you could compare the total costs for going to different stores for your items. These features would have been nice to be able to achieve during boilermake, but since this was our first web application we were content with what we managed to learn and achieve.

began looking over the hardware MLH was bringing, originally looking at the Oculus Rift, but finally focusing on the Leap Motion after seeing its unusual input method and potential for quick implementation in the Unity3D engine, allowing me time to feasibly create a fresh experience solo under the time constraints.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Uses the Leap Motion as a controller to control 3D representations of 2 players' hands.  These virtual hands are armed with thumb-mounted swords and the players essentially fence, trying to strike the other player's palms. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Hand2Hand is build in the Unity3D engine using the Leap Motion as its primary form of input.  I built off of the official Leap Motion Unity implementation for basic hand controls, writing all of my game mechanic code in C# with MonoDevelop.  Version control and backup was handled with both GitHub and Google Drive.  All models were done with standard primitives and I created all audio in Linux MultiMedia Studio.  Texturing and all other image work was done in GIMP 2.  The zip file containing the playable executable is hosted on GoogleDrive, while the source remains on GitHub.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Leap Motion is dependent on an IR camera.  The bright lighting in the fieldhouse interferes heavily with its already imperfect hand-tracking accuracy.<br/></li>\n<li>The players' swords are, unlike their hands, not physical objects in the real world.  This means that when their blades impact something in the game world, nothing causes the players to respond physically, removing the vital recoil element of a kinetically satisfying sword-fight.<br/></li>\n<li>Working solo at a largely team-focused event put me at a relative disadvantage as no progress could be made while I slept and all art/design/graphical work had to be handled by me in addition to the programming workload.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>As a substitute for kinetic feedback actually stopping the players' real hands upon impacting their targets or parrying an attack, the swords \"break\" on impact, requiring the player to remove their hands from sensor-range briefly to get a new sword.  This causes players to react in approximation to recoiling from a blow without any actual kinetic feedback.<br/></li>\n<li>Handling this project solo and reached a passable end product without nearly the sleep loss I expected starting out.<br/></li>\n<li>Several players that tested my game seemed to rather enjoy playing it, and player enjoyment is what I consider the ultimate indicator of success for a game of this nature.<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The value of mechanical and auditory elements in simulation that encourage a user to provide their own kinetic feedback where a hardware solution would be significantly more expensive, complicated, time-consuming, or otherwise impractical.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hand2Hand</h2>\n<p>I intend to purchase a Leap Motion to continue development and experiment with more than 2 players, multiple Leap Motion controllers, Leap Motion paired with Oculus Rift, and the possibility of a physical shield or a layer of image-processing that can be paired with the Leap Motion to block out bright light sources and minimize interference for maximum tracking accuracy.</p>\n<h2>Playing Hand2Hand</h2>\n<p>A playable version of the game for Windows PC is located in the .zip file on Google Drive linked on this page.  A standard keyboard and a properly set-up Leap Motion controller with all in standard face-up orientation is required to play this this game.  Leap Motion hand tracking works better in areas with lower light.  More info on Leap Motion setup can be found at <a href=\"https://www.leapmotion.com/setup\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.leapmotion.com/setup</a>.

It is a tremendous thing to be part of the spaceflight community. Many of us were inspired by the feats of space programs of last century to become engineers, scientists, and technologists- as such, this project represents the inspiration that binds us all together!</p>\n<p>We seek to connect people who love space or have a yearning to learn to the technology to fuel their passions by being connecting the Astronauts and Cosmonauts. The low cost nature of this hack allows us to connect people in developing nations with enthusiasm for the future!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Inspiration Watch uses telemetry data from the International Space Station to project its course across in any room, even as big as Lambert Field-house, as it orbits the Earth. The use of a laser beam allows the user to watch the exact path it takes across the sky from their point of view. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using a 200 step (1.8 degree/step) stepper motor and HS-311 servo, we were able to create a two degree of freedom platform. An arduino Uno and Adafruit Motor Shield V2 were used to drive them. The arduino software parses the ISS real-time flight data via connection to NASA servers and drives the stepper for full 360 degree field of view in the angular direction. The servo motor projects the laser beam in the radial direction to display the location of the ISS on the ceiling or walls of the room. </p>\n<p>A python program is written on a small computer to access the servers and communicate through a serial connection the arduino, as it is not wifi capable. </p>\n<p>A .5W laser is used to display the location and features a power switch for optimal control.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Collectively, we faced several challenges. We really wanted to do a hardware hack of sorts, but the relative lack of resources was very difficult. We pivoted several times from other servo-arduino projects before settling on a good prospective idea. The communication type and parsing from python to the arduino served as a key challenge to make sure the data types lined up and were read into the correct fashion. We hit barriers with backed-up data streams interfering with incoming data resulting in a failure of the program. Flushing out the serial lines after each parseFloat allowed us to stop this issue and have regular communication periods with the arduino. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the arduino motor library limits the accuracy of the displayed laser. Since a stepper motor has steps of 1.8 degrees, we had to determine the optimal time discretization to minimize error accumulation from dropping decimals. The servos require a integer angle so optimizing the servo's requirements and the stepper's requirements was non-trivial.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We created a functional, accurate representation of where the ISS is in the sky at any given time. I plan to make one of these 3D printed for myself and open-source the code to allow anyone with basic github knowledge to make on at home themselves. Open sourcing this information gives me pride since many projects similar to this are restricted access or require payment. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Serial communication issues interfacing with python and how the serial monitor acts when you submit information to it. Also motor control with an arduino motor shield. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Inspiration Watch</h2>\n<p>We plan to open source this code on SteveMacenski's github to allow easy access to anyone and have clear step-by-step instructions in making one for yourself (including CAD models of structural components)! Also I plan to refine the structure and make it a permanent addition to my home, lab, and life. </p>\n<p>The opportunity to work on this project has allowed me to complete a project I have wanted to make for years and gives me joy to share our passion of space with the generation shaped by its impact on society. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SteveMacenski/BoilerMake---ISS-Tracker-Hack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SteveMacenski/BoilerMake---ISS-Tracker-Hack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Completed the arduino code and contributed to an orbital mechanics python library.

We aimed to change that this year and add some pumpkin spice to the usual hardware hacks (pun intended).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When you tap the jack-o-lantern, it snaps your picture, adds some festive stickers and a witty caption, and tweets it via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PumpkinPiPics\" rel=\"nofollow\">@PumpkinPiPics</a>.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Raspberry Pi with a camera module to implement the camera. It uses a capacitive touch sensor breakout board to detect when someone taps the pumpkin. Then it captures the image data, applies a random sticker and chooses a random caption, and uploads it to Twitter.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We initially planned it to be entirely wireless, using batteries for power and WiFi for tweeting. However, we discovered that the batteries only lasted a few minutes per charge and that WiFi doesn't perform well inside water-based organisms like pumpkins. There probably won't be an Internet-of-Pumpkins anytime soon.</p>\n<p>We also didn't expect to have so many issues with debugging the capacitive touch sensor. After many grueling hours of debugging, we discovered that we couldn't use AC-DC wall adapters, only fully DC power supplies (like a laptop), because otherwise the sensor would read too much noise.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Developing a deep appreciation for the art and science of pumpkin hacking</li>\n<li>Having a legitimate reason to plug a pumpkin into Ethernet</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Finally understanding some of Electricity &amp; Magnetism physics</li>\n<li>How to pick a good pumpkin for hacking</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Trick or Tweet</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The next PCs. A personal selfie pumpkin (PSP) in every pocket/purse/briefcase/backpack in the month of October.</li>\n<li>Then: expanding to other holidays; turkeys? elves? rabbits?
