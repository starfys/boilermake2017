[["Gaitorade", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to develop a  product that would make an impact to the health care system and attack some of the common problems people face these days.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our product Gaitorade, does the analysis of how a person places his/her foot while standing/walking. ( gait analaysis). It maps the pressure points over a person's foot sole and has many applications in the field of health care. For now, along with the plantar analysis, it detects the presence of Parkinson disease where the legs of patient are effected. Gaitorade software also allows the user to message directly to the doctor to notify him about the progress in healing.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Myo was worn in legs for the development in this project. Myo is generally used for gesture detection tasks and it is worn in hands. We broke the convention and wore it in legs to demonstrate its capabilities in the health care domain.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As the Myo has been developed for gesture detection tasks, most interfaces to Myo give an access only to the data after some basic detection APIs. As we had changed the way Myo has been used, we had to start the development from scratch and hack into Myo to get the raw sensor values from hardware and then do the filtering and processing tasks to get our output.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our product can accurately detect and measure the few stances planned by us and has shown promising results for the further development to cover other positions as well. It can also detect the presence of Parkinson disease in the user.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Nor me or my team had worked on EMG sensors before and learning to operate it so well in 1 day and then using if for a noble domain was a wonderful experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gaitorade</h2>\n<p>This product has infinite scopes open ahead. The future tasks include learning algorithms for detection of detailed foot placements and walk patterns, auto-detection of few of the common diseases/issues, and usage of on board IMU for various fitness tracking tasks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Idea for intended application, Integration of Myo to meet the target usage, Raw data feed hack, Foot pressure map Algorithm development, medical impact and applications", "Conceptualization of the idea, Developed Java Swings Interface and the algorithm for Foot Pressure-map, Modelling and Visualization", "Worked out the mathematics, devised the algorithm for the pressure mapping, conceptualization of applications, program debugging"]], ["SemQuery", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SemQuery \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/993/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SemQuery \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/994/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SemQuery \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/995/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SemQuery \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/996/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SemQuery \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/997/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>SemQuery - Semantic Code Search Engine</h1>\n<p>SemQuery is a semantic code search engine for querying codebases using structure and semantics instead of conventional textual search.

We found that skin cancer is one of the most prevalent diseases in the United States, with five million people being treated each year and one in five Americans developing it in a lifetime. Additionally, we knew that although early detection of skin cancer leads to the greatest chance of survival and better treatment options, many Americans may be reluctant to check with their doctors due to the time commitment, great cost of doctor visits (especially without insurance), and personal reasons, such as privacy.</p>\n<p>Knowing this, we wanted to make a tool that people could easily use at home to check privately whether or not they were at risk of skin cancer. We were further encouraged by one of our teammates, who had several potentially cancerous moles removed as a child but still had some moles remaining.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MoleML is a cross-platform mobile application which puts the power of machine learning into the hands of everyday users. MoleML allows users to take or submit a picture of a mole that they suspect is cancerous. A self-developed algorithm analyzes the image and makes a prediction whether or not the mole is cancerous, also providing a confidence level. MoleML then allows users to track their moles over time, providing data and graphs as visual aids to help determine whether or not the moles are becoming more dangerous.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>MoleML was developed using Adobe\u2019s Phonegap, which builds the Android, iOS, and Windows versions of the mobile app from the framework we created in HTML/CSS/JQuery. It first allows users to take or upload a picture from gallery of a mole. This image is then sent to a server and processed by a Random Forest Classifier, a machine learning algorithm that integrates OpenCV and is trained on a public, HIPAA-compliant data set containing over a thousand images of potentially cancerous moles. The algorithm returns its prediction and confidence, calculated by analyzing up to ten parameters of both the mole and the user. This prediction may be improved by the user providing basic data that may put them at greater risk of skin cancer. Then, data of each test are saved in a Parse database and visually plotted with Charts.js.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were a great many challenges that we faced in the course of creating such a technically intensive app. We spent many hours creating the machine-learning algorithm, processing images accurately, setting up our servers to successfully run data sent by users through the algorithm, as well as creating a polished and functional UI.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Above all, we are proud that we were able to create an app that could be useful for millions of Americans in just 36 hours. MoleML may not only save millions of Americans time and money but also warn them if they are at great risk of a life-threatening disease.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Not only did we learn a myriad of technical skills, such as working with databases and algorithms, we also learned that we could feasibly create a working app with the potential to help millions of people in just a day and a half of hard work (and no sleep).</p>\n<h2>What's next for MoleML</h2>\n<p>We are hoping to further refine our algorithm to provide results with greater accuracy. In addition, we want to provide options to contact doctors and dermatologists about results, and more detailed statistics about the user\u2019s health.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phonegap\">phonegap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud-computing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">big-data</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JoeAzar/MoLe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JoeAzar/MoLe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Created the logo, aided UI/UX design", "Coded entire front end, as well as all js back-end code (e.g. Parse SDK).

The glasses vibrate when your eyes close for too long, and also causes your Pebble watch to vibrate. </p>\n<h2>How it was built</h2>\n<p>DigitalCoffee was built with an arduino, photon, pebble, and android phone. The arduino processes all of the information, and the photon uploads the information to a server. The server sends data to your phone, which in turn forwards the data via bluetooth to the pebble. </p>\n<p>The IR sensors detect eye movement - blink frequency and duration. There is also a tilt sensor to detect head motion. The vibration motors trigger as long as the sensors detect signs of sleeping. The blink information is forwarded to the phone app for analytics; one can see when he/she is most sleepy. Lastly, the pebble app displays raw values and alerts you via vibration/notification.</p>\n<p>The glasses were designed and 3d printed. We used multiple breadboards, wires, and parts to do everything. Also included: a button to calibrate the IR sensors.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting all the hardware to work properly. The biggest challenge was getting the photon to accept and transmit data from the Arduino Uno. We ran into some serious problems with transmission using RX and TX pins, but we were able to use I2C instead. It would have been much harder without Pennapps' great mentors. The hardware was also hard to calibrate as there were multiple issues with sensitivity. </p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Minimizing the cables, making the entire module more wireless/light, more analytics and information, various smart options controlled via blinking. If this was designed as a product, it would be much less bulky, with a similar, if not smaller profile than Google Glass. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photon</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ir-sensor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CyrusRoshan/DigitalCoffee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CyrusRoshan/DigitalCoffee\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built all of the Arduino electronics/wiring and wrote the basic Arduino program.

However, not all children develop reading skills at the same rate; as a result, some children may fall behind as they are asked to approach picture-less stories.  The same idea also applies to those attempting to learn a new language; pictures help to illustrate the point while not giving the answer completely away.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Illustratr is a web service that automatically generates illustrations for a given piece of text.  After illustrations are generated, an easy-to-use interface allows the user to view the illustrations inline with the text, as though it were a complete book.  Part of that interface includes the ability to detect swipe gestures, denoting turn pages and maintaining an interactive part of reading.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The process begins with a natural language processing algorithm built with nltk that segments the text into \"scenes\", where each scene will have one illustration.  After that, key words falling under one of four categories are extracted: context (background), subject, verb, object.  With these key words, the Bing Image Search API is used to collect candidate images for each of these categories; the candidates are ranked based on defining factors (i.e. the subject ideally has an easily removable background) and the top candidate is selected to form the final product.

We take common forms offered by the IRS (e.g. W-9) in PDF format, parse the form into plain text and apply foreign-language translation. We then display the form as easy-to-read questions to the user that they answer in simple one-line responses. Finally, we auto-populate the PDF form and provide the completed form to the user. It's that simple!</p>\n<p>Formfor.me targets a wide range of demographics and responds to the need of increased inclusion in the American legal system. We envision helping those whose first language is not necessarily English, who find themselves struggling to understand confusing instructions, and who are not computer-savvy.</p>\n<p>In the future, we'd like to extend this service beyond IRS forms to include more general government forms as well as more non-trivial applications such as reimbursement forms or college applications.</p>\n<p>We deployed the Formfor.me backend using Microsoft Azure as a Python/Flask API on an Ubuntu VM.

However, one may almost say they're lucky, as they were people who figured out the had concussions and were able to have them treated. Almost <strong>half</strong> of all athletes don't report feeling symptoms after receiving a concussive blow, and a total of <strong>1.6-3.8 million concussions</strong> occur in the United States every year (estimated by the CDC)l</p>\n<p>In order to address the major problem of concussions in youth sports, adult sports, and the mayhem of everyday life, we realized that a better system was needed - one that could be <strong>close and accessible</strong>, <strong>affordable</strong> for all teams, and <strong>easy to use</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>HeadsUp uses a common diagnostic methodology, <em>the tracking of patient's eye movements in response to stimuli</em>. The difference between HeadsUp and the cheapest hospital equipment? A <strong>factor of almost 100</strong>. Commercial hospital equipment runs $5,000 at minimum, and can run up to $25,000, which would mean HeadsUp was a <strong>factor of almost 470x</strong> cheaper! The secret lies in the hardware used.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Parts list:</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> Google Cardboard: $6.99</p>\n<p><strong>2</strong> PlayStation Eye Cameras: $9.98 ($4.99/each)</p>\n<p><strong>1</strong> Spark Core: $35.00</p>\n<p><strong>4</strong> LED's: ~$2.00</p>\n<p>Total: <strong>$53.97</strong></p>\n<p>Using excess cardboard and some glue, we mounted the PS Eye cameras in the Cardboard. Then, we soldered in the LED's to the Spark Core, and it was ready to go (sans software of course).</p>\n<p>While the hardware process sounds very simple, it required many iterations to get right, and features were added as we realized the specifications needed to be tightened up.</p>\n<p>To <strong>further reduce cost</strong>, one could easily use a <strong>cheaper micro controller</strong> (e.g., the <strong>Photon</strong>, for $20, bringing the total cost down to <strong>$38.97</strong>).</p>\n<p>On the software side, we used <strong>OpenCV</strong> to track the eyes of the person being evaluated. The <strong>OpenCV OS X application</strong> is passed a data source video recorded from the <strong>PS3 Eye cameras via Syphon</strong>, an open-source <strong>OS X framework</strong> that allows applications to share video between each other. The OS X application communicates with the <strong>Spark via WiFi</strong>, and triggers the LED's to turn on or off, resulting in user eye movements, which the OpenCV algorithm then processes. After the processing, the data is <strong>sent off to the cloud via WebSockets</strong>, where doctors can <strong>view</strong> the data, <strong>manage</strong> their patients, and <strong>start and stop</strong> tests.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Tracking eyeballs and figuring out the position of the pupils in two dimensions is highly non-trivial, and it took significant amounts of time to develop an <strong>algorithm using OpenCV</strong> to build a proper eye tracking system that would tell us which direction the eyes were looking in.</p>\n<p>Integrating the <strong>OpenCV C++ app with WebSockets</strong> for the web-based \"Doctor View\" portion also proved somewhat difficult, though it was completed in the end. </p>\n<p>Our Spark also <strong>refused to connect</strong> to the WiFi for a while, so we lost some time trying to fix that. :)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The OpenCV algorithm is both <strong>quite impressive</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>surprisingly accurate</strong>. Since it also took a lot of work both in thinking about it and coding it, it makes the victory of making it work even more sweet.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>WebSockets, more about OpenCV, some hardware, Google Cardboard, the <strong>amazing value of the PS3</strong> Eye cameras, and how to explode an LED (process: don't be careful). </p>\n<h2>What's next for HeadsUp</h2>\n<p>HeadsUp will <strong>add further (IR) LED's</strong> and continue to receive eye tracking algorithm improvements for better tracking. Ideally, it will also be <strong>tested at our local high school</strong>, but that is dependent upon the feeling of the administrators. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ps3-eye</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I designed the project's website and engineered the server backend to facilitate the live feed of data coming from the headset using WebSockets and NodeJS.", "I worked on making the viewer app OS X 10.10 compatible, helped with the OpenCV algorithm, and assisted in the assembling of the hardware.

Maybe we should build a web app? A mobile app? Maybe we should play with some cool hardware? Maybe integrate some stock market data? So, we tried to design a project that would fill all the above requirements and incorporates one central theme: platypuses. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our hack has a few elements. The first is a platypus-themed video game called _ italics _Platypus vs. Stocks _italics _ that's coded in Objective-C and uses stock market data (provided by FINRA) to generate each level. The player controls a flying platypus with a Myo armband as he flies through stock trends looking for love. </p>\n<p>The next element of our hack is our \"enhanced\" platypus plush dolls; there are three in total. The first platypus, the Cyborg, has a force-sensitive resistor in his belly, a piezo buzzer in his armpit, and two LEDs for eyes. Plus, he's got an Arduino strapped to his back. The second platypus, Maze, has an Electric Imp wifi-enabled micro-controller in his back and a Hall effect sensor in his arm. The third platypus, Lovebird, has a magnet in her arm that activates Maze's sensor. </p>\n<p>When Maze and Lovebird \"hold hands\", the Electric Imp chip tweets one of 200 programming-themed pick-up lines from Maze's Twitter account. However, the Cyborg, who is all alone, is jealous of their romance and feels the need to respond. Whenever Maze tweets, one of the Cyborg's eyes glows red until he is urged to respond to Maze's tweet with a quote from _ italics _ Terminator _ italics _. Then his eye will stop glowing red and his other eye will glow green. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our video game in Objective-C using code from Myo's developer website and ten years' worth of stock market data from FINRA. We let the user select which level (each level trends stocks from a particular company) they want to play and then import the data from that company. </p>\n<p>Our plush dolls were built using various sensors and indicators along with two different micro-controllers. The Cyborg has a Spark Core on his back, two LEDs for eyes, and a force-resistant sensor in his abdomen. Maze has a Hall effect sensor in his hand and an Electric Imp WiFi enabled micro-controller embedded in his back. The micro-controllers allow the Platypuses to interact with Twitter. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we ran into was getting the Cyborg to recognize Maze's Twitter posts and allowing him to post responses. First, we tried using an Arduino Leonardo to pull and push data to and from Twitter. However, the Arduino library we were using relied on an old version of Twitter authentication. This forced us to move from Arduino to Spark Core which precipitated more problems. Specifically, we had a lot of trouble syncing our Spark Core to the online IDE. </p>\n<p>Another challenge we ran into was converting the stock market data we received from FINRA into a useable form. This required us to build a script that scraped the text file and wrote the relevant data to new files. These files were then used by Objective-C to create the levels of our video game. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud of the Twitter integration we included in our project. Although our project is a little goofy, this component has a lot of real world applications. Sending tweets in response to physical (Hall effect sensor) and digital (other tweets) stimuli is something that can be applied to a variety of situations</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Besides learning how to stay awake for absurdly long amounts of time, we learned a lot about a variety of programming languages and hardware devices. Each of us programmed in a language he had never programmed before. \nBut most importantly we learned to search before you code. Most of the time, somebody has already figured out a solution for what you're trying to do. This can drastically decrease time spent on coding and dramatically increase efficiency. The answers are out there; our job as hackers is to synthesize all those answers into one, giant creation. </p>\n<h2>What's next for The Platypus Project</h2>\n<p>Well, for one thing, sleep. We need it and we need a lot of it. </p>\n<p>We will be the first to admit that the Platypus Project is not especially useful for anything. It wasn't created to solve any pressing issue, rather it was built to introduce our team members to various pieces of software and hardware at their first hackathon. Our goal is to use this new knowledge at future hackathons to make awesome hacks. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">squirrel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/stock-market-data\">stock-market-data</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/electric-imp\">electric-imp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">processor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.platypusfriends.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.platypusfriends.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.platypusfriends.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Did the website and helped on the video game.", "Worked on hardware side, inserting sensors and controllers into the stuffed Platypuses.

We've all forgotten important files on our home computer, be it homework assignments or shopping lists. Pickup allows users' files to never be more than a few taps away. </p>\n<p>We also wanted to change how people access their files. Cloud storage has several limitations - it requires you to upload your important files to third party cloud services, not all of whom can be trusted. Even the best intentioned, most purportedly secure sites <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/27/slack-got-hacked/\" rel=\"nofollow\">are vulnerable</a>. In addition, you can only store so much on the cloud for free.</p>\n<h2>The Mission</h2>\n<p>We wanted to give users an alternative to cloud storage. Instead of the need to upload every document to the cloud or use a bulky remote desktop to view files, users should have the freedom to interact with their computer files, anytime, anywhere.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>First we perform a one time installation to pair your phone with your laptop. After that, users can SSH into their laptops (even if they're sleeping) from anywhere, at anytime with only the computer and account password. Users then have access to the full file system for either searching, using the voice command, or through our browse function. Upon finding the right file, users have the option to either upload the file to OneDrive, preview it on their phone, or send an email to themselves or any other person with the file as an attachment. Pickup supports all file types for email and uploading!</p>\n<h2>The Technology Stack</h2>\n<p>We used node.js, ASP.NET, Microsoft Azure web services to create a backend for our application. We also built a client mobile app for iOS with Objective-C.

Problems With Existing Graph Databases</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Owned by private companies with no incentive to share.</li>\n<li>Public databases are used by few people with no incentive to contribute.</li>\n<li>Large databases can\u2019t fit on one machine and are expensive to traverse.</li>\n<li>Existing distributed graph databases require all nodes to be trusted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How To Solve</h2>\n<p>Tying bitcoin directly to the knowledge graph instead of running the billing as a separate service like existing knowledge graphs actively encourages the community to contribute. If people have spare disk space or server capacity they can earn money with their space cycles, and content creators are actively rewarded for contributing high quality useful data.</p>\n<p>The graph database cryptographically signs every \"triple\" allowing for some percentage of the transaction fee to be transferred to the original creator. This encourages existing groups such as Wiki Media, or Music Brainz to integrate their data to the graph as they have a large quantity of structured data. </p>\n<p>One of the hardest problems with traditional graph databases is doing \"reconciliation\" or combining multiple data sources. \nBy having contributors to the graph being directly paid by how useful their contributions are ensures that the data will be well integrated and easy to use.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>DegDB uses a modified version of the Gossip protocol to easily be able to detect new nodes and communicate between them. This easy to join system allow for our server management tool that can easily launch Linode instances. The core service is written with Go and prefilled with data borrowed from Freebase.com for demonstration purposes.</p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>Before DegDB becomes a production service there's a lot of polish that needs to be applied. This involves quite a bit of work hardening the protocol and adding anti-abuse algorithms to stop malicious users. Expanding the number of query languages will also help drive users as supporting the top 2-3 languages will make it very easy for existing databases to integrate.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gossip</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/freebase\">freebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://degdb.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://degdb.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>degdb.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/degdb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/degdb\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://raven.fn.lc:8080/static/triples.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://raven.fn.lc:8080/static/triples.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>raven.fn.lc</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Did the Linode API integration, as well as most of the backend of the webapp in NodeJS.", "Logo, graphic design, and helped with front-end web dev using html, css, and jQuery.", "", ""]], ["Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/600/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/188/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/189/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/190/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/192/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/193/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/195/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Orbana - Data-driven Social Justice \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/502/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>INSPIRATION &amp; ORIGINS</h2>\n<p>Orbana is a platform to visualize, analyze, and respond to human trafficking. With gigabytes of illegal advertisements throughout the internet, our idea was to parse this data and display it visually, making it available to NGOs, and running statistics in order to make subtle links apparent.</p>\n<p>Why Orbana? It's not just a hipster, trendy name, but a reference to our core mission: to combat the social issues of human sex trafficking. According to Roman mythology, Orbona was the goddess of children, and had a soft spot for the orphans. She regularly granted children to parents who had lost their own children. Just as Orbona was patron of children, we want to use our big data, analysis, and processes to end human trafficking. </p>\n<h2>KEY FEATURES:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Responsive visualizations in context to other socioeconomic factors</li>\n<li>Trove of data updated daily so algorithms can provide accurate feedback</li>\n<li>Direct lines of communication to NGOs for 24/7 assistance or tips.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our primary strength is displaying complicated, convoluted data sets in understandable visualizations. Second, we update our entire database of statistics daily, and re-analyze every corner of the Earth in order to detect suspicious and dangerous patterns. We have automated systems to alert local authorities, community members, and NGO's when certain danger levels are breached. Our twitter also sends out notifications at specific NGOs and locales when our algorithms detect suspicious patterns. Third, up to 4 million men, women, and children are deceived, recruited, and shipped into slavery and abuse each year. We can't stop them on your own, so we're establishing direct lines to major partners against human trafficking so you can join us with confidence.</p>\n<h2>HURDLES &amp; COMEBACKS</h2>\n<p>The APIs we used to scrape and gather data had daily limits which slowed our progress. Nonetheless, we've collected over 7,000 sets of data from all around the world to fuel our custom algorithms and notifications. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mapbox.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">whitepages</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yahoo</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rakeshsukla53/human-trafficking\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rakeshsukla53/human-trafficking\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["StrollSafe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StrollSafe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/315/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StrollSafe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/316/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StrollSafe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/317/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StrollSafe \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/318/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StrollSafe \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/319/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>The Story</h2>\n<p>Many of us live in \"checkerboard\" cities - cities where safe and unsafe areas alternate seamlessly. Regrettably, the existence of a few high crime areas instills fear in a city's citizens, and keeps many citizens only in the regions they know. This limits a city economically, socially, and demographically, as many regions choose to keep to themselves.</p>\n<p>As a city scales, so does the potential for crime, and we believe that in a beautiful city like Philadelphia, no one should feel unsafe. StrollSafe allows its Philly users to know where and when to be cautious utilizing previous location-based crime reports. Leveraging this data, users can open up to an entire city, rather than living in fear and terror.  In the dire case where a user does feel unsafe in his/her city, s/he can click the \"I Feel Unsafe\" button to call an emergency contact or an Uber to become secure. Thus, the citizens of the city gain increased confidence in their ability to take a pleasant stroll through the city, making the city more vibrant.</p>\n<h2>The Product</h2>\n<p>StrollSafe is an Android application all about contextual maps. The application leverages EveryBlock and OpenDataPhilly data to overlay crime hotspots on top of a regular map, and as a result, features utilizing the additional context. A user enters his/her emergency contact and Uber info on first use in order to handle  emergency situations, which are quickly and intuitively reported using the \"I Feel Unsafe\" button on the bottom of the map. Each region in Philly is classified under 3 colors - green, yellow, and red based on historical crime reports. Most of the map shows green, indicating safety in these regions. Upon entrance of a red or yellow region, the user immediately knows about the relative crime in his/her current location via push notifications. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/everyblock\">everyblock</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opendataphilly\">opendataphilly</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">coffee</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">maps</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-directions\">google-directions</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-geocoding\">google-geocoding</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Kenko", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SdfDD9xpK_0?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kenko \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/532/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kenko \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/914/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kenko \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/915/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kenko \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/916/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kenko \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/917/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Take a picture of any edible item, regardless of whether it is packaged or not, and receive and track nutritional data. Using image recognition, Kenko allows you to track your daily intake of various nutrients including calories, sodium, cholesterol, etc. The application also has Apple Health Kit integration, allowing the app to store your health info in a centralized location. In addition, when you scan a food item, you also have the option of ordering more of that food item from a local restaurant.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The main iOS app frontend is built in Objective-C, and the backend is written in Node.js. We realized very early on, after several attempts, that writing our own image classifier to recognize a variety of foods would be too expensive in terms of time and computational power. Instead, we decided to use the CloudSight API to help make this process a lot easier. We then used the context provided by the CloudSight API, and used the Nutritionix API to grab information about the food's nutrition data. The architecture of the app is very simple. The user takes a picture of some food with the iPhone app, which then sends a POST request to our Node.js backend (running on a Microsoft Azure VM). The Node.js backend then handles all of the communication with the various image recognition APIs and nutrition APIs. In addition, the backend also manages all user data and stores all past queries locally. The backend also aids the iPhone app in processing nutrition requests in the background, by allowing the iPhone app to send multiple images, and then receive the nutrition data the next time the user opens the up.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We originally started by trying to write our own classifier using OpenCV. As we mentioned earlier, we realized very early on that building and training an image classifier that would identify various foods would be too difficult, time consuming, and computational expensive, as there was simply too large of a training data set to be processed and evaluated. As a result, we decided that using the CloudSight API would make our lives much simpler. We used the CloudSight API's Visual Search APIs to get context about food-related images and then later grab nutritional data. In addition, we also ran into latency issues with the CloudSight API, as the image recognition was a long, expensive process. We realized that part of the reason why the process was taking so long was because the images that were being sent by the iPhone app were very high-resolution, and also very large. We learned that bringing the resolution down brought the size of the image down significantly, and as a result we were able to get the CloudSight classifier to speed up a slight amount. The latency issues became less of a problem when we decided to change the intent of the classifier, being that the classifier would look for the main object within the image (in this case, the food), and not try and analyze all details of the entire image (e.g. the classifier would recognize additional, unnecessary, features such as the color of the table or plate that the food was sitting on).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud of the fact of how well-designed and efficient the app is, as well as the fact that Kenko is now able to identify almost all foods, as well as retrieve the relevant nutritional data with a fairly small margin of error.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned many things throughout the hackathon, but the big lesson of the day was that image classification requires a lot of computational power in order to train accurate identifiers (especially when it comes to training against a data set as large as the amount of food on Earth). </p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>We are thinking of continuing further with this project, as well as possibly shipping this app to the App Store in hopes of improving the lives of many.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cloudsight\">cloudsight</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nutritionix\">nutritionix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://usekenko.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://usekenko.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>usekenko.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did frontend and worked on the project as a whole on how the frontend and backend should interact with each other", "I wrote the Node.js backend for the app, in addition to mocked up the app's design (color palette, fonts, layout, buttons, etc.).

Your Back Thanks You,\"</a> up to 80% of Americans experience back pain at some point in their lives, and each year 15% of all adults are treated for such problems as herniated discs, spinal stenosis or lumbar pain...Back pain is notoriously difficult, and expensive, to remedy. </p>\n<h2>What <em>is</em> Pos-Chair and <em>how</em> we built it</h2>\n<p>The Pos-Chair seat cover integrates force sensors to determine a person's weight distribution on the chair. Multiple Round Force Sensors strategically placed across the cover interface directly with the Particle Core IoT chip, which communicates with the iOS and Web app via Wi-Fi to provide force data for posture analysis. Depending on the weight distribution, the user will be able to monitor the quality of his/her posture through the real-time output on our Pos-Chair iOS app. The app was created with the Particle iOS Cloud SDK and communicates with a Particle Internet Button for rapid transfer of sensor information. We have also created a web application that provides a clean presentation of our product, and offers login service allowing users to view graphical real-time data from their Pos-Chair on the web as well as through our app.</p>\n<h2>Personal connection</h2>\n<p>Our inspiration for Pos-Chair comes from personal experiences and a need we see to decrease back pain associated with sitting long hours in the workforce. With Pos-Chair, people have access to the iOS app or web application which will notify them how to correct their sitting position. With practice, users can identify a correct sitting position, improve their posture long-term and decrease risk of pain and more serious back problems at a relatively low cost. Because Pos-Chair is a cover for a chair it can be used on any chair and is transportable. No sensors are attached to the person. Pos-Chair cover has application to help employees work better because with good back positioning they experience decreased discomfort and pain. As a team comprised of undergraduate and Ph.D students, we have identified application for Pos-Chair in any situation which requires the user to sit whether that be in a class lecture, at a research desk, at work, or at home.</p>\n<p>When people decide to use Pos-Chair, they are correcting their posture - reducing pain and risks such as herniated discs, spinal stenosis and lumbar pain - and improving their overall health with cutting edge technology at the forefront of ergonomics.</p>\n<h2>Obstacles</h2>\n<p>We experienced a number of unforeseen setbacks such as outdated API\u2019s and malfunctioning hardware during our time at PennApps. Our most significant obstacle was compatibility between our distance sensor, an Adruino Uno, and our Sparkcore, which inhibited us from obtaining certain posture-related information.</p>\n<h2>Our accomplishments</h2>\n<p>There was a critical point during our project when we made the decision to abandon our relentless efforts with a particular distance sensor. However, our ability to work together as a team of innovators allowed us to bypass the problem by implementing other hardware in a unique way to obtain other valuable posture-related information.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Over the past two days, we were extremely lucky to be able to interact with some of the best hackers in the world. From iOS to Particle to web server operations, each of us was able to pursue our own interests while creating a societally beneficial project with advice from both our peers and leading industry experts. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Pos-Chair</h2>\n<p>In order to make our cross-platform app more powerful, we plan to connect more sensors to our Particle IoT device. This would provide us with more information of the user\u2019s long-term habits, needs, and progress, thus enabling the app to suggest improved ways in mitigating posture-related pain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">round-force-sensors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">html/css</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">canvas-js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-chart\">google-chart</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">spark-api-for-node.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Pos-Chair/*\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Pos-Chair/*\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Pepper - She knows about your money", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pepper - She knows about your money \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/984/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pepper - She knows about your money \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/133/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pepper - She knows about your money \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/131/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pepper - She knows about your money \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/132/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pepper - She knows about your money \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/987/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pepper - She knows about your money \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/986/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What is Pepper?</h2>\n<p>Pepper is a personal banking assistant.

Oftentimes, local residents are the only ones that truly know the degree of safety of certain areas. So whether it was when Juliana had to walk late at night by herself after hanging out with friends, or when Ian accidentally walked through an unsafe neighborhood on his way home from an internship in California, the issue remains the same: lack of knowledge about the safety of certain areas is the main cause of stress and feelings of insecurity. SafeWalk leverages the information available from local communities for the promotion of public safety.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SafeWalk allows users to find out the areas that are more unsafe, due to lack of street lighting and/or increased crime. SafeWalk crowdsources the information of street lighting by allowing users to drop pins on certain locations on a map and connect the pin to a description of the area's lighting. The app uses the Everyblock API to search for articles related to local crime in an area and also drop these pins on their location. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>SafeWalk was built using Swift, Javascript, Google Maps API, Linode, MongoDB, Everyblock, and Finra.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we used GMSMapKit, but we ran into difficulties with running the code on all of our different laptops. We eventually figured out a solution to the GoogleMaps API because it allowed us to best showcase our product in the limited timeframe.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully integrated Google Maps into our product so that users can find areas that are unsafe.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned about rapid prototyping and product design. By collaborating with three other team members, we all learning the importance of using Git and communicating with each other to get our work done.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SafeWalk</h2>\n<p>Several of the features currently implemented could be polished up in the future, including the algorithm for finding several alternative safer path or finding the single safest path. In the future, we hope to incorporate Uber's service into our application so that if someone feels unsafe walking in a street, he/she is able to call an Uber directly from our app at ease. We could also add more specific options to the crowdsourcing features.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-directions\">google-directions</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/everyblock\">everyblock</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">finra</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Budgetizer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budgetizer \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/984/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budgetizer \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/991/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budgetizer \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/992/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budgetizer \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/998/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budgetizer \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/999/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Looking at a bank statement doesn't provide an easy way to see how your money is being spent. Yes, it shows what you purchased and how much it cost, but each item is listed chronologically. It would be usefull if you could group these items by some category when you are trying to determine how to save money.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows anyone to log in with their credit cards and bank accounts (those supported by Plaid) and get a detailed look into where their money comes from and how they've been spending it for the past few months.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Budgetizer is a Python web application built on the Flask microframework which interacts with a MongoDB database and the Plaid API to make budgeting amazing. The Plaid API allows us to pull data from different bank accounts, present it in an easier-to-read format, and aggregate it with categories.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>In order to generate an accurate budget for the future, it's important to differentiate between one-off payments (movie tickets, a night on the town, etc.) and recurring payments (mortgage, insurance, etc.). While these are fairly easy for a human to detect based on patterns and the transaction descriptions, pattern recognition can be pretty difficult on a computer.</p>\n<p>We also decided mid-way through that we needed to save our information to a local database, so we decided to spin up a MongoDB server. While this can be done pretty quickly in a Linux environment, getting MongoDB set up on Windows is a tricky balance of pleasing the Mongo gods and reading old or outdated documentation.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The UI is simple, easy to use and looks great. We used a template called <a href=\"https://bootswatch.com/flatly/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flatly</a>, provided by Bootswatch, which is a bootstrap-based theme. It paired well with the strengths of the group and the data is handled beautifully.</p>\n<p>We were able to get MongoDB, a great NoSQL database, to function as expected on our development systems. We have used it as a team before on Ubuntu and it was easy to setup there. That said, we had not had the chance to develop with MongoDB on Windows. It was a bit of a bear to get it configured correctly, but we were happy to be able to use this technology to store our transaction data!</p>\n<p>Sorting out transactions by account to help narrow down results. Plaid's API is extremely well documented, and we realized early on that each transaction is tied to their respective accounts. Since users might want to tie a number of different cards and accounts, it felt like a no-brainer giving them the option to exclude some accounts. The implementation of this is clean and gives a lot more control to the user.</p>\n<p>The category graph on the transaction history. We've used many charting libraries in the past, and we've noticed not all of them are very responsive or accessible. This was our first time using Chartist, and it was a great experience! We were able to hook into the graphs to give an even deeper user experience by letting users have tooltips on mouseover and sorting on clicks.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Plaid's API is amazing. They've really gone all out with putting plenty of great documentation and support out there. We looked into it a bit before the hacking started and it's what really sold us on doing something with it.</p>\n<p>MongoDB has a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to query the collections for the information you need, and then group, combine, and alter it to meet your needs. In our case, this was used for generating the list of transactions to look at as well as generating the expected output for the charts with all of the necessary information.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Budgetizer</h2>\n<p>Budgetizer is designed to be a web service. Although we opted to host it locally for our demos, the next big step would be to get it set up and hosted online.</p>\n<p>Some other future ideas for useful feature include some of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integration with a stock API: This would allow a user to consider liquidating shares to help them pay for large budget items.</li>\n<li>Bonds: The user could manually enter bonds and their maturity dates to allow the system to better estimate future account balances.</li>\n<li>Location and Fraud Services: By using location data from Plaid, we could monitor transactions for the user. This would be further compounded by MongoDB's awesome geolocation tools.</li>\n<li>Deeper Analytics: This iteration of Budgetizer is just scratching the surface of what is possible with the data we can use from Plaid and the integrations with other services we can tie the website into.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chartist</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/plaid\">plaid</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I was in charge of setting up the MongoDB database that was used for storing all of the transactions from Plaid's API.

In current technology, a sequence of these 3x2 grids allows words and longer passages to be read by moving one\u2019s fingers over these bumps. Specifically, actuators raise or lower these bumps to create characters, hence requiring users to move their hand across a platform each time they want to read something. Users also need separate keyboards and mechanisms for input and output.</p>\n<h2>Solutions</h2>\n<p>Instead, FifthSense takes the approach of presenting these characters through a single 3x2 keyboard grid and reuniting input and output. Placing six fingers on the grid of vibrating motors, users would simply hold the device and feel the pattern for a given letter. To support writing in braille, FifthSense combined these output devices with input buttons, allowing a user to simply to press the pattern for a given letter back into the device- without moving their hands. This combined input-and-output approach allows users to move around while using the device and lowers the risk of fumbling around and dropping the device.</p>\n<p>FifthSense also sidesteps the downsides of audio-based solutions (e.g., a loss of privacy, background noise issues, the limitations of current speech recognition technology). The rest of FifthSense was designed to make our device braille portable and easy to use while on the go. Featuring a custom-designed 3D-printed case, FifthSense was designed to be durable and ergonomic. The electronics are managed by an Arduino; the device communicates with a synchronized smartphone using Bluetooth. We built FifthSense with an Android-based personal assistant: ask it a question and you will feel the response! Our custom Android app features calls to an API enabling a responsive Q&amp;A system. Since the device requires both hands to operate, it also features a distance sensor to replace the need for a walking stick.</p>\n<h2>Down the road</h2>\n<p>In the future, we hope to extend the abilities of FifthSense both by supporting additional smartphone features (using the onboard IMU and GPS to provide safety features, fully integrating web browsing) while also making the physical device more efficient and easy to use.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">internet-of-things</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/edhyah/BrailleWare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/edhyah/BrailleWare\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Soccer | 21", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Soccer | 21 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/135/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2><strong>What is Soccer | 21?</strong></h2>\n<p>Soccer | 21 is an exciting, fast-paced soccer multiplayer game allowing up to (you guessed it) <strong>21 different players</strong>  in an online, hectic, and outrageously fun freestyle game all at the same time.</p>\n<h2>What makes Soccer | 21 Special?</h2>\n<p>Soccer | 21 runs on your computer, while all the users connect <strong>with their phones online!</strong> No apps are required, just internet access and a computer running the program!

Tutoring is often times more difficult to set up and organize than intended. From setting a proper date to meeting at a certain location, along with the various logistics of planning a tutoring session, the process is simply (or maybe not so simply) too complicated. So we created HelpfulHands. This is an online tool that can connect tutors with tutees via a point-based system. Now, people can tutor others in the fields they think they're most proficient in, while receiving help in the subjects they find hard to grasp. With HelpfulHands, it is now possible to receive tutoring at any time of the day and from anywhere in the world.</em></p>\n<h2>How does HelpfulHands work?</h2>\n<p><em>HelpfulHands is a web-based application that allows users to search for mentors in whatever subject they desire, where the app then connects the tutor and student via live chat (powered by WebRTC and Twilio Video). Additionally, to accompany their tutoring session, the app features a \"collaborative drawing pad\" in the same window! That way, both student and teacher can communicate easily with one another and both learn and teach effectively.</em></p>\n<h2>That's great! But <strong>how</strong> does that work?</h2>\n<p><em>This was built on the MEAN stack (but without Angular, substituted for Jade). That means that it runs on a node.js server with MongoDB as its database. It then uses WebRTC (supplied by Twilio Video, which is currently in a beta-phase) to connect tutors and students in a real-time video chat. Each chat room has a max of two users, and we can track which user enters which room using Socket.io, which allows for real-time and live-updating applications. We used Socket.io to build the collaborative drawing pad so that any changes to the view in a chat room are propagated between the mentor and mentee.</em></p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into... Oh no!</h2>\n<p><em>If anyone can go through a hackathon without hitting a bug, then we commend them. We first ran into issues with Facebook's OAuth because we were redirecting to a page (but only some of the time, which was the mistake). Thus, we would get \"HTTP 302 Redirects\" for the homepage with no indicator as to why that was occurring. Then, setting up WebRTC, we almost gave up. We had no idea how to couple the live-stream chat system with Socket.io to create multiple chat rooms. Eventually, we got something to work. I think we're in the phase of \"My code works and I don't know why.\" Finally, we had to get the collaborative drawing pad to work and that was a pain because we had to create everything ourselves. There wasn't any public API we could use for that interface.</em></p>\n<h2>HelpfulHands' greatest accomplishments</h2>\n<p><em>Hi, my name is Donna Yu. I wrote this blurb on HelpfulHands and I helped build the web app! This was my first hackathon and it was more intense than I had imagined. I wanted to build an app that I thought could really benefit my community, as well as change the face of education. And I thought to myself, \"I wish tutoring was easier,\" since I like to do community service work by tutoring underprivileged kids in my neighborhood. So it was my idea to create HelpfulHands. This has been an unforgettable hackathon and I really want to continue working on this app after this hackathon, to see it grow and possibly be used by other communities as I push for mine to adopt the technology. It's also humbling to be around all of these amazing coders, and to still be a high-schooler.</em></p>\n<h2>What's next for Helpful Hands</h2>\n<p><em>In the future, we hope to connect with community service tutoring organizations for underprivileged students and have them match up their students with mentors on Helpful Hands.

We want to train people to form helpful habits which will improve their daily lives and health.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We have a sensor that a user can stick on anything with companion Android and iOS applications. When the sensor moves, the mobile app timer is reset (Congrats, you remembered to do something and are on your way to forming a habit!). If the sensor doesn't move after a certain period of time and the timers hit zero, the iOS and Android Apps send push notifications to the user telling them to do the required activity (and thus forming a habit).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>After the user inputs the time frame desired for habituation, they can put a Particle core (little tiny hardware gizmo) that connects to an Adafruit 9 DOF imu motion sensor onto anything they like. When the imu motion sensor is moved, the photon sends roll, pitch and heading information via http request to our server and then to our native iOS and Android apps. Both the iOS and Android apps process the information and if the imu has moved a certain amount in 3d space we send push notifications. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>-How the heck do we arrange these wires?\n-Running background activities in iOS and Android. \n-Building two mobile apps simultaneously while doing hardware and configuring a server.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We have never used hardware before and decided to just jump into it.

Eventually we want to use an Arduino Lilypad. We feel this product could have great impact in both the medical community (for remembering to take medication) and just recreationally.

Google translator nowadays has a great feature that can translate everything through the camera. As a user, you do not have to type everything into the mobile in order to get a translation. All you need to do is use your camera and swipe the area you want to be translated. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our InstaNote used a similar strategy but focus more on the note tag side. People nowadays rely more and more on the electronic notes. But many would feel inefficient and waste of time if you have to type everything you have seen actually into your mobile especially when you have a rather smaller screen. Thus we offer people a solution that you do not have to record everything with typing. Instead of that, with a mobile camera and a few swipes, you have all you want to remember stored inside your cell phone. It actually make people's life much easier. Besides, we added many advanced features such as share and tag in order to make the not more social. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The whole App is build on Android SDK, the language we used to accomplish the idea is mainly Java and XML. We have our front end layout design and icon. We also have image processing algorithm with which we can convert the image information into text form. Besides, we have back end database to support the application storage system.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This is almost the fist time for all the team members to actually build a android App, everything of the project was new and great challenge for us. The distortion and noise caused by the environment affected the result of image process severely. We also have some problem to adjust the database in order to make sure every updates for the note is consistent.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We have completed most features of our design.

Many \"hack\" projects exist to try to revive and breathe new life into them, but they are often prey to poor hardware. Its also very expensive to buy different transmitter \"modules\" to use for different aircraft, also, very few TXs support more than one or two telemetry protocols from said radios. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Due TX aims to provide an open source firmware, backed by some seriously beefy (but cheap and off the shelf) hardware that will hopefully create a hacking platform for firmware modders as well as eventually provide a virtually \"universal\" (with all major 2.4Ghz RC radios) Transmitter experience.. Its currently a fully working RC transmitter with planned use of Transistor based power management, wireless \"buddy boxing\" control schemes, and a whole lot more planned features.  (Please see final list of finished and planned features at the end of this description)</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The project revolves around an Arduino Due Micro-controller, and uses RC grade gimbal controls, as well as a miniature OLED screen for the menu interface. The current module also has support for FPV video, so far using an external VRX (video receiver). </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I ran into a lot of challenges, form generating the PPM Signal on non-AVR architecture, to creating the menu interface (where I sank the most time and effort most likely). Overall there was a lot of work but I feel like it has also been very rewarding. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I think that overall this is turning out well. I'm especially proud that after a ton of work the menu interface and screens look as nice as they do.  (Please see final list of finished and planned features at the end of this description)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned the PLA is annoying to print with, ARM Atmel boards are crazy fast compared to their AVR counterparts but are annoying/impossible to use without logic level shifters. Messing with the way Arduino does Timer Interrupts leads to a world of pain when you need to do any other task than what you modified the timers for. Also finally learned to use and implement (mostly against my will ;), but project driven) Finite State Machines. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Due TX</h2>\n<p>I am currently very serious about this project, so in the following days I plan to actually create a proper PCB layout of all the parts needed, and actually get a \"final\" version of the hardware. I think that I will be able to get a dev-kit for the platform within the month (maybe a little more due to school time constraints). I am really excited to get this working. I wish I had a couple more days to work on it here :D (Please see final list of finished and planned features at the end of this description)</p>\n<p><strong>Achieved:</strong>\nArduino Due Pulse Position Modulation Generation - timing matched to the Turnigy 9X\nBoth \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cinverted\u201d PPM is software selectable without performance degradation of any kind. \ni2c Display initial screen\nSupport for most 128x64 and larger i2c based displays (compile-time selectable) in both hardware-pin and bit-banged options depending on application. \nLive throttle readout  in menu\nClean menu interface created \nMenu scrolling\nMenu check-boxes\nFront Panel Rev 1.0 Designed and 3D Printed \nAll buttons debounced\nPPM Up to 16 channels of actual data being sent confirmed to work\nGimbal value matched to standard RC required values\nModel deemed \u201cworking state\u201d and should be able to be hooked up to aircraft in current state\nMuch smaller form factor comparing to \u201cinferior\u201d feature set \u201cstandard\u201d size RC Transmitters, all this while managing to pack in a 3.7\u201d screen for FPV live-video-out  </p>\n<p><strong>Achieved\u2026. sort of:</strong>\nElectric Imp Live Weather - (Achieved temporarily, but link wasn\u2019t reliable enough.

Boxing is a very athletic sport and sparring helps two people connect with one another but the physical pain is a deterrent to many. That's why we started Project Apollo Creed, named after a famous Rocky opponent, to create a form of boxing that doesn't require contact.</p>\n<p><strong>The Technology</strong>\nThe first thing we thought about was how to efficiently mimic a boxer's moves with hardware and we realized that the Myo comes with an on board gyroscope, as well as accelerometer. We wanted to use four myo's, two each for two people, but we found that you can't connect more than three myo's to one computer, which is what led us to our next tech decision, using Node. Node.js is an extremely powerful server language that helps us connect two laptops and Node also has great libraries to interface with the myo's sensors. So we set up a client side node program to be used by any user while we set up a server side to which the users will connect to. As for health, we also used calculations to estimate how many calories a person burns using our product, which will be explained in the next section.</p>\n<p><strong>Health</strong>\nBoxing is a very movement intensive sport so capturing the calories burned was tough so we estimated using common knowledge. When punching with the myo, we calculate the damage dealt using acceleration of the punch so we could understand the kinetic energy spent in one punch, (v^2*m)/2. The v is velocity which we get from the myo, the m is the mass which ask from our user. Using this information, we get the amount of energy expended in joules which we convert into calories but now there is just one missing factor in our equation, the human factor. We needed a benchmark to compare our results with so we used the fact that one push-up is worth one calorie to estimate that a really strong man could do 50 push-ups a minute, therefore he could burn 50 calories in one minute. Since one punch is only moving about one-third of our body's mass, we estimate that a really strong person could lose 15 calories in one minute of boxing. In our tests, the highest score achieved by a high school student was 8000 in our damage scale so we assumed a well built man could get about 15,000. Using these numbers we ended up with an equation that just had one last variable, the human efficiency loss. After calculating for that, we tested my weight against this model and I could theoretically burn 7 calories. There is a rule of thumb in many healthy living site that in a boxing workout, you would lose 2.72 calories per pound per hour of work.With my weight and spending one minute of work, that rule of thumb theoretically yields me burning 7.25 calories, only .25 away from our calculation meaning our efficiency factor is plausible. THAT is how we figured out how many calories are lost using just myo's and common knowledge.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Health algorithm, node expert", "Backend, frontend, javascript god", ""]], ["Ktree", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ktree \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/604/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ktree \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/732/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Ktree</h1>\n<p>The rise of MOOCs and online learning resources has started a revolution in learning.

The number of children and pets each year that become seriously ill, in some cases succumbing to such long term illnesses as blindness, after contracting hyperthermia in this situation is exponentially higher.This is because the interior of a car left in 80-degree heat with the windows rolled up can reach 120 degrees in less than an hour, causing for small kids to succumb to heatstroke when the body's internal temperature reaches just 104 degrees. As pet owners and older siblings, our team felt it was our obligation to help make a hack that would help save our loved one's lives.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This hack uses an arduino to read sensor outputs from both a force and thermal sensor. The driver turns on the thermal sensor through a push button addition to the driver's right arm rest. This would be ideal for pet or child caregivers who are walking away from their vehicles temporarily, and are unable to bring their dependent due to logistical complications. It would allow for them to get phone notifications, through an android app. which feeds them with automatic real time temperature alerts, prompting caregivers to rescue their endangered dependent. For a child, this systems becomes independent, without the need for a push button prompt. Instead, the Arduino and app become activated through the application of an appropriate weight applied to a force sensor, which is located in a special padded car seat cushion. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the arduino hard ware and software to initialize the system. We also utilized bluetooth, so that the readings could be transmitted from the arduino to the app. We utilized a javascript backed android app developer to develop our app. We also partly utilized 3D printing, alongside adapting our scrap card board, to compose our arduino housing. We also utilized a drink carrier to form a make shift car seat, a pennapps pillow to act as a seat cushioned, fashioned with a force sensor, and a sewed on sponsor shirt, to form the entire car seat system. The force sensor is connected to the arduino through a long connecting wire, which travels alongside the bottom of the backseat of the vehicle, to the middle of the cabin, where the arduino is housed. On the arduino, there is a push button to activate the pet mode of the temperature sensor, and a green LED which illuminates when the system is running, thus alerting the driver that the system is currently running. The signals from the temperature sensor are sent to the android application through the use of BlueFruit LESPI and coded UART communications via bluetooth. Android Studio was utilized to create the app. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The primary challenge was getting the temperature signals from the arduino to be converted to bluetooth, so that they could be read by the android app. This was due to both minor electrical design errors, and the difficulty in utilizing the BlueFruit LESPI program. However, we resolved it through mentor assistance. Also, we developed a number of CAD designs for 3D printing, most of which required longer than 2 hours to print, even in their most simplified forms. As such, we were unable to simplify to their required minimums before the 3D printing deadline, causing for our team to improvise creating the arduino housing system and car seat, using materials such as paper plates and cardboard cup carriers we found around the center, alongside a single 3D printed component. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Overcoming initial problems with bluetooth connections. The ability to create a system which has the potential to save human and animal lives. Completing a project in which no team member had a large amount of experience.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to best connect bluetooth to arduino. We learned how to utilize FreeCAD software and 3D print. We learned how to create an android app (something which only one member had minimal experience in) and make it become live. We learned how to integrate force and thermal sensors in arduino.

Based on this, using a proprietary algorithm, we calculate an initial credit limit and base interest rate. Credit limits and base interest rates are subject to be raised and lowered respectively as borrowers prove credibility and successfully repay loans on the platform. Borrowers create a profile that includes a photo and a bio.</p>\n<p>At sign up we gather the same information from lenders and allow them to start offering loans immediately. Lenders are informed that they bear the risk for all potential defaults and of what recourse they have in these cases (can report the borrower and give them a lower rating which affects their internal credit rating and potentially could even have them banned from the platform. </p>\n<p>The marketplace allows borrowers to set: the amount needed, their desired interest rate, and the tenor of the loan. Borrowers are then matched against lender\u2019s offerings and enabled to apply for a number of loans. We will provide a risk rating to the lender. Ultimately, the lender decides whether to accept or deny the loan application at which point they transfer the money to the borrower and the deal is closed.</p>\n<p>Once a loan agreement is reached, the borrower and lender have the ability to chat through the app (phone number exchanges and the like are discouraged) and even to renegotiate loan terms.</p>\n<p>Upon the repayment or termination of a loan the lender rates the borrower and it is the basis of this rating that future credit worthiness is calculated.</p>\n<p>Over time the algorithms that calculate initial credit worthiness and interest rates will become more robust as we learn about user behavior. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We conceived a system that connects borrowers and lenders using p2p technology.</p>\n<p>We built out the app for deployment on iOS using Swift.

We knew that entering the food in calorie apps always takes a really long time, so we wanted to make an easier way for people to keep track of their eating without having to manually enter everything.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app allows a user to take a picture of their food. The app then uses the clarifai API to identify the food and uses the USDA api to identify the food's calorie count and food group, adding them to overall, weekly, and daily counts. These counts are displayed in clear, readable graphs for the user to observe their progression in calorie and food group consumption over time. User information of food consumption is stored in a MongoDB database on a Linode server. The app displays the last few meals that a person had along with the calorie counts and times they were eaten. The app also uses the EveryBlock API to suggest nearby events based on the user's calorie consumption. A user that seems to have eaten too much food is referred to nearby events that may involve exercise and movement. A user that seems to have eaten too little food is referred to nearby food events.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the ionic framework that uses AngularJS, HTML5, and CSS to create a web-based iOS app. Our backend was written in Java and we had a MongoDB database on a Linode cloud server. The iOS front-end interacts with the Java backend which serves as a medium between the cloud server and the ionic-built frontend. After developing the backend and frontend to our satisfaction, we brought the two together, linking the frontend to the relevant parts of the backend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some trouble implementing the native camera app on iOS with the ionic framework with which we built the app. Also, none of us had experience with AngularJS and much of our time was spent getting used to AngularJS and the libraries that ionic implemented for the creation of our app. One major challenge was determining the best, most accurate way to identify the food in a picture and calculate the calories and food groups in the meal. We also spent some time getting accustomed with the various APIs that we chose to implement to make our app work.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were pleasantly surprised with how much we were able to accomplish on this app in the time that we had, considering that only one of our team has ever been to a hackathon before. The app contained all the features that we had envisioned, and we were even able to add more features than we had expected. The relative accuracy with which the app identifies foods is something we're also proud of.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned ionic, AngularJS, proper usage of git, implementation of several APIs, and using a cloud server. We also learned how to effectively split the work between frontend and backend so that we would complete all of the major tasks in a timely fashion and have enough time to combine the two parts to complete the product.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Picknic</h2>\n<p>We would like to directly implement the native camera app, develop the application directly in iOS rather than ionic, and implement city healthy eating comparisons. If people in cities are able to compare how their city is doing in average calorie consumption compared to other cities, they may be more compelled to watch their diets. Improving image recognition accuracy is always something we can improve on. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/everyblock\">everyblock</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/geocoder-ca\">geocoder.ca</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ouyangatang/food/tree/changes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ouyangatang/food/tree/changes\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front-end Javascript and the jQuery to communicate with the back-end and analyze the fetched data for our iOS application that was made using a framework called Ionic.

Many people have a hard time obtaining medical attention for common problems due to geographic barriers or complex routes that deter rather than help. Today's online health self help systems are designed by doctors who speak in a lingo not conducive to the general population. MeCheck is the quickest &amp; easiest solution to help laymen receive basic medical attention. </p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>MeCheck's simple search allows users to quickly and efficiently enter symptoms that are a result of colds or injuries. It then searches a database for supporting causes. After the user chooses the illness they have it takes them to a page that shows possible medications and treatments they can take. In addition, it shows a map of pharmacies where the medication listed can be picked up.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges we ran into was integrating Google Maps API. The API didn't fully support all the features present in the REAL google maps.

We have often needed to sift through many webpages just to get an idea of what lines to think on for the concepts. I decided to build this app to bring together three natural venues of thought we have to take as a foundation to research as well as because I thought it would be interesting to combine three huge APIs into a small application built for analyzing people in the world and what really matters to us!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This web application takes a search query from the user and passes it on to three APIs; Google Search, Twitter Search, and Bing News.

I learned so much in the past 36 hours. I feel like a pro at bootstrap and I really fell in love with the flexibility of it. I was really intimidated by APIs before but now it seems silly I was scared. Learning this much in such a short period of time truly blew my mind.</p>\n<h2>What's next for The BuzzWord</h2>\n<p>I would really like to eventually integrate the Facebook API, thus linking another new venue; one of opinions. Through top posts on Facebook we can tell how real people all around the world feel about issues that affect us all. By also adding a sentiment analysis layer in the future, we can gain an even further understanding about \"emotional traffic\" or the term used to describe when there is a certain anomaly in the emotional quotient and opinions of populations; thus providing for more productive opinion mining.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bing-news</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/net\">.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">waypoint.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jquery.easing.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jquery.stellar.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://thebuzzword.azurewebsites.net/search.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://thebuzzword.azurewebsites.net/search.aspx\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>thebuzzword.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Kartful", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kartful \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/230/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Kartful \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/232/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Karen has way too many tabs open when she's browsing the Internet for shopping items.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This extension becomes a comprehensive shopping cart by injecting Javascript into shopping sites and then performing data mining operations to provide an overview for users to compare prices and quality.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Tears, no sleep, caffeine.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Debugging is always a fun aspect of a programmer's life.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to have a somewhat decently facing product.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>That using third party APIs for product information can be a very painstaking experience if you are not careful with your XML, JSON, and PHP interactions.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Kartful</h2>\n<p>More sites?

Simply take a photo of your groceries, and we'll update your in-app inventory.</p>\n<p><strong>Connect</strong></p>\n<p>Have you ever needed to borrow just that one extra ingredient? With Facebook integration, FeedMe makes it easier for friends share much needed ingredients.</p>\n<h2>How We Do It</h2>\n<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong></p>\n<p>Determining the groceries that you have from a single image requires a fair amount of machine learning. We initially take the image and segment it into separate clusters that each have approximately one food item. We then use a combination of a deep neural network and a series of support vector machines that generate the list of groceries found in your image. To get our training data for these algorithms, we just use the ingredient name and populate our training set using Google Images! During the classification step, we also use an OCR algorithm to extract any text we might find on the items' packaging and use that to easily determine the food item in question. To train the algorithms we used four g2.8xlarge (Graphics card based) AWS servers.</p>\n<p><strong>Our Own API</strong></p>\n<p>Although bringing home and organizing food may be a near universal occurrence, the amount of APIs for dealing with groceries is sadly lacking. In order to search for relevant recipes, we scraped data from SuperCook.com using PhantomJS and interfaced this with PHP to create our own RESTful API, hosted on AWS. This allowed us to query for things ranging from what ingredient we need to make marinated mushrooms (probably mushrooms), to how we can effectively share our groceries with our friends. Furthermore, we used AWS to support a LAMP and Node.js server to deal with queries to MySQL and our ML algorithm.</p>\n<p><strong>iOS Development</strong></p>\n<p>To top it all off, we integrated everything into the FeedMe iOS app. Using Swift, we pieced together a relatively complex User Experience that could be delivered to a wide range of consumers on Apple devices.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">caffe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">libsvm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phantomjs\">phantomjs</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/carolinehermans/feed-me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/carolinehermans/feed-me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/carolinehermans/feed-me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/carolinehermans/feed-me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Ambit", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ambit \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/239/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ambit \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/327/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ambit \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/333/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ambit \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/386/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ambit \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/469/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired to make Ambit on the train here, as a funny hack. Ambit is a combination of Yik Yak and Omegle, which are two popular forms of messaging. Yik Yak with the feature of talking to people in your area, Omegle with talking to strangers, and SnapChat with deleting messages after a certain amount of messages.</p>\n<p>We wanted to build a cross-platform that Apple, Android, and Web users are able to use. We developed an IOS and Android App as long as Web Application for Ambit. Using native languages - Swift, Java, and HTML/CSS/JS - we were able to create a cross-platform application.</p>\n<p>Throughout the hackathon, we ran into a lot of challenges. None of our team had experience with Swift and Angular.JS, so learning these languages was a challenge that we overcame. We also had to write a database for the first time. along with getting railed by debugging with a variety of errors. </p>\n<p>We are proud of all the work that we did over the past few days, that came out to a better project that all of us ever imagined. </p>\n<p>The Web Application is live, and we hope to publish the IOS and Android apps in the coming weeks.

While the freedom is invigorating, it can become difficult to distinguish between necessity and luxury. Our team originally thought of an application that would help keep students on track with their spending goals. The additional responsibility of living with others also involves splitting groceries, rent, and transportation costs, which adds to the complexity of managing our finances. After finding Capital One's API, we decided to create a hack that could help categorize personal spending along with group spending. With Nessie, we can seamlessly transfer money between accounts according to an algorithm that evenly portions out group spending.</p>\n<p>First, users will create categories and target budgets to organize their spending. After each transaction, users will be prompted to categorize their purchase. The home screen of the app features an interactive pie chart that helps users realize their spending patterns. A running total of the user's spending is also displayed, along with the time remaining until the app's next cycle.</p>\n<p>To ease the tensions of communal spending, we give users the option to add contributors to certain categories. This forum for group spending allows roommates and colleagues to view one another's spending on shared items to encourage fairness. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nessie</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["BookTrade", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BookTrade \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/291/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BookTrade \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/292/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BookTrade \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/293/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BookTrade \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/294/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BookTrade \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/295/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BookTrade \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/296/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>BookTrade</h1>\n<p>Buy your books for less!</p>\n<p>This app is like uber or airbnb, but for textbooks.

Unfortunately, it is still very difficult today for patients to monitor how severe their condition is at home. Usually, the only way patients are able to gather any quantitative data on their sleeping habits is by going in to a hospital or research facility, being hooked up to expensive, uncomfortable sensors, and having their sleeping monitored by doctors. With Sleep Easy, we believe we can solve that problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sleep Easy is an android application that uses two pieces of technology to collect meaningful data: a smartphone with audio recording capabilities, and a Myo armband. After downloading the app, users simply open the app and click \"initialize\" to start recording data. Audio is recorded and analyzed to track trends in snoring and breathing, and the Myo armband is worn on the user's ankle to track movement and sleeping positions. After the data is analyzed and processed, you can visit sleapeasy.cloudapp.net to see a visualization of your night's sleep. The main graph on the home screen displays 3 major variables against time spent asleep: intensity of breathing (loudness of snoring), length of gaps between breaths, and sleeping position. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Sleep Easy</h2>\n<p>In the future, we would like to continue to refine our algorithms to output the cleanest, most precise data possible with our given set of hardware (smartphone and Myo armband). Additionally, we would like to expand the analyses we conduct to provide additional ways to visualize the data in clear and meaningful ways. Because this technology makes it easier and much more affordable for sleep apnea patients to understand their sleeping habits, we would like to finish off the product by providing user authentication / accounts, and the ability to store an endless amount of data on your account. We believe that simply collecting and analyzing data in a meaningful way can make a huge difference on sleep apnea patients worldwide, and will hopefully provide insights into treatments and medications that help improve the symptoms and overall life of the patient.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">virtual-machine</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://sleapeasy.cloudapp.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sleapeasy.cloudapp.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sleapeasy.cloudapp.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Remote", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Remote \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/312/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Remote \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/313/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Remote \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/314/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Remote \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/315/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Remote \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/316/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Since I have been at this Hackathon I have since people limited by the podium their laptop is placed upon. Even though they want to interact with the audience, they are drawn back by the fact that they need to control their slides. This has been a recurring thought in my head. With the growth of cloud computing and Internet of Things, isn't it possible to remotely control my presentations without been in-front of my laptop or have a wireless presenter or power point remote that only work for some specific device. Taking clue from how Spotify turned my phone into a remote control where I can control the music playing on my phone, I choose to convince myself at this Hackathon that it was possible to build one. My goal, build an MVP that shows that it works and that companies like Google and Microsoft which Google Presentation and Power Point respectively can take it a step further.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>My hack, takes a device (I used my iPod) and through cloud computing and web sockets make it possible for me to change the slides on my browser while mentioning a consistent, clear and easy to use look and fill on the device. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I the operating system I used was the Apple IOS 8.4 using the simulator for most of the testing. I was able to make socket communication with my \"Presentation Slide\" on the web through the Socket.io client for Swift. I simulated my slide by creating a simple HTML + CSS + Javascript + Socket.io page that allowed me to view images. The images where uploaded and stored on my server. My simulated presentation slide runs on a Virtual Machine (Ubuntu) on Microsoft Azure. I used Mongodb as my NoSql for my CRUD (well create and read) operations with respect to the storing of the slides and the receiving of the slides by both the device and the browser. My server was Node.js with Express + Socket.io. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge was how to approach the problem. I didn't have control over Power Point nor Google Docs nor was there any api that made it possible to play around such idea. I googled ways of embedding a power point into the browser but that didn't give me the flexibility I wanted. I had no other choice than to resort to using images. Power Point allows you to save your presentation as a GIF. I didn't have not time to try this option out.</p>\n<p>The second challenge was how to make communication close to real-time or instanenous as well as how would the application be designed to be easy to use. Finding that Socket.io was had a client for IOS was a huge relief as it had solved part of the problem. I still had to learn how to use it and how to make communication consistent. My though process of the design of the app and the presentation on the web was to bring together how music players are designed and how chatting works. This was how I implemented my hack.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>That I was able to complete the goal that I set out. Which is to build an MVP that its actually possible.

The recipient of the dare must say 1 out of a certain number, demonstrating the likelihood that they will perform the task. A third party counts the other two people down from 3: i.e. 1,2,3. After the countdown, the challenger and the daree must say a number through 1 and the certain number (if they said 1-15, it would have to be a number between that). If both participants say the same number, then the daree must perform the task.\nOur Goal:\nOur application allows two friends to play Odds Are in a simple, user-friendly environment over an iPhone application, with the ability to video tape the daree performing the odds challenge he was tasked with. These ephemeral clips of proof will be available on your friends' Odds feed only for 24 hours and you urself can pursue other lost odd challenges where your friends' perform their dares. \nWith a sleek design and an optimized UI/UX we allow users to laugh with each other at the outcomes of this simple game.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coffeescript\">coffeescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Cipher Solitaire", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cipher Solitaire \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/357/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cipher Solitaire \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/385/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Science and Maths have become increasingly popular in the curriculums of lower grade levels, in an effort to excite future generations invent, discover, and change the world.

Especially in neighborhoods like Philly, getting children to get excited about going to school is a daunting challenge. We realized that we could get kids excited about going to school if they knew that they had something to look forward to at the end of the day. School Squad provides an easy platform for kids to commit to laid-back, fun activities after school that are organized by the numerous Penn students who enjoy volunteering with kids.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>School Squad lets students vote on an activity they'd like to participate in after school for the month, and then matches them with groups of other children with the same interests and volunteer mentors from Penn and other Philly universities.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our app is built using Node.js and the Express framework. The users, squads, and activities are all stored in a mongodb database that's connected to the app through the mongoose ODM. It's hosted on Bluemix.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Not enough time! And none of us had ever used Node before. Asynchronous programming is not easy to teach yourself...</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Figuring out how to run cron jobs that automate the process of assigning kids and mentors to their \"squad\" for the month. It works!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Learn by doing and don't get caught up in reading all the ins and outs about every technology you're using before jumping right into it. A lot of time was wasted reading full tutorials without writing any code. </p>\n<h2>What's next for School Squad</h2>\n<p>... full functionality. But really, it would be cool to see how far we could take it. There is definitely plenty of interest among Penn students who enjoy hanging out with kids in the nearby neighborhoods, but logistics would be more difficult getting the schools involved.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://schoolsquad.mybluemix.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://schoolsquad.mybluemix.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>schoolsquad.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["CheckPlease", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8I5ARpMBIw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CheckPlease \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/328/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CheckPlease \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/221/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CheckPlease \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/222/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CheckPlease \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/223/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CheckPlease \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/224/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CheckPlease \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/225/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CheckPlease \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/287/226/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Paying bills at restaurant is really inconvenient</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The restaurant may use it to create a bill.

Calorie trackers already fill the market, but all of them require the hard labor of manually searching for items or entering calories yourself. With Banana Scana, the dream began with a banana and ended with the ability to easily and efficiently see the calories of every item that you enter. It empowers the user by giving him or her the ability to diet smarter. In a country where obesity is higher than ever, the need for such an application has never been higher.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Banana Scana is an intelligent application that uses image recognition to label and find calorie information on food items. The user simply takes a photo of the food item he or she is about to eat, and he or she is then presented with a list of options representing what the food item is most likely to be. After selecting the desired automatically generated item, the user's calorie information is then stored in the cloud and in the iOS Health app for easy access. The user can then see all history of food items or access a customized diet recommendation based on the user's personal information. Users can watch the \"Today\" screen as the day passes and watch how close they are to meeting their calorie intake goal.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Banana Scana works by taking an image from the user's iPhone and then storing it in Parse. From  Parse, a link to the image is then sent to Clarifai. Clarifai then responds with 20 tag possibilities of what the food item may be. </p>\n<p>For retrieving calorie information, we are using over 8,500 food nutritional fact entries created by the USDA. We parsed the data from an Excel sheet, using a Python script, into a JSON object. We then get the 20 tags retrieved from Clarifai and filter them by matching them with a filtering dictionary of food items. This eliminates search time by removing the need to search for all 20 tags in 8,500 items.</p>\n<p>Calorie information is then returned to the user, where he or she can select the number of servings. After confirming the food item servings, the calorie information is both updated in the user's Health app and in the cloud using Parse.</p>\n<p>Users can then access a \"Today\" view where they can see how close they are to their suggested goals. The Harris-Benedict BMR formula is used to give each user a customized calorie intake suggestion. Most of the information for calculating this is received from HealthKit. It is then displayed in a user-friendly circular progress view.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Updating objects on the server with Parse, adding user-friendly UI with the sidebar view, using HealthKit when little documentation is yet available, determining the best service for image recognition</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Team members gained much experience in Objective-C, with one of them going from knowing basics to becoming proficient. We are also very proud of our effective use of image processing and most importantly, the huge impact that an idea like this could have on the health of society.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Objective-C, Clarifai API, HealthKit API, Parse API</p>\n<h2>What's next for Banana Scana</h2>\n<p>Hopefully an App Store version in the future!

Us being a small school (&lt;170 total students), a lot of people IOU at the school lunches, which are student organized and not outsourced to a catering company. It becomes difficult sometimes for the council to get their money back. Another thing is that we conduct a lot of events, go to a lot of places, etc. If we set up one student system that could show all the events that the school is officially participating in, debt the student owes from lunches and other events, and have the student's full details to ensure that the student pays them back.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>My School Account first uses a registration to register each student, with their information of graduation, ID, etc. It uses a Linode web server. Then, MongoDB is connected to the Linode server, in order for easy data storage and capability of fast retrieval of the data. Then, the data can be used in a web interface to show the names of the students.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Used flask, Linode, Python, MongoDB, HTML/CSS. Used Linode to run web servers and a simple server to host the website itself. The servers are written in Python.

And it's not just for that. Any school can use it by simply setting up the server (Linode) and database (MongoDB) and edit the visuals of the site source code a little to add their own symbols. Also use a QR system similar to Snapchat to authorize the purchases and check in when buying a lunch or using an IOU via the mobile app. Can login via desktop to also notify of purchase.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Web developer for frontend, worked a little with Linode.", "", "", ""]], ["ComPlay", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ComPlay \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/214/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ComPlay \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/222/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We originally wanted to make an app which would allow gamers to form smaller, independent leagues to compete with their friends on their team. However, later on we were talking with other people and gauging their interest in the app and found that a match making system isn't all that easy to show off. In this dilemma we thought: well why not expand the app to all kinds of activities? From here we decided to make an app to connect locals in an area, who wouldn't normally interact at all, through competitive activities such as basketball or ultimate frisbee or a video game tournament. Anything that would allow them to come together and interact while doing something they would enjoy.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The web app we built allows people to place markers down on the map where they will be having events/gatherings. They then fill out a quick form about what it is they will be doing, how long until they leave, how experienced they would like the people to be, and who can make comments on the event. Others can then look at the map and see what kinds of events will be going on and how long they have to get there - and if they like what they see, they can join the event! All of this is anonymous, so people only see the organizer's username, not who the person is, so nobody has to feel bashful about putting their marker down.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first made many test scenarios to see how a normal person would go about using such an app. We then used much of that data to form the server-facing code and to generate the database design. We then used html/css and the google maps API to create a nice front-end to look at on the main page. We used AJAX to communicate with the web server to get new data from the database without having to refresh the webpage.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our first challenge was the loss of one of our teammates who had to leave on Saturday, so we all had to put in a little extra effort to cover up for his absence. Then we also had trouble with continuous deployments and custom domains with Microsoft Azure. Thanks to the wonderful help from the mentors at Microsoft we were able to expedite the process of fixing this large problem. JavaScript closures were also a big problem - which many google searches and a very helpful stackoverflow article helped to solve.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As this was all of our first hackathon, we were extremely happy with the amount of progress we made in such a short amount of time. In particular we were able to work with an API we had never used before and gained exposure into PHP and JavaScript.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that working as a team, having a proper budget design mentality, and pacing your work are all important skills to master to make a successful hackathon experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ComPlay</h2>\n<p>We are aiming to fully integrate chats, privacy features, and push notifications to enhance the user's experience on web and mobile phones. We also hope that with learning about these events going on nearby, more places around the world will develop closer bonds and tighter knit communities. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.complay.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.complay.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.complay.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end, essentially creating the design of the page,  contributed to integrate Google Maps API, and helped debugged the back end ", "", "", ""]], ["DeepStream", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QET3WAmphxY?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DeepStream \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/504/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DeepStream \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/505/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DeepStream \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/507/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The introduction of Google Cardboard allows for an incredibly affordable way for people to engage in Virtual Reality at home.

Many people talk about the wealth gap between the rich and the poor.  Although we beleive this is an important issue, we think an even more pertinent issue is the \"health gap\".  That is, the access to quality healthcare.  What better way to give the impoverished better healthcare then to give them the same healthcare of the rich.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project is unique in that is has two interfaces, one for doctors, and one for the patients in third world countries.  The part the doctors access is an iOS application. This iOS application contains a messaging interface in which doctors can view inquiries from a variety of patients, respond to them, and converse with patients.  </p>\n<p>The second interface is a SMS-based interface for the people in third world countries.  This interface allows users to communicate important information to their doctors, in their native language.  First, we take their input, detect their language, run it through a translation engine, and give the output to the doctor.  When the doctor replies in English, the input is run through a translation engine and appears in the sms users inbox, in their native tongue.  All this happens seamlessly allowing for smooth frictionless between doctors and patients.  </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Our PennApps project was built by first dividing our team members and time into two groups, back-end and front-end.  The backend team worked to build REST APIs to query Twilio, make users aware of new messages, login, and register new users.  The front-end team worked to make a seamless user experience for the doctors, building an interactive, beautiful user interface to make doctors want to help. The back-end utilizes Linode as a base environment.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Being a team comprising of 3 High School students and 1 College student, our team was pretty imbalanced in the beginning, but we got the ground running.\nThroughout our project we ran into many challenges.  The first, and greatest of these was asynchronous development.  The iOS team could only work when the back-end team finished an API function and the back-end team could only work when we knew what we were getting from the iOS team. This led to a lot of waiting and inefficiency. As the second night wore on, our planning got better and we were able to complete our project much faster than we would have been able to otherwise.</p>\n<p>Another issue we had was \"speaking\" different languages.  Our two iOS developers, Ryan and Darpan turned out to know two different things.  Darpan was a swift developer, where as Ryan was an objective-c developer.  They both improved at each others languages and were able to build a great application.</p>\n<p>We started using the Swift 2.0, but there were many changes made in the Xcode 7.6 beta version with regards to syntax, and so we ran into many problems. Towards the afternoon of the 2nd day, we decided to switch back to old-school objective-C. </p>\n<p>A similar issue occurred with our back-end team.  The back-end team had decided to make their application in flask.  There was just one problem: one of our backend developers, Alex had never used flask before.  Over the course of the two nights he learned and became extremely proficient in flask and was able to build a great application.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We are proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of what we accomplished at Pennapps.  Our project was very ambitious and we ran into a lot of errors.  Setting up a server, scaling our infrastructure for bigger demos, and  finishing something were among our greatest accomplishments.  With a team with such diverse background we gained new perspective from each others knowledge and learned a lot.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a ton this year at PennApps.  One of the most useful things we learned was the importance of pushing <em>something</em>.  Admittedly, certain parts of our user interface was lacking a great design element.  Others still used  <strong>terrible, terrible</strong> coding convention that would get even the newest developers scolded.  At the end of the day (or, in this case 2 days) it didn't matter.  We pushed a product that worked, and embodied our vision of being able to help those in need.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MedComm</h2>\n<p>Regardless of the outcome of PennApps MedComm will be pursued.  One of our team members has begun conversations with a few doctors to survey the interest among doctors and it is very high.  Over the next coming weeks we plan to rewrite, and improve the application.  We are also sending out emails to several organizations; including internet.org, about a partnership.  We have also spoken to someone from shot@life about distributing common access to a local number when they send vaccinations.

After capturing an image, Bluemix's Visual Recognition technology generates a set of labels that describe the image, which are read aloud by the Android Text-to-speech functionality. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>To ensure the app runs in an intuitive way for the visually-impaired, we worked directly with Android's camera API to simplify the picture-taking process, and this was challenging due to the complex behaviour of Android components. Another challenge we faced was in the integration of Text-to-speech, writing to external storage functionalities with the custom camera app we created.  </p>\n<p>Moreover, thinking in the shoes of a visually impaired person made us more aware of the problems they face, and how we should best design our app to be effectively used. For example, we implemented the initial screen so that the user can tap anywhere to capture an image.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>This is one of the first Android applications we have developed and we are proud that we can contribute to social change and were able to overcome most of our challenges. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SiteSee</h2>\n<p>We're looking to expand on SiteSee to create a suite of functionalities that help the blind/visually-impaired to navigate the world around them. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lucyyu24/SiteSee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lucyyu24/SiteSee\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked directly with Android's camera API to build the custom camera interface for the app. ", "", ""]], ["Proximity", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Using the EveryBlock API, we wanted to create an app that lets users know of recent criminal activity in their proximity.

Like many machine learning enthusiasts, I was enthralled by the psychedelic images produced. \nI felt a bad, however, that it received so little exposure \u2013 only people with technical knowledge in the field as well as access to high-end hardware were able to reimplement the algorithm (the researches did not release any source code).</p>\n<p>And so the idea for Artify was born: An Android photography application, but instead of ordinary filters such as \"sepia\" or \"gingham\", Artify has artistic masterpieces as filters.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>First the user takes a picture from the Android app and selects an artistic filter. These are then sent to my AWS web server, where I run my Theano reimplementation of the neural art algorithm on a massively parallel NVIDIA GPU.

We wanted to create an app that will young adults learn more in a new and exciting way.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app has two working features, namely Discover and Explore. With Discover you can read news articles that are summarized into 6 bullet points. Imagine being a teenager going to school; you're in a hurry and you get aboard the bus. You don't have time to read the whole 1000 word article so instead, you pull up our app and read the news in a concise manner. You can also filter on certain topics.\nWith Explore you find out more about the politicians. You can use our patented facial recognition technology to just scan an image of a politician and know everything about them. Whether it is their past education/work history, their ratings, votes or even funding sources, we got it. Think like you're a kid who is skimming through channels on a Friday night and you find debate happening on Vixen News. You really like the points this one guy is making and you think you might even someday vote for him someday buuuuuuuuuut you're a cool kid remember? You flip out your phone and snap a pic. Oh no, Sen. John Doe seems to be in favor a lot   but you're just complete on the opposite spectrum of it. Thank god Candidates was there to guide you otherwise you would've blamed Obama</p>\n<p>maybe.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We setup the backend in node.js and frontend in Polymer. Yep, Polymer. Even though it is a webapp, we made it native using Cordova. Welcome to 2015!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were a few bugs that would let me continue coding and the problem was so obscure yet simple that none of the people I asked could help, except this one person from Square. Internet was an issue too as I had to download and test a lot of bower components but sometimes it would just disconnect and I'd have to start the process over. We were going to include Elastic Search for candidates but ran into issues with database architecture.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Finally making a working project using the latest Polymer 1.0 instead of the antiquated 0.4 from waaaay back then (a year ago).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>If the problem you're trying to fix takes more than 5 minutes, it's something really simple and stupid to fix.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/polymer\">polymer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Check Me Up", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Check Me Up \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/135/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Most people do not know the check-ups they need and where they can have them. Ones who know the need search for check-ups by contacting hospitals themselves. Overall, many people skip necessary check-ups and miss early diagnosis chance. Additionally, process of getting an appointment from an hospital that has a suitable check-up program for the individual is elusive and tiresome. People need a service that can guide them through, by telling them what check-ups they need, where they can have them with regard to their insurance/healthcare plans and location, and leading to an appointment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The project integrates different parts of check-up process in an app to lead the patients. First, the app will present a list of check-ups based on acknowledged sources such as WHO and CDC, and users data, such as gender, age, and health info. User will select check-up programs, and the app will display a list of hospitals that have the selected check-ups, arranged according to user\u2019s preferences such as distance to hospital and costs depending on healthcare and insurance plans of the user covered by hospitals. The user will click on a single button to contact a selected hospital to make an appointment.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Microsoft Azure as a web app host, and MySql as a database. Then, we designed an app based on web, using web development languages such as PHP, CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Then, we generated mobile apps that can support iOS, Android, and Windows using Manifoldjs. We utilized features like Google Maps and calling intents. We also implemented an authentication system for secure storage and user information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Azure initially provided a depricated PHP version by default, which we had to troubleshoot excessively to figure out. Designing the web based app to suit the mobile versions was also a challenge. Most of us had to hack using entirely new environments and platforms such as Photoshop, Azure and mobile web designs, which required intense research and practice. We had to solve complicated algorithm designs to provide accurate and customized suggestions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We generated an app that can work on virtually everything: iOs, Windows, Android, Web... Also, we believe that we tackled a problem which has been obscure for everyone.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned teamwork (Hurray for git!), new languages, platformi and environments, time management and communication skills.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Check Me Up</h2>\n<p>The version we provide now has the fundamental features, yet has endless opportunity for the future. Additional features such as periodic check-up warnings and guidance to hospitals in case of minor injuries and health issues can be added. Upcoming partnerships with health organizations and social institutions will impact the masses. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

often than not, one's wellbeing is often only discussed in times of crisis. While reaching out during a critical time is ideal, being able to have a means of pre-crisis intervention could also alleviate the silent suffering that millions of adults and youth suffer each year. While there has been an increase in mental wellness focus in education, healthcare, the workplace, and in the home, there is still a gap between what is needed and what is offered. </p>\n<p>Sikavi helps to bridge that gap within the individual and with their closes contacts. </p>\n<p>For the individual, Sikavi is a means to put your life and how you respond emotionally into more appropriate context by providing visualized data based on psychologically sound instruments that have been used in practice and research to assess levels of depression, stress, anxiety, and work-place related burn out. While there is only so much that can be done in 48hrs, there is much hope for continually development and integration for the user in the future. </p>\n<p>For the peer group, Sikavi is a way to reach out for help through automated triggers based on the scoring of these instruments. This takes away any potential burden someone may feel that may sway them away from getting in touch with their support network. Automating the processes also ensures that there is less bias against getting help due to perceived or inability to assess one's own level of crisis. </p>\n<p>All in all, Sikavi is what the user makes it, but the core functionality is meant to be clean, quick, responsive, and intelligent without being sterile. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mood planner and tracking</li>\n<li>D3 for data visualization and a \"snapshot\" of trends based upon evidence-based psychological assessments (Depression Happiness Scale, DASS-21's subscale for stress, GAD-7 for Anxiety, and the Maslach Burnout Inventory) </li>\n<li>Emergency contacts specified by the user to be notified of extreme scores on instruments. </li>\n<li>Panic button and an algorithm which triggers notifications (SMS and email with GPS coordinates of the sender) to emergency contacts for a suspected crisis via Twillio</li>\n<li>Profile adjustment</li>\n<li>Ability to keep receive reminder emails and SMS notifications to remind the user to take the inventory based on how often they specify in their profile. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The backend is a MySQL server that houses the item level data, calculated scores, and user settings and preferences. </p>\n<p>Front end is a beautifully responsive design using Material Design and Bootstrap. The dashboard contains graphs built by D3.js for data visualization of calculated scores over time. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We didn't use any plugins or libraries other Material design for making a beautiful UI. We coded a survey platform from scratch and had lots of fun with MySQL (/sarcasm).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to develop so many features in so little time. Very clean and responsive design that is accessible on both desktop and mobile platforms. Being a two-person team with differing levels of experience</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Sleep is for the weak and the fortunate. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Sikavi</h2>\n<p>We would love to flesh the integration with other notification systems and create an admin/user hierarchy to have a provider interface to be able to easily access a user's data during appointments and give a better emotional context for health issues. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pa.johnldoner.com/register.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.pa.johnldoner.com/register.php\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.pa.johnldoner.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sikavi.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.sikavi.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.sikavi.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["PHP using MySQL database backend and integration of scoring algorithm to trigger warnings and notifications.", "Primarily front-end with Material Design, javascript, HTML5 and D3.js as well as the backend MySQL database structure.

We wanted to make something that would be right at home in any sci-fi flick.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hololight creates a 3d hologram that a user can interact with. It can do many things from playing videos, to letting a person explore a 3d model, to simply visualizing plots in R3. And it's all done hands free!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We had a screen reflect images off of pieces of plexiglass. Each pane was given a different FOV of whatever model was being used, giving it a nice 3d effect. The hand gestures were recorded by a leap motion, and the software was made using three.js.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest difficulties for me was the math and technical know how involved in getting the images to display such that they would reflect correctly when used. Eventually we found an open source project that had a similar idea and we were able to modify they're math to fit our dimensions. Due to a measurement area we have one less panel than is in classical holograms which made this project slightly more complicated when setting up the panels too.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am not usually a hardware hacker and have never used a 3d model in my life. This project was way out of my comfort zone and I didn't give up despite that.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned (or at least partly) three.js in one day! I learned the basics of leap motion too! I also learned the hard way to measure twice, cut once.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HoloLight.</h2>\n<p>We hope to continue to add more functionality to our project. Viewing 3d models is by far the hardest of the lot for us because have to modify the math based off of each models dimensions (we currently have the earth, a heart, and a brain for models). Adding a way to automatically perform the required maths to calibrate models. We also hope to get this implemented in some local classrooms. The project is cheap, and adds a fun level to elementary learning, and a much needed element to visualization of advanced mathematics. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">blood</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sweat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tears</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["StockOverflow", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StockOverflow \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/432/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We like data analytics.

Then it turned into an MLG style space-invaders game.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a simple space shooter showcasing cooperative/competitive gameplay in a public play setting.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We setup the framework for the level in Unity, incorporating EA Games' Pathfinder's API, allowing for remote control of the game over a webapp. We designed the graphics using Pixlr's online image editing tools, Autodesk Sketchbook and Gimp and created the webapp using Node.js to communicate and Sublime Text as an editor.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Neither of us had used Unity before and the interface along with C# (a new language for us as well) had proven worthy obstacles. Figuring out how scripts, models, and physics were run in Unity and incorporating a proprietary API provided several levels of complication over a single-platform project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud that we finished the level design, and have a beautiful looking webapp. I learned the C# syntax and successfully squashed a couple nasty bugs. One of which involved gravity still applying to objects even though Unity was in 2D mode, which was confounded by a movement script that was less-than-optimal.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that programming a project requires both teamwork and communication to run smoothly, and version control that is simple can be a big help. Divvying up the work is useful, but can get in the way if team members aren't working on their strengths or have different levels of involvement, with one more invested and one less-so. Our two-person team was well-directed, but with our limited numbers came limited programming man-hours. We shot for the moon and landed amongst the space just around it, a great feat with many lessons, but not quite a finished product. One last thing I learned was to ASK QUESTIONS. I can't say how many times I visited the EA Games table. I'm on a first-name basis with Scott, MJM, Tom and Tucker and hopefully have some networks to develop and people to greet at my next hackathon. I learned more about my limits and my reactions in a group. I'm great at pushing the project and directing workflow when there's a challenge, but I'm not so great at slowing down and tinkering with the possibilities. I'd probably do well with a minor to medium coding responsibility with a larger creative directing role.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Crowd Control</h2>\n<p>Finishing it, playing it with friends and further along the line developing it into an Ender's Game clone with a commander directing other space soldiers against waves of enemies who use machine learning to become more challenging.

We were inspired by this to create personalized newsfeed timelines of social and local issues. Our aim is to always keep people aware of the social issues around them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Imagine a simple web application and email service that keeps you updated about the social and local issues you care about. IssueMail is for people who care about social and local issues, but are too busy or don't have a unified platform to do so. People who sign up can choose which social and local issues they would like to follow and IssueMail gives them with a timeline of articles based on the issues they followed. With the sign up the users can also subscribe to periodic e-mail service which keeps the user up to date with the new articles as well as their timelines.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our application had different components - Data Fetching, Machine Learning and Ranking, Web Server and UI. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For fetching data, we use open apis for news articles, like guardian and alchemy</p></li>\n<li><p>For Machine Learning, we used sckit-learn python package, and Alchemy Sentiment to get sentiment of posted articles</p></li>\n<li><p>For Web Server, we run a Flask web app on IBM Bluemix Cloud Foundry container.</p></li>\n<li><p>The frontend is powered by AngularJS, backed by the Firebase authentication library.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Due to the API restrictions we were restricted to a relatively smaller data-set to test out machine learning algorithms. Also, due to other API restrictions we decided to use just one source of articles for demonstration.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Timeline of Articles - For each issue we show the timelines of the best articles. </p></li>\n<li><p>Personalization - User has the ability to personalize the feeds of timelines based on issues they follow.</p></li>\n<li><p>Sentimentality of Articles - IssueMail uses IBM Sentimentality analysis to classify articles as either positive, neutral or negative.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to succesffuly have a service which grabs relevant content, applies Machine Learning algorithms, and has a usable graphic interface. This looks a product ready to ship!</p>\n<h2>What we have learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Identifying the correct News API. It's essential to work with an API that provides comprehensive coverage over dates to have the data we would have loved to have</p></li>\n<li><p>There's no perfect clustering algorithm to deal with such vast vocabulary. We currently stuck to soft K-means, however, extensions to our algorithm like LDA can be integrated in future.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for IssueMail</h2>\n<p>For future we would like to expand the list of social or local issues or let the user decide them. We would also like to partner up with some NGO's which may be looking for people to volunteer and use the platform to get them connected.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/alchemyapi\">alchemyapi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://issuem.mybluemix.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://issuem.mybluemix.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>issuem.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.issuemail.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.issuemail.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.issuemail.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Curlie", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Curlie \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/881/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Curlie \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/885/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wondered \u2014 what if we could turn anything into an HTTP API?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Given some code, Curlie outputs a route from which you can execute your code using a single HTTP POST request.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We had to create isolated environments for multiple programming languages.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Spent a ton of time examining quite a few different approaches to running code in sandboxes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Smilin", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Smilin \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/033/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Smilin \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/089/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We're interested in the future of biometrics and passwords.

Verbal encouragement can only go so far. The individual will be motivated to exercise and get better if he/she can visualize a path towards being fully functional. Enter <strong>DRUID</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We envision <em>DRUID</em> as an immersive rehabilitation assistant for people who suffer from loss of motor function due to stroke or injury. By gamifying an otherwise boring and mundane regimen of exercises, <em>DRUID</em> enables patients to take charge of their own recovery, under the trained eyes of their physiotherapist.</p>\n<p><em>DRUID</em> offers a gamified VR experience in which a patient's limited motor skills, captured by a Myo band, are exaggerated to offer positive reinforcement in rehabilitation. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We quickly built a web portal on the MeteorJS framework to act as an input for the physiotherapist to define a physio routine for a given patient. The physiotherapists therapy plan is then stored in a MongoDB, hosted freely on <a href=\"https://druid.meteor.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://druid.meteor.com</a></p>\n<p>On the patient's end, we built an Android application paired with a Myo armband and a Unity3D game. We programmed the game to respond to a patient's exercise routine input through the Myo.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the primary challenges we faced that our team was inexperienced in VR, cardboard, Unity3D and even MeteorJS. Overcoming the learning curves quickly and hacking our way through was a big challenge.</li>\n<li>Myo has an inbuilt plugin for Unity on Mac/Windows &amp; iOS. We built it on Android, overcoming a very hazily documented area of Unity &lt;-&gt; Android &lt;-&gt; Myo.</li>\n<li>Integration of so many platforms together in 36hrs to build DRUID.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Overcoming steep learning curves quickly.</li>\n<li>Having an end-to-end working prototype of our vision.</li>\n<li>Helping each other out through unknowns.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Approaching the problem from multiple perspectives - Value addition for the user, Intuitive interfaces, technical considerations</li>\n<li>Working on multiple hardware/software platforms. Was challenging, but gave us the confidence to integrate cross-platform solutions so as to cater to a holistic user experience</li>\n<li>First time hackathon experience for half the team. Inspiring and exciting to see so many fellow hackers working on so many cool ideas</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Druid</h2>\n<p>We wanted to build a lot more into DRUID. Our vision for DRUID is for it to evolve into a fun, motivational and personalized medium for people to undergo paralytic rehabilitation treatment. We wholly acknowledge that no single type of motivation works for everyone, and we would like our game to be adaptive to the patient's recovery. An important focus would be to design games that let patients operate effectively in a gamified VR experience, that would empower them emotionally as well as physically in the rehab routine. The games intend to encompass and help the patient achieve a sense of accomplishing a day to day task involving his/her arm movements. The demo example correlates the patient's arm-pitching motion (about the elbow) with the task of lifting 3D objects. Output on the VR proportionate to the patient's physical effort gives him/her a better sense of satisfaction than plain physical therapy. Some of the future enhancements that we plan to build on top of our hack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Addition of a variety of games corresponding to real-world exercises that can be augmented with the help of a Myo armband</li>\n<li>A dashboard for the physio to track, and modify patients routine based on continuous input from patient's performance in routine</li>\n<li>VR assistance to train patient on new exercises and routine</li>\n<li>Adaptive difficulty to help patient progressively improve before next visit to the physio</li>\n<li>Future projection of recovery based on patient's performance in present and past routines</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sacnayak/druid.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sacnayak/druid.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["What Would Donald Say?", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jw7Bt-doVg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"What Would Donald Say? \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/009/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Donald.

We asked ourselves the question, what kind of features can we add to a car with just a modern smart phone? How can we make it more safe?</p>\n<h2>Heads Up Display (HUD)</h2>\n<p>It's easy to take your eyes off the road when driving. The latest and greatest cars (in the $40,000+ range) have an integrated heads up display to aid with this. Using a smartphone mount, velcro, location/accelerometer data, and mirrored text, we enabled the use of any smartphone as a windshield HUD, to help drivers keep their eyes on the road. Many of the features of FutureCar revolve around the HUD.</p>\n<h2>Automated Crash Reporting</h2>\n<p>The difference between the time of a crash and a bystander calling emergency services is approximately 5 minutes. Using accelerometer and speed data, FutureCar can infer that a crash has occurred by calculating impulse through both data sources (for multiple redundancy). Using Twilio, FutureCar can instantly send a crash notification alert to a friend (or in the future, authorities), with crash information, time, and location. This technology could potentially save many lives by decreasing the response time to a car accident.</p>\n<h2>Modern Media and Navigation</h2>\n<p>Most new cars now have modern media players and maps systems, while many old cars don't. FutureCar adds music and map systems onto the HUD using MapKit, the system media player, and mirrored/enlarged layouts.</p>\n<h2>Instantaneous Fuel Efficiency</h2>\n<p>By taking the derivative of speed and comparing that to a fuel efficiency curve, FutureCar calculates how much fuel you are using on a relative basis and plots it as a bar indicator on the HUD. Many new cars have this feature, but FutureCar allows any driver to get instantaneous response on how fuel efficiently they are driving, potentially saving expensive gasoline by allowing a driver to optimize.</p>\n<h2>Distracted Driving Prevention</h2>\n<p>Every year, 8000+ people die from car accidents directly related to cell phone distractions. Using our FutureCar system ensures that users won't be distracted by notifications and text messages until after the drive. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapkit\">mapkit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chanmatt/futurecar.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chanmatt/futurecar.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the android version of the app.", ""]], ["Turdlr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Turdlr</h1>\n<p>Penn Apps project</p>\n<p>An app developed to locate and rate your experiences at different locations and use the ratings of others at locations\nto determine whether or not you need to use them.</p>\n<p>We originally developed the app to track bathroom usage experience and being able to use it to find the bathroom that was right for you.</p>\n<p>After many hours we got the map and the location marker drop working and the database set up to store all of the marker drops.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dave-abelson/Turdlr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dave-abelson/Turdlr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I came up with the idea and worked on the front end development in swift, creating layout and design and some of the back end algorithms and features.", "I worked on the Meteor backend with a MongoDB database and integrated it with  Swift using the HTTP verbs GET/POST.

That\u2019s why we created a platform for spontaneous educational creative challenges.</p>\n<p>Our learners on mobile subscribe to a channel or class, which alerts them whenever a teacher or admin publishes a new prompt. A photography teacher asks students to take a picture that demonstrates the concept of the rule of thirds. A PE teacher prompts students to take a picture of their dinner to determine nutritional value in class. A computer science teacher may ask students to write pseudocode to solve an interesting algorithm. A history teacher could request students to take a picture of an object that is at least a century old. A chemistry teacher may ask students to take a picture of something in nature that contains certain elements. A graphic design teacher prompts students to sketch a logo design for a mock company.</p>\n<p>Students can view others\u2019 responses to prompts once they have submitted their response through the iOS app. This provides immediate insight into multiple responses to the same prompt, giving students a broader understanding of the subject matter. For grading and presentation purposes, teachers may view students\u2019 responses through a web application.</p>\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n<p>As students, we suffered from the inability to retain information we learned in class. Like many others, we crammed before tests and rarely engaged in subjects. The Learning Pyramid shows that retention increases 15-fold when students learn by practicing, doing and teaching others rather than learning in lectures. With Ivity, we have combined both of these participation-based teaching methods to create a fun learning experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/backbone-js\">backbone.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Some-EdTech-PennApps-Team\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Some-EdTech-PennApps-Team\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ivityapp.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ivityapp.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ivityapp.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Pennypool", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pennypool \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/678/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pennypool \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/679/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pennypool \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/680/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pennypool \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/681/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We want to build the most widely used financial platform, which enables people to save money in a disciplined manner and guarantees a good ROI, along with the flexibility to access huge amounts of cash when in need.</p>\n<h2>Opportunities</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>America Saves too little.\nMore than a quarter of Americans have no emergency savings.\n67% have less than six months of emergency savings.</p></li>\n<li><p>No Company, Product or Service in America addresses this issue efficiently.\nThis gives us a wide window to dominate and capture the market.</p></li>\n<li><p>Obtaining funds from a bank or any other service during an emergency is difficult.</p></li>\n<li><p>Hassles and time taken to get a loan.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Extreme programming</li>\n<li>Divided modules.

I thought in order for me to wear the shades to a party, I would need to have to add sensors, and maybe even produce a phone and smartwatch app to control the patterns on the shades. PennApps was the perfect place for me to research and develop what sensors and hardware I should use to proceed forward with my goal into making the ultimate party electronic wearable. </p>\n<p>With my pair of the RGB shades, Arduino, audio expansion boards, amplifier battery back and audio source (via standard 3.5 mm input or microphone), the walking rave is small and easily transportable system.</p>\n<p>I knew in order to create a proper synced display for audio, I needed to utilize the Arduino FFT libraries, many of which were confusing to use and timing consuming to implement. I tried the brute force method of tinkering with the library that supports the shades kit, and managed to find a way to utilize the analog inputs, and use properly scaled values via amplifiers, with an audio source and was able to get a nice pattern synced with audio. </p>\n<p>I did primarily work on the hardware from this project, but I still would have not been able to complete this project without the help of my teammates, who walked me through the programming process and assisting in the building and testing of The Walking Rave.</p>\n<p>This project refreshed my C programming knowledge and made me aware of the proper syntax again.</p>\n<p>I plan on possibly taking this project to MHacks and working on the Android Phone/Wear App for my smartphone and watch. In the process of developing these add-ons and capabilities for my RGB LED shades, I can set up the foundation for future developers and enthusiasts who currently own or plan on owning a pair of this one-of-a-kind wearable. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">analog</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pocket-operator</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["FoodLocker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKNH7JXH7pM?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodLocker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/837/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodLocker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/934/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodLocker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/935/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodLocker \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/936/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodLocker \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/361/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodLocker \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/370/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FoodLocker \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/376/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Sometimes controlling what you eat is hard.<br/>\nHow can you control how many calories you're intaking?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user places food in a box.

Current systems can monitor your pill intake frequency through indirect methods which can either provide incorrect information or information which is not up to date.</p>\n<h2>What is Pill Pal?</h2>\n<p>Pill Pal is a smart pill bottle connected to the cloud that will always remind you to take your medicine on time! It will also keep your healthcare professionals in touch by sending them alerts if you forget to take your medicine, or have stopped taking it without their consulting etc. This will allow them to help you, the patient by adjusting things necessary for the patient. Pill Pal provides you and you trusted healthcare provider with up-to-date information straight from your medicine cabinet.</p>\n<h2>How Pill Pal Was Built</h2>\n<p>We started with the ubiquitous pill bottle and attached an array of sensors and led indicators to a Spark Core micro-controller which updates your usage in the cloud. The Spark Core has wifi capabilities allowing us to connect it to the internet and not be tied down by local network. The partnering Pill Pal app was built on the Android platform using java that was a portal between the patient and their doctor setting up alert system and reminders.\nAs a bonus, any users which own a Pebble smartwatch can receive timely reminders when they've forgotten to take their medication.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Had to Overcome</h2>\n<p>Some of the challenges we ran into were communicating with the Spark Core hardware. Currently the proprietary Spark Core android api is broken and thus we had to implement as much functionality as we needed using the Spark Core rest api. Lastly, setting up a system where the various smart devices of patients and healthcare providers can synchronize and share data in real time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>Our team is proud of being able to overcome the challenges we faced during building Pill Pal. The \\accomplishment we're most proud of was making the alert system work in Pill Pal that alerts both the patients and the health professional in case medication mishap occurs. We were proud to not only finish the app on time, but with had just enough extra (not really, but we squeezed it in) time to add Pebble functionality to our system.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We learned better use of external Android API's as well as connecting hardware to the cloud directly through wifi and controlling it using a mobile app. \nWe learned how to use the Spark Microcontroller, and implement a rest client in android using the excellent retrofit library. \nWe learned a little too much information about each other.</p>\n<h2>The Future of Pill Pal</h2>\n<p>Our future goals for Pill Pal is to make it even better by adding new features that will find patient behaviors based on their medicational habits and keeping health professionals as well as health providers in touch with their patients.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pillpal.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pillpal.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pillpal.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jimmyklein4/Pill-Reminder\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jimmyklein4/Pill-Reminder\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jn23.me/hacks/pennapps-xii/PillPal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://jn23.me/hacks/pennapps-xii/PillPal/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>jn23.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend, and hardware interface.", "", "", "", ""]], ["TouchSave", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Max suffered a stroke when he was an infant. From that day forward if he's ever in a dangerous accident he will fail any and all field tests for brain trauma, even if the accident isn't the cause. because of this he has been advised to wear a medical alert band for his entire life. </p>\n<p>(Max) I stubbornly fall into the majority of individuals that should be wearing one and don't. Upon my acceptance to PennApps and discovering the theme was health, Zac and I spent a few days spitballing ideas for our hack until we stumbled upon the idea. To us it was perfect, it would directly impact our lives and bring open source safety into the world.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TouchSave stores any medical information the user might deem relevant to an EMT in the event that they are being rescued in case of an accident. This can include current medications, allergies, risks, and so much more. Through use of NFC stickers placed on the user's wallet, phone, or jewelry a paramedic can scan and view what the user has input in order to make safer judgement calls out in the field.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>TouchSave was built using Python on the Django CMS, and was tested using android devices for their easy to use NFC development side.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Having never been to a hack before, the main challenge we faced was inexperience. the entire mentality was new- \"creation for the sake of creation\" was just never a thought I'd entertained before this year. Breaking these mindsets was the greatest challenge of the weekend, and I'm so glad I did.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>For every member of the team this was their first Hack. As a collective we're pretty damn proud that TouchSave could go from idea to reality in a matter of hours. This experience has been amazing. We quite literally created a project from nothing in 2 days. That's something to be proud of to me.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>It's ok not to know what you're doing. It took us almost an entire day to figure out what stack we were using. The lesson from this is that inexperience isn't an excuse for not going out and doing something. We did it. That took guts and despite not having a pristine or beautiful project its a start. </p>\n<p>Most importantly I learned I'll be applying to a lot more hackathons in the near future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TouchSave</h2>\n<p>TouchSave will continue to be developed on as a project for our school's yearly project expo, Imagine RIT. It is our hope to see open source safety procedures become the norm one day.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nfc\">nfc</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mobile</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://45.79.135.182:5000/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://45.79.135.182:5000/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>45.79.135.182</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["SCORE", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SCORE \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/818/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SCORE \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/819/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the messy, uncoordinated Board of Education meetings that our school districts offers and sought out a technological solution to it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows each part of the educational community to give and receive specialized feedback to one another.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The website was mostly front-end web development with HTML/CSS, Javascript, and jQuery.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The team is comprised of 3 people, all who are all Java programmers.

Along with providing alerts in regards to any previous products the user has bought, we also suggest other related products consumers may be interested in.<br/>\nAll you have to to do is scan your desired product (either in a web browser or on your mobile phone) and a click later, you are purchasing your deodorant or paper towel! Keep in mind that the more you buy from our interface, the more the system will learn about your habits and provide text alerts and notifications in the future. We have an easy visual represntation system that allows users to view a calendar of previous scanned items as well as when you should be purchasing new items.</p>\n<p>We feel that this system can revolutionize how people shop. Instead of traveling to a grocery store every sunday night with a list of what you <i>think</i> you need, just use Shop-buddy! It will remind you to buy your low-stock items in your house <i>only</i> when you need them, and its a simple scan-and-click away from having that 2 day Amazon Prime shipping. It is quick, easy to use and has a clean interface for any demographic of customers!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><b>Linode</b>: Utilized an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual server to run our entire code base. The Apache web server (including our PHP, HTML5, Javascript, etc.) and associated APIs were built into the linux environment.\n<br/><b>.CO</b>: Registered our shop-buddy.co domain to point to the previously mentioned Linode server.\n<br/><b>Goldman-Sachs</b>: Our system is cloud based and therefore can run on any mobile or web enabled device! \n<br/><b>Twilio</b>: How do we notify our users that its time for them to submit their groceries for the week? We use Twilio of course! Twilio's services allow us to send SMS with embedded links to immediately click and pay for the products that users will be needing in the near future\n<br/><b>Venture for America</b>: We believe our system can truly change the way people shop and purchase goods. Why go out to the store every Sunday evening or have to worry about creating a grocery list? Our system is able to identify, based on user habits, what users need and when they need it before they even know it!\n<br/><b>Amazon Web Services</b>: Shop-buddy directy interfaces with Amazon's Web Services to display product information. After obtaining the UPC code from the product's barcode, we also utilize Amazon's Item Lookup and Item Search web features to find and display the correct product.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Shop-Buddy</h2>\n<p>The list of included features is only a small portion of what we originally imagined. With further development we can easily add:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One-Click Amazon Checkout</li>\n<li>Entire cart suggestions and purchases</li>\n<li>Desktop notifications</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, we would love to build up and include better machine learning algorithms to truly understand and learn what to display to our users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shop-buddy.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.shop-buddy.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.shop-buddy.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mray19027/PennApps2k15\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mray19027/PennApps2k15\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Meal Share", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FfW01PPPyPc?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meal Share \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/799/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meal Share \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/800/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Meal Share \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/801/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We looked at common struggles of young college students: having to spend university meal plans on a fixed schedule, and often having to get rid of perfectly edible food.

I suppose I thought of the idea after Google Cardboard; Virtual Reality is still one of those fields where someone needs hundreds of dollars to pursue and develop in the field, but Google Cardboard lets anyone make a quick add-on to their phone for a few dollars that helps them get almost the same experience. 3D printers still cost hundreds today; maybe, if someone can build it at home on their own with very few trips to a hardware store (essentially none for sufficiently involved hobbyists), the cost of the printer can be reduced to 20 or 30 dollars. Of course, the end product won't be any Makerbot, but it could be good enough to produce basic products and perhaps bootstrap's one's way to a better printer.</p>\n<p>The design's based on the Prusa i3 (loosely) from RepRap since it has a relatively simple design.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a really ratchet-looking 3d printer that's not very accurate--basically an attempt at a 3d printer thrown together with parts around PennApps and some things we brought along beforehand. In reality it's only 2d right now because a planned motor broke and we have no spares, but the printer's well-capable of 3d and can easily configured to do so should we have had a spare NXT motor.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>With some really shady parts--we took used cardboard boxes from sponsors and made them our base material. Hot glue was the element of choice for bonding together parts. Not sure if I should mention this, but special thanks to the sponsors that unknowingly gave us an XL shirt, which we ripped up to create our moving belts--sorry and thanks! Our project wouldn't be possible without your wonderfully stretchy shirt.</p>\n<p>A lack of string and packaging tape at PennApps forced us to use plain old wire and gobs more hot glue in replacements. Note to PennApps: we'd like if you could include these items in the future. Motors and associated things (e.g. H-bridges) would be nice too! </p>\n<p>Teammates brought along tools, electronics, and parts for other things, but only sparingly--we use a single microcontroller (the BASIC stamp) based on a PIC and an H-bridge, and the rest is jumper wires. We used NXT motors, but they're effectively very simple DC motors at heart and with a bit more electronics, plain old two-wire DC motors could probably be used. The BASIC stamp comes for around $50 retail, but if this kit were to be in production it would just ship with a single pre-programmed PIC, so the cost would come down quite a bit. No soldering was done; all things were put together on a breadboard. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The extruder mechanism in most 3d printers is complicated, and due to a lack of time we were unable to develop a \nsystem that could autonomously handle extrusion with the servos available to us. So we manually feed our extruder.</p>\n<p>During the development of a circuit that allowed the printer's motors to diverse direction, a weird set of issues and \"ghost voltages\" that popped up during the troubleshooting process. We were eventually given advice to switch to an H-bridge. </p>\n<p>One motor has become mysteriously clogged, preventing its movement, so we couldn't make it a 3d printer! It's instead only able to print in 2d (but if we had a replacement, easily scalable to 3d). For now, all our prints are single or double-layer.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Actually finishing this thing. Goddamn. I have a Prusa I recently ordered at home that came half-assembled, and I haven't been able to assemble it in 5 days; I'm shocked we were able to throw something together functional <em>from scratch</em> in 36 hours.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Yeah, aside from finishing the monster project, I'm glad we learned a lot about the interfacing of seemingly disparate technologies (e.g. BASIC stamp and NXT motors). We also became super resourceful (running all the way around PennApps several dozen times for parts) and have a greater understanding of 3d printing mechanics.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ratchet 3D</h2>\n<p>I'd really like to see an extension of this concept as a norm for 3d printing in the future. Perhaps a plan for the construction could be open-sourced; similar to Google cardboard, it's even possible that we will be able to make printable template overlays on top of the cardboard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">basic-stamp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nxt</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lego</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cardboard</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/abhir1212/pennapps\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/abhir1212/pennapps\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped to write most of the software along with another teammate - I made some contributions to hardware as well, but mostly repetitive tasks that did not require any real hardware knowledge.

In an effort to bring security and privacy to the common person, we created Meema, the painless, portable password protector.  </p>\n<p>(A note on the name: \"Meema\" comes from the Chinese phrase for password, which is \u5bc6\u7801, or roughly \"meema\".)</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Meema is designed to be a convenient and secure method for storing and filling passwords. It acts as a hardware password manager that can be used plug-and-play-style for accessing stored passwords and easily supplying them into password fields. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Implementation</strong>: In order to maintain security, all passwords are stored in two separate entities, through two separate stores. One piece will be stored in an online database, and the other will be stored offline in a hardware database. The online database will be accessed via a REST API, and the hardware database will be accessed using the Intel Edison through an ACM Serial (USB) connection. </p>\n<p><strong>Components</strong></p>\n<p><em>Webserver</em>: The webserver require authentication using a unique hardware identifier, a username, and a password.  Password fragments on the server are not encrypted and can be accessed through the REST API after proper authentication.</p>\n<p><em>Meema Key</em>: The Meema Key serves two main functions: a USB Mass Storage device and an ACM serial communications bridge. The mass storage device stores password fragments and decrypts them when properly authenticated. The serial connection is used for accessing data from the Meema Key as well as issuing commands to it. </p>\n<p><strong>Encryption Process</strong>: Once all data has been collected, Meema breaks the password into two separate fragments and stores one on the Meema Key and the other on the web server.  When inspected individually, both fragments are indistinguishable from cryptographic noise; only with both fragments is it possible to recreate the password.</p>\n<p><strong>Decryption Process</strong>: The decrypting application (either the native OSX app or the Chrome Extension) retrieves the stored password fragment from the Meema Key after proper authentication. The application then queries the webserver for its password fragment, in addition to any other non-sensitive data and metadata the server holds (such as username, email, or any other saved fields).  The application then combines these two fragments to recreate the original password.</p>\n<p><strong>User Facing Code</strong></p>\n<p><em>Chrome Extension</em>: The user can interact with Meema through a Chrome extension that will prompt login to the Meema Key with a username and password combination specific to the key. Once authenticated, the Meema Chrome Extension will scrape websites visited for login inputs and allow users to store their passwords as well as other input information.</p>\n<p><em>OSX Application</em>: The user can also interact with Meema through a native OSX app to store login information to native applications.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Meema</h2>\n<p><strong>Biometric Identification</strong>: Instead of assigning a password to their account, the user can use a biometric sensor (for example, a fingerprint scan) to encrypt their Meema Key.</p>\n<p><strong>Mobile Authentication</strong>: Instead of assigning a password to their account, the user can instead connect a mobile device to their account.  Authentication consists of sending the user's device a push notification (via the Chrome Notification API), which when activated unlocks the Meema Key.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">crx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angular-material</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.meema.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.meema.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.meema.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["GitMail", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GitMail \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/290/703/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>GitMail</h1>\n<p>Connect Gmail emails to GitHub repos.

We decided to create Plaidypus, a personalized AI bot that reflects the styles and quirks of each user it meets.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Plaidypus is a fun loving bot that can take on the linguistics style of you or your friends. Pulling from a corpus of a user's past Facebook messages, Plaidypus picks up on many of the subtleties in dialogue that together characterize how each one of speak. In our app, Plaidypus can either take on as you, or any of your Facebook friends who have been with Plaidypus.</p>\n<h2>What makes it different</h2>\n<p>Unlike traditional AI bots, Plaidypus does not just regurgitate random and largely irrelevant comments you made in the past. Rather, Plaidypus take the time to formulate a response, much like the way you do; Plaidypus considers different linguistic mannerisms for incorporating local slang, demonstrating knowledge of pop culture with gifs, and responding to articles you send.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For the backend natural language processing, we used a variety of toolkits such as NLTK for n-gram modeling &amp; POS tagging, Indicoio for sentiment analysis, and coreNLP for named entity recognition. We also adapted algorithms such as tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) and applied specific knowledge of linguistics (ie. grammar, fillers, contractions, formality, etc.) to customize Plaidypus to take on each person it speaks to. \nOn the frontend, our web app provides a clean interface for realtime interaction with Plaidypus, built on Django, react, grunt, browserify, es6, babel, and a number of other libraries. </p>\n<h2>Challenges &amp; Accomplishments</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lack of data</strong> : A challenge that came with our selection of Facebook messages for our base corpus was the limitation on quantity of data we could access. Since Plaidypus is built on the traits of individuals, we could not aggregate data from multiple users. As a result, we stepped away from a strictly objective data analysis approach; rather we chose to dive into different aspects of linguistics to build our own unique models for optimization.</li>\n<li><strong>Building an identity</strong> : Another challenge was determining what role we would want our AI bot to play, and the personality we would instill. Throughout development, we kept the 4 qualities of humor, intelligence, practicality, and human-ness in mind, so we think Plaidypus has what it takes to be the second best version of you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Plaidypus?</h2>\n<p>To grow and learn.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/grunt-js\">grunt.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">browserify</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">babel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">es6</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stanford-corenlp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indicoio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/giphy\">giphy</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/raoariel/PennApps-F15\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/raoariel/PennApps-F15\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Goblr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Goblr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/809/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A huge problem in today's society is Healthcare.One of the most practically solvable problems is of diet and obesity. Our team realized the enormous number of photos uploaded to the Internet every single day. Furthermore, we noticed that search engines and image recognition software have greatly improved over the years. Using these trends to our advantage, we decided to design an app that could solve the aforementioned healthcare problems without drastically changing the habits of many mobile platform consumers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Goblr is an Android app that lets users take pictures of food items and in turn will provide nutrition facts about that given item. Users will also be able to save the pictures they take of their food.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using an embedded camera fragment, we retrieved an image from that activity. Using this image, we had to upload it to the Internet using the Imgur API. After our POST request, we took the URL we received from the JSON after posting the picture. We took this URL, and put it through the MRISA API which was put up on a server. This API would then return a single JSON with the closest match of the search and give us some information such as the title and name of the picture/food. Then with the name, we put it through the DNB API which would find the food in their database and return another JSON of the nutrition facts of the food. Parsing the JSON, we display the information for the user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was our first hackathon and we didn't really know what to do. The lectures we attended kind of gave us an idea of existing problems along with the fact that big data could help us design technology that could ameliorate these problems. As prior experience, we designed a small app with some basic math functionality so that we would be somewhat familiar with Android Studio. When we thought of our idea, we found resources that would make it possible, but our biggest problem was implementing these APIs inside of our code and making sense of it. A member from another group was kind enough to help us make servers and implement these APIs in our code while telling us how it worked. Also, the mentors were very helpful and patient and also helped us with the Imgur API, the first API we had to implement.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The app looks very clean and professional. We were also able to successfully implement the functionality we have envisioned. As a team, we had a ton of fun and we are more than grateful to have been able to attend PennApps.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about APIs and using libraries to facilitate implementation. We were also able to get a better sense of what other hackers were working on and it made us more perceptive of the opportunities and possibilities available in the field of technology.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Goblr</h2>\n<p>Goblr's search engine is not perfect, but that is a positive improvable aspect of our app. It will allow us to take data from searches by many users and will let us build a database that makes future searches more factually accurate. Furthermore, companies will be interested in the big data our app has the potential to collect. We believe that Goblr is an app that can definitely be scaled in today's market.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mrisa</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/imgur\">imgur</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dnb</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Leap Funk", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Leap Funk \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/506/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Leap Funk \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/504/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Leap Funk \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/503/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Leap Funk \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/505/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Leap Funk \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/507/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>#LeapFunk</strong> is my first time working with the Leap Motion Controller and <a href=\"http://threejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Three.js</a>.

Control is fully gesture-based. Apart from basic controls, the roll of the hand towards left or right causes a rotation of the world in the respective sense, giving more space to play around with. Features currently in development are fist gestures to burst through the obstacles, power-ups and some aesthetics. Would love some inputs about the game or code.

We listed it on a google document and went through each one. We picked something we all dealt with, as it personally affected as all. This application became our solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It systematically redirects customer and citizen complaints to appropriate officials who can solve their problems. It works by allowing lower-ranking officials to redirect complaints to higher-ranking ones when they are not capable enough in their position. It cuts down bureaucratic inefficiencies in large organizations, while also building trust and accountability with consumers and citizens.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Meteor.js to build a suitable backend that would perform business logic; then we used the Blaze templating engine to render webpages with relevant data in real time as it was processed by Meteor.js. We used MongoDB to store user and complaint information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>From the front end point of view, we spend a ridiculous and absurd amount of time on adding particles.js to our website. It took us 3 hours, and the solution honestly doesn't even make sense to us. But it works and we got through it as a team!\nFrom the backend point of view, we needed a good way to organize all the data and make it available to the right people. On top of that, there was an error with MongoDB as it would wipe the entire collection of documents it received. \nAs for general problems, we faced version control as a team. Some of us would be on a different versions of the same document, which would prove to be difficult to correct later on, as it's difficult to tell which pieces of code should take precedence.\nLastly, Sleep deprivation was a major problem for all of us, but with the power of redbull and really loud music, we were able to pull through and finish up our project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're all proud of having the courage to work with each other. Friday morning, no one knew anyone, and by friday night we were brainstorming, trying to take PennApps by storm.\nWe're surprised and proud to also say that all of us were awake for 48 hours straight, working to make our product the best it could be.\nWe're proud to also say that not only will our application be on web, it will be on IOS and Android!\nOn top of that, we created a trailer video for our product.\nWe created a gorgeous website with an amazing backend.\nWe stayed motivated, positive, and kept pushing ourselves beyond the limits.\nLastly, we would like to mention, we're all high school students and we have a begginer (to the hackathon culture) on our team. That being said, we still made a fully functional product that is cross platform.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned various skills, things like meteor.js were unheard of before we started this project and as of typing this, half of us are almost fluent in it. We also learned how to represent trees in MongoDB. We learned that amazing things can happen if you set your mind on it. We also learned to bring a sweater to our next hackathon, because it gets extremely cold when night falls. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Shute</h2>\n<p>Although with moments of doubt and almost catching hyperthermia, we decided that if we were to win or lose at PennApps, we would continue to work on this. If a project like this can win even a small category at a large event like this, that means it has potential. We will keep going with this idea and make it amazing. If we do decide to keep moving forward, we would like to add features such as better scalability that would be adapted to wider audiences and applications. We would also like to pay attention to our design, as we believe design is a major component in a successful product.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">premiere-pro</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">adobe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/namecheap\">namecheap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shuteit.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.shuteit.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.shuteit.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on shute's backend (meteor.js and MongoDB).

The Harvard Business Review supports this decision. However, working from home opens it\u2019s own can of worns for those with families or roommates. We looked around to find the best solution and everywhere we looked, we found that being able to control your work environment is the most significant variable in determining your productivity. However, as a student with limited resources, we tried to do our best.</p>\n<p>Since we couldn\u2019t Here is when VR Desk comes to the rescue. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We've created a virtual office for you to spend your work hours. Don\u2019t worry as you are totally connected with the outside world as we keep the virtual workspace synced with your Google Account. Currently, we pull up your emails and calendar events and will never let you miss a thing. Think of it as an extension of the real world into a virtual space.. We are using an Oculus Rift and 2 Thalmic Myo\u2019s. When you hit the Laptop, a list of your emails from GMail comes up in front of you that you can read. When you move around and hit the calendar, our google calendar events are fetched and displayed to you. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We created a 3dsMax scene for an office and hooked it up with an Oculus rift via Unity. We programmed the Myo to allow you to move around, turn in this virtual space with one of your hand while the second myo allows you to interact with the stuff placed in the virtual environment.m with the help of a MYO on one arm. We used another MYO on the second arm to allow interactions with elements inside the room.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting up Oculus Rift and making it work with 2 MYO\u2019s</li>\n<li>Getting the Data from Google APIs into Unity and displaying it in the virtual scene</li>\n<li>Finding out an optimum sensitivity of MYO to control the camera in the Unity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>How Myo works\n*How to integrate Google API's in Unity</li>\n<li>Working with Oculus DK2.

We were in the same building, we just had to get face to face. We wanted to create a tool to make it easier to find people in a crowded place.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Rendezvous uses Bluetooth LE to find nearby friends broadcasting their location with the app. When friends are close, the app notifies the user and shows how far away they are. They can then use the app to navigate towards one another until they meet up, all without wifi or cellular data.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Rendezvous was built for iOS using Objective-C and Swift. It uses the Core Bluetooth framework and iBeacon to broadcast and receive location data from other devices. We also used the Facebook SDK for iOS to authenticate users and identify location broadcasts coming from friends.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We tried several methods of location sharing, but we found that Bluetooth LE offered the best system for close-range communication. Though we looked at making more data available as a service through Bluetooth, we ultimately found that using the iPhone as an iBeacon was more secure and reliable. The system has a range of about 100 meters and proximity information isn't precise, but it's good enough to know who's nearby and to find them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We think the work we put into the interface really shows in the final app and creates a seamless location sharing experience. Once you've logged in the first time, all you have to do is open the app to see who's around and start sharing your location.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This was the first time anyone on the team had worked with iOS, so we learned a lot about Swift and the different iOS SDKs. Though we ultimately didn't use MongoDB to store location data, we had a great time experimenting with it. We also know much more about Bluetooth now than we did going in.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rendezvous</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of directions to take the application. We didn't have time to create an Apple Watch extension, but we think haptic feedback and at-a-glance information would really enhance the experience. We would also like to incorporate more advanced data sharing over Bluetooth. The same system could also easily be reproduced on Android.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibeacon\">ibeacon</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LinkCable/rendezvous\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LinkCable/rendezvous\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Secure Walk", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Secure Walk \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/668/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Secure Walk \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/670/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Secure Walk \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/672/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Secure Walk \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/675/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Secure Walk \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/676/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I wanted to do a simple hack using the Myo and Android-Studio regarding security and public safety.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Secure Walk allows the user to connect a Myo to their Android phone, enter a phone number, and have their phone call that number when the user double-taps their fingers together.

The pressure in the healthcare sector is rising too, due to the growing number of older people that needs care. A well known complaint from Healthcare are the declining levels of personality, because there is less time made available for elderly. This while older people already spend a large amount of their time in loneliness. We think we found a problem that has not been resolved by the multinationals in this world yet. This means there is an opportunity for us as a team at the Pennapps Hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our solution is a platform in which older people, families and caregiver are able to communicate with the aim to be able to better provide for their needs &amp; wants of the elderly. The platform is divided into three devices (for now); Mac, iPad and iPhone.</p>\n<p>The elderly receive a loan tablet at Care house which is has a fixed interface. This interface is simplified so that older people can understand them well. The elderly have the ability to make their needs known to carers and family via the tablet. Care ensures that there is always a suitable caregiver nearby.</p>\n<p>The caregivers are screened by Care and can register themselves in their region on our platform via Mac or the web application. Since elderly people prefer to see the same caregiver for a specific job we always try to match the same person to an individual.</p>\n<p>Family members do not always have the time to care for their own families. Yet they can stay on top of the caretaker by our iPhone application. You can videocall your elderly as well.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We started with raw sketching and brainstorming about the concept. After the brainstorming phase and forming a concept the designers  started to design in Sketch. The developers started with setting up the back-end. There are two web versions / one page applications of our platform. These are built with the help of react js, because it helps with speed of our page. Additionally Webpack &amp; Gulp were used to use Babel. The iOS app is built into Xcode with objective-c.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge was the concept and the iPad application. Because we focus specifically on the elderly, it is important to keep the interface extremely simple. Also determining the functionality was very important because we wanted more than we could actually achieve.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re really proud of the work we did within 36 hours. We designed and built three applications in such a short time. This is partly because we all worked so hard. We are also pleased that we were able to work with new techniques, including reactjs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Care.</h2>\n<p>With this concept we want to start a society where older people have more influence on their healtcare on the right time, care on demand.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rubygems\">rubygems</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sass\">sass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scss\">scss</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gulp-js\">gulp.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webpack</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">babel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mailchimp\">mailchimp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nw.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tokbox\">tokbox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pennapps.bramschulting.com/dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pennapps.bramschulting.com/dashboard\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pennapps.bramschulting.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/3e54a174c708ab47b970ef65574bcb26\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/3e54a174c708ab47b970ef65574bcb26\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rink.hockeyapp.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/69874645913771bcfbed650ae702f814\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/69874645913771bcfbed650ae702f814\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rink.hockeyapp.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed the product, logo and build the iPhone app.", "I designed the product.", "Worked on the back-end API using Ruby on Rails.

We recognize the pain point in memorizing several different passwords for different secure services. In addition, we see that trying to remember, change, and store different passwords can be quite daunting. We quickly realized that <strong>band</strong> could be so much more. With the technology we have here, we plan to create user unique motion passwords. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>band</strong> is a gesture-recognizing wristband which connects to your Bluetooth LE enabled devices. It gives you keyless command over a myriad of common tasks ranging from checking social media, logging into your emails, to playing your favorite Spotify playlists. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the nRF51 DK as our <em>cpu</em> and <em>ble</em> connection. We interfaced a MPU6050 across I2C to retrieve accelerometer and gyro data. Lastly, we used the DMP (Digital Motion Processor) to create reliable data.</p>\n<p>The program begins in a finite state machine. It only progresses further down a branch as long as a chain of gestures is recognized as a computer short cut. If at any time, the user has performed a gesture that is either not similar to one of the recorded gestures or, has not been declared apart of a sequence, the state is reset to the beginning and no action occurs. However, if the user has performed a series of gestures that is programed for a specific short cut, the connected computer will run such program.</p>\n<p>To recognize different gestures, we sample one second of gyroscope and accelerometer data. We then perform a dot matrix algorithm to see if this current second of data was similar to one of the recorded gestures that was recorded. As described earlier, the finite state machine will proceed based on gesture recognition.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the development environment to compile code.\nInitializing the MPU6050 and the DMP.\nChanging the BLE characteristics based on finite state machine changes.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to create a BLE device that could be served as a wireless keyboard. \nWe began to understand the problems of gyroscopic and accelerometer data.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the difficulties in dealing with raw accelerometer and gyroscopic data and experienced challenges in using our given data in the best possible manner (that is, finding the best way to \"clean up\" our data without invariably changing it).</p>\n<h2>What's next for band</h2>\n<p>A number of macro scripts were written on the PC end of the system that can be enabled to respond to stored gestures (which is the only component we were unable to actuate). </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bluefruit-le</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mpu-6050-imu-(with-dmp)</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nrf51-sdk</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["bloom", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bloom \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/857/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bloom \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/424/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bloom \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/435/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bloom \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/425/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bloom \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/426/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bloom \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/428/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"bloom \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/826/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Presentation</h2>\n<p>Check out our slide deck: \n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q61RVPyO6dt_BqJjGP7njflvt0oxcS2U5o53G0VaoSM/present?slide=id.g35f391192_00\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q61RVPyO6dt_BqJjGP7njflvt0oxcS2U5o53G0VaoSM/present?slide=id.g35f391192_00</a></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We all strive to improve ourselves, but it can be difficult to stick to something everyday.</p>\n<p>Although many self help experts claim that a new habit can be formed in just 20-30 days, a recent study at University College London has found that it actually takes, on average, 66 days to form a new habit, depending on the nature of the habit. This application tracks the daily progress of the user trying to form a new habit (or perhaps break a bad habit) using a garden/plant interface. The user is able to make progress in this game by watering the plant once a day to show that they reached their goal for that day. </p>\n<p>Bloom aims to provide a way to track your progress and at the same time, make progress in a game. Neurologist Judy Willis argues that \u201c[games] reward player effort...with acknowledgement of incremental goal progress, not just final product.\u201d All we have to motivate ourselves is the idea of a better self in the future or some final reward that you will receive, such as better health. A game makes it easier to stick to because of the \u201cincremental goal progress\u201d and breaking a large goal into smaller, more achievable goals increases feelings of reward and motivation. Furthermore, being able to track your own progress also helps you stick to the routine; you are able to see how far you have come and how much more you need to go. The success of the Weight Watchers program, in which users track their weight loss progress and points, is a clear example of the benefits of tracking progress. </p>\n<h2>What is bloom?</h2>\n<p>Bloom is an app designed to make it easier to grow habits.</p>\n<p>Grow a little plant every day that you complete your goal. </p>\n<p>Unlock achievements, customizations, and new plants.</p>\n<p>Track your progress and encourage your friends.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of applications for bloom, because there are so many different habits to grow or bad habits to break. Quitting smoking, losing weight, reading everyday, making the bed, eating vegetables...etc. It can also be used as a parenting tool to help parents keep their kids organized and motivated, as well as allowing the parent to track their child's progress. </p>\n<h2>Achievements</h2>\n<p>Not only does growing the plant each day act as a reward on its own, there are also more unlockables and achievements built into the game. You can unlock more customizations, new plants, different backgrounds, and etc. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this web application on Python and Django for the back end, with HTML/CSS/Javascript for the front end, and PostgreSQL for the database.

They'd have to juggle different sites relating to education, housing costs, transportation, etc. There was no one place that encapsulated the core data and provided a much more enjoyable user experience. We drew inspiration from the civic hacking effort. After being exposed to the various public data sets maintained by Philadelphia, we saw a need to consolidate it so that users can get a wholesome picture of the neighborhoods and streamline their housing searches.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We embraced the fact individuals have different wants and needs when it comes to housing. The webapp records the user's preferences and priorities in topics like recreation, healthcare, etc. If the user has young kids and values education, they can weight it higher than other topics. Conversely, if public transportation is not very important, they can reduce the weight. Our webapp then accesses our Azure NoSQL database of publicly available data from Philly (courtesy of opendataphilly.org) and provides a customized ranking of zipcodes overlayed on a map of Philly.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We fed public Philly data from opendataphilly.org's datasets into a Microsoft Azure NoSQL database, ultimately having access to data sorted by zip code. We developed a Python/Flask based HTML/CSS/JS website that takes user preferences and displays a resulting map of favorable zip codes. We interfaced with Azure for our databasing and webapp hosting needs. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were inconsistencies within the formatting of public data from Philly, leading to challenges in parsing and storing it. Additionally, working with Azure databases using Python took some time to figure out. This was also our first large hack with a web-based front-end, so learning to use Flask and web dev frameworks was a huge and exciting challenge. We also got to use Google Maps APIs to process latitude/longitude data as well as embed an interactive map within our website.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We love the idea of socially impactful civic hacking as a way to improve people's lives, and we are proud that our hack can have such an effect. We also overcame numerous technical hurdles in the process, including exploring web development for the first time. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Web dev is hard! Azure is also hard! Everything is hard. But not impossible ;)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Philly Home Finder</h2>\n<p>We want to be able to tap into more public resources to expand the reach of our hack.

But when you look outside of the hackathon world, you often find a lack of excitement and fervor for CS. Why is that? Probably because most middle and high school students aren't even exposed to the world of CS until after graduation, if at all. We wanted to create a fun app that both entertained fellow coders who appreciate being a little silly, while at the same time finding a way to help bring computer science to more schools so that our community can continue to grow.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Twerk For Tech is an iOS app that allows you to challenge your friends to a twerk-off, bet them that you'll win, and do a short twerk to a random song. The loser (most twerks per 10 seconds, with bonus points for rhythm) automatically donates the bet amount of money to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a group pushing for education in all public schools. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used iBeacon to connect two iPhones near each other together and coded in xCode using Swift. For the login and registration system, we used Parse. To calculate the score for twerking, we used the accelerometer in the iPhone. Finally, we used CapitalOne's Nessie API to link user's bank accounts to our app so that they can donate to the cause seamlessly. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Coding the iBeacon was definitely the hardest part, and even once the phones were linked up, perfect connectivity was hard to achieve. Also, syncing the music that plays during the dancing was tricky because the two phones needed to play it at the exact same time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team worked so incredibly well together during the entire course of this project. Considering the fact that only two members knew each other ahead of time, it was amazing how easily we got into the swing of things without quarrels.

Uploading was an especially difficult challenge during development but we are very happy with the results.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned quite a bit about networking. Communication and streaming data is not a simple task and takes extensive planning and fast code. It was a great learning experience for all of this.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sonar</h2>\n<p>There are lots of features that could make Sonar better.

Anyone who used solar to organize their class listings - you know what we're talking about.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SeaCourses is an alternative course search system for Stony Brook University.  SeaCourses allows students to quickly search for classes with multiple filters, as well as see what their schedule might look like based on their selected classes. In addition, there is a very early pre-release alpha version of an automatic schedule builder - all one has to do is to write down which classes (s)he wants to take, and the system will automatically generate schedules for him or her. This system can of course be easily expanded to work with other schools' course systems, as long as it is given the correct data.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We initially downloaded a pdf of all the courses available by Stony Brook for Fall 2015. We then used Nitro PDF to Text converter to convert the pdf document into a text document - we found trying to scrape a pdf with python to be a nightmare. We used python to scrape the text file, utilizing many, many workarounds to deal with the incomplete pdf-text conversion process. Afterwards, a mongodb database was populated (we used mongo simply because it is much quicker to get set up and we did not have the time to design a fully relational SQL database) and most of the class scheduling logic was offloaded to the client's computer via javascript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There was no official Stony Brook course information API - we had to scrape a PDF document, which was a nightmare. Building a schedule builder was also difficult, with organizing cells and actually generating an image (through thoughtfully colored HTML divs).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm quite proud of the python script I wrote to parse through the text document - I'm still not entirely sure how it works, but it's quite cool to see it in action, and actually work (deliver good, accurate information) for over 95% of the text document. I'm also pretty proud of building a rudimentary automatic schedule builder with the team - we hashed it together in the last few hours of the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Scraping a PDF is a nightmare. I'm also most productive at around 3AM.\nIn all honesty though, I learned a lot of Python and the Flask framework the past few days.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SeaCourses</h2>\n<p>Finish the automated schedule builder. Add prereq/coreq support (it's in the database, just not supported yet). Add major/minor requirements - eventually, we hope to have a system where all you need to do is write down your major/minor and what classes you took, and the system can automatically suggest some schedules for you to keep you on track.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yangbrian/seacourses\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yangbrian/seacourses\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the python scripting/back end to ensure that we have the correct data.

That memory still lingers in people's minds, and many people don't realize that in many instances it's not much more expensive than public transportation, although it is considerably more inconvenient. It's no secret that you get what you pay for, and when you pay for Uber you're going to have a better experience with your travel than taking public transportation. The inspiration for this application was to help people make transportation decisions that best fit what they were looking for. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Opo is a multiplatform (iOS, Android, Web) app that helps people figure out which mode of transportation is the best option for them. Using public APIs from Uber, Google Maps, and SEPTA, Opo compares the time and cost associated with traveling from one place to another.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Opo was built with Ionic, a mobile framework that utilizes AngularJS to build dynamic, multiplatform applications.

Platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter are taking over the world when it comes to social networking. Though studies have shown nothing is MORE effective than in-person networking. Actual words only count for about 7% of social interaction, following inflection at 38% and facial expressions at 55%. Traditional networking is almost twice as effective as the internet when it comes to finding a new job.  And, 95 percent say face-to-face meetings are essential for long-term business relationships -  <a href=\"http://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/infographic-the-importance-of-face-to-face-networking\" rel=\"nofollow\">see here</a>.</p>\n<p>This is why we developed HiiFive. We wanted to create a product that would provide people with connections \u2014connections they could tap into outside of the virtual realm. Hiifive is the bridge to face-to-face networking. It is a conversation starter, a dot connector, and much more.</p>\n<h2><strong>What it does</strong></h2>\n<p>HiiFive uses each person's top 5 selected traits and compares them to other people's traits in proximity. If one or more traits match, both parties will get a notification to meet based off of a uniqueness algorithm. A user will have the ability to unlock a world of connections \u2014 meeting people they wouldn't have otherwise.</p>\n<h2><strong>Use cases</strong></h2>\n<p>HiiFive can be used for people who are looking for a \"_______\"; whether be it a new employee, a friend, or a mentor. HiiFive connects people with similar interests/traits in the areas of Groups, Looking For, Place, Education, and Occupation. By having only matching traits revealed, users are encouraged to talk to the match to discover their remaining mystery traits.</p>\n<p>Example cases range from a local college student looking for a mentor, a recruiter looking for developers, or a visiting tourist looking for someone from their hometown.</p>\n<h2><strong>How we built it</strong></h2>\n<p>We built HiiFive in 36 short hours in Philadelphia at PennApps. Our team split up tasks to crank out our final solution.</p>\n<h2><strong>What we learned</strong></h2>\n<p>Our team really embraced the importance of perseverance and the idea that you're never done learning. Although we came from different backgrounds, we worked together with our variety of abilities to make a product that would stick.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/core-location\">core-location</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apple-push-notifications\">apple-push-notifications</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple-watch</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hiifive.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hiifive.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hiifive.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["House of Bots", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"House of Bots \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/791/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>With a plethora of candidates running in 2016.

As <strong>fluX</strong> continues to grow, we will increase the measured parameters to generate an even more immersive and specific analysis of flu spread in the country.

The patients' info is provided by the EPIC FIHR health API.  The backend API uses NodeJS and Express to expose the methods that the interfaces need to interact with the database.  </p>\n<h3>The <a href=\"http://pennapps.co\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Web App</strong></a></h3>\n<p>Doctors use this interface to manage their patients and write prescriptions.  They can view their patients' info and assess their data on the fly to help give a more accurate diagnosis.  When creating a prescription, the doctor can use text expansion to easily add more detailed notes.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>input: TAKE 1 TAB QD HS\noutput: TAKE 1 TABLET ONCE DAILY AT BEDTIME\n</code></pre>\n<h3>The <strong>Android App</strong></h3>\n<p>The patient downloads the app to help them keep track of their medications.  Their prescriptions are automatically synced when they are added through the doctor interface.  The doctor's directions are parsed to determine reminder times for the patient, which are implemented as push notifications.  The patient can also see the contact info for their doctor and pharmacist, and call with one tap.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://pennapps.co/video\" rel=\"nofollow\">Video Reel</a></h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/epic\">epic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/devanshk/MedSync-Android\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/devanshk/MedSync-Android\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DomTheDeveloper/RXconnect\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/DomTheDeveloper/RXconnect\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Capital Pebble", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Capital Pebble \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/577/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Capital Pebble \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/578/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Capital Pebble \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/579/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Capital Pebble \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/580/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Capital Pebble \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/581/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>CapitalPebble</h1>\n<p>Capital One client on Pebble Watch\n-Check your balances  &amp;

Because of the number of bluetooth devices in the arena, we were forced to abandon the project, which would have only worked in the absence of all network signals (the noise would not allow for a clean reading necessary to calibrate the device for our P300 Speller). Thus, we chose to deal with muscle movement as opposed to simply brain waves.</p>\n<p>We were able to reverse-engineer the Morsel API to work for a web application. We then imported code we wrote, as well as reverse-engineered APIs from Facebook, Twitter, etc. to simplify the functionality of the app.</p>\n<p>We learned a lot about polyglot applications, as well as the difficulty of building chemical hardware in a 48 hour hackathon (especially if so many hardware hacks are taking place simultaneously.) Eventually, after converting our native web app to Swift, we used ManifoldJS to additionally create a JSON that would allow us to export our application to Windows and Android devices as well.</p>\n<p>We're hoping to continue developing the features, and hopefully find a P300 library for Neuromore (it has yet to be invented) to continue our research in machine learning brain waves to form words.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">manifoldjs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pizotal.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pizotal.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pizotal.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["ReRep", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Every time I meet someone new, and hear \"Oh!

But in some senses, you could consider ReRep a data collection app masquerading as a social media app. The really technically interesting thing about RealRep is the way correlations between different hashtags appear. And that's some really cool data. For example-is there a correlation between users who are associated with #gamer and #nintendo? (Signs point to yes, btw)</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built ReRep using javascript, node.js, dynamodb, aws, HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. Pretty common for a web app-except for dynamodb.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Most of our challenges ended up happening in what might be considered the more technically easier part of the project; i.e. when my teammates and I were creating the UI. There was a suprising amount of hurdles associated with the data presentation -we had large amounts of user-generated data that we were trying to present in a social-media friendly format. There were numerous issues associated with trying to stick the back end and the front end together (which ultimately culminated in scrapping multiple hours of work on the UI), but we were eventually able to get the app up and running in a user-friendly fashion. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We were able to get a fully functioning app off the ground in 48 hours, and I'm proud of the way we combined the social media and data collection aspects in a novel way. After all, we're basically encouraging people to submit data in a way that is built on love of social media.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ReRep</h2>\n<p>There are still two sets of features that we need to build for ReRep. Most notably, the distinguishing factor between friends and non-friends.

While developing our previous idea, an automated idea board that provides you with inspiration based on semantic keywords, we realized there is no solution to dynamically create pleasing color schemes for arbitrary colors. Pizzazz is that solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Pizzazz is a robust API that is built to dynamically adapt your interface to match user-generated content. It makes the lives of developers easier by providing a tool for generating color schemes, and design recommendations effortlessly.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>It is built using a Node.JS server that runs algorithms to determine the right combinations to \u201cpizzazz\u201d your life. The frontend uses SASS and jQuery, with Foundation powering the grid layout.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integration of separately developed modules is often times the most difficult part of projects.

The process of linking the front-end with the back-end led us discover a great deal of problems with each of our codes and required a number of quick\u2019n\u2019dirty changes to get right.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we\u2019re proud of</h2>\n<p>Our design tool wouldn\u2019t be perfect if it didn\u2019t have a crisp and beautiful design. And it does.</p>\n<p>In addition, it is our first time working as a team. We accomplished a great deal when taking into account that we pivoted to this idea in the last third of the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it\u2019s better to go to a hackathon with a more solid idea of what we wanted to do. In addition, a hacks in the intersection of two areas (design &amp; development) have great potential.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pizzazz</h2>\n<p>Pizzazz is a tool for developing color schemas to match user-generated content. Next steps include API endpoints to analyze images and videos to extract dominant colors and create color schemas based on that.</p>\n<p>The future of Pizzazz also lies in semantic driven design. We wish to instantly create color schemas based on semantic keywords.

For example, I live in Rodin college house on campus, and when I walk to Wawa I know there are 20+ others in Rodin who want Wawa as well. The idea is that they log on to the app and request their food items and how much they are willing to pay for them. Since I am headed back to Rodin anyway, I gladly pick up anothe meal in order to make a small sum. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used meteor.js for the back end and most of the front end. We used meteor in order to access MongoDB, where we stored food deliveries, orders, account user names, etc. We also used some simple css/html editing to make it look slightly nicer than black text on a white background. Using meteor will allow us to port it to an iPhone and Android without any effort. We are hosting the MongoDB remotely on BlueMix, and hosting the rest of the sight (due to technical issues with BlueMix and Meteor.js) on Linode.

Since I've always had an interest in seeing how effective technology can be at improving people's health, specifically in prosthetics, I decided to design, build, and test a prosthetic hand at this hackathon as a personal challenge for myself.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>I created Project: Prosthetic in order to achieve three very specific goals towards making usable prosthetic attachments more affordable and more easily manufactured:</p>\n<p><strong>1.)</strong> To create a prosthetic hand using less than $100 in material costs.</p>\n<p><strong>2.)</strong> To achieve basic motor functionality with this medical device such as grasping, hand signs, and writing.</p>\n<p><strong>3.)</strong> To finalize a design and to finish a prototype within the 36 hours I had at PennApps.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I first drafted a rough sketch of what I wanted the prosthetic hand to look and how I expected it to function. Next, I refined those drawings by drawing them up in a CAD program and making multiple additions and subtractions to the design of each individual component of the device. The majority of my time was spent working on the designs of each individual part of the device as a change in one part would usually mean an update to another part in order to maintain the synergy of the overall device. Once satisfied with my overall design in my CAD drawings, I prepared the files necessary for 3D printing, printed my parts, and did some finishing work and assembly to complete my prototype.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>By far the largest challenge I encountered was trying to get all of my prototype's parts printed efficiently and on time. Despite having four 3D printers available to us, I did not account for the large volume of people who also had plans to print parts during the course of PennApps. As a result, I was unable to print even half of all the parts I needed for my prototype. To remedy this handicap, I spent more effort towards improving my CAD drawings and making them more interactive with people so that they could be showcased in lieu of the physical prototype.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Figuring out how to mechanically incorporate opposable thumbs into my device was a truly difficult task. In the end, however, I was able to use a novel technique to not only replicate the thumb's swivel, but also its ability to swivel in different planes of motion. I am also quite proud of how the parts of my prototype that did successfully print turned out; they definitely look like they came straight out of a research laboratory.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Fingers are really repetitive to make. On a more serious note, I became more familiar with 3D printing processes and CAD design. I also got a better grasp of what designing products entails, specifically prosthetics. You have to consider both your own needs for the project and the customer's needs for the product. Being able to strike a balance between these two requirements will yield a much better and creative result than catering specifically to either the customer or yourself will.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project: Prosthetic</h2>\n<p>Project: Prosthetic is definitely well within its infancy and still has a lot of room to develop. I, for one, am excited to pursue improvements to the first prototype I made at PennApps and will most likely be contributing more time into this project throughout this coming school year. Who knows? Maybe I'll be able to streamline the aesthetics of the hand and add another individual finger alongside the index finger. I'm certainly looking forward to the upgrades I can bring to the table for this hack.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solidworks</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iterative-design</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hand-tools</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cad</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Nutrimon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Nutrimon \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/718/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Nutrimon \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/719/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Nutrimon \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/720/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Maintaining your health is important for many aspects of your life. If you don't take care of yourself your concentration, fitness and mental agility levels can drop. There are many existing systems with this goal in mind however they require a lot of manual data entry. We sought out to eliminate this with our implementation.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Nutrimon is a system which can be installed within your cabinet or fridge and will keep track of what you put in or take out. It is built on a mixture of traditional barcode technology and our new weight based detection system. While the logic is processed in an external server, the main interface is on your phone.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>In order to build Nutrimon we split up into two smaller teams, a hardware and a software team. Which aimed to tackle their respective fields.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the problems with splitting into smaller teams was communication. Often there were moments where the two teams would have completely different ideas of what was going on. The biggest challenge which almost ruined the entire project was how long it took to find the appropriate tech for the tasks we needed to undertake.</p>\n<p>As a side note, the biggest technical feat was definitely that of quite literally _ hacking _ a Bluetooth Scale into something which could be read by an Arduino and have its data processed by the Go server.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>On this project I learned the importance of communication and making sure that everyone is on the same page.

Captain aims to change that, but does much more than just make the shortest path between multiple destinations possible.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Captain helps you get around more efficiently by avoiding long lines when stores are least busy and computing the most direct route between multiple destinations to find the most optimal time to visit each location.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I started with a lot of testing Friday night and describing algorithms on paper. One of the tests I started in PHP became the current live version of Captain. The frontend was written in the usual HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I used an <a href=\"http://www.getmdl.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">open-source Material Design framework</a> to help with the frontend design.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Working with and making use of the data for the most part required a lot of thinking and planning. One specific time this proved difficult was when I was trying to incorporate the \"popular times\" data in order to determine when the line in the store would be the shortest. Eventually, I saw that the actual numbers of visitors for each period of time was not important, but rather the ratio between each period of time was important. Additionally, I was able to convince myself that the scale did not matter in this case, as the ratio can be scaled infinitely larged and still retain the same proportions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Working with the Uber API, getting an Apache web server up and running on Linode with a .CO domain, calculating barycentric coordinates in order to factor in the arrangement of destinations on a map (direct paths).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to deal with data gathered and give appropriate weighting to each factor (and set of data) in order to come up with the most accurate score for sorting the destinations into an order.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Captain</h2>\n<p>Definitely more factors for sorting the results (orders you can go to the destinations in).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/namecheap\">namecheap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mdl</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material-design</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/font-awesome\">font-awesome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ayeayecaptain.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ayeayecaptain.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ayeayecaptain.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Sex Ed 2.0", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We where inspired because we have all seen how inept schools are these days at teaching sex ed.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>In the U.S. only 21 states require sexual education to be taught at school, and of those only 18 require that the lessons be medically accurate.

Why buy something and spend money for only one use? Why not just share it with someone around you? Chances are that there is someone around you that has the item you're looking for just lying around ready to use. Thus we built sendr. We believe in the power of community and we believe that sendr can connect more people, reduce personal spending, increase recycling and reusing, and create an underlying shared economy.  </p>\n<h2>Where'd the Idea Come From?</h2>\n<p>When I visited Spain this summer, I knew I was only going to be there for about a month and so I wanted to avoid buying as much stuff as possible (after all I would throw it all away coming back to the states). I knew that someone in my general area had pots and pans they weren't using and that they could easily allow me to borrow for a month; but there was no way for me to organize the transaction. Thus, we built sendr: an app that uses location services to create a shared economy where you can share everything. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sendr allows you to simply enter what you're looking for (let's say an iPhone 5 charger), how much you're willing to pay for a specific amount of time (for example $2 for 1 hour), and then any sellers in the area receive a notification that you're looking to buy the item. Sellers can then login and say that they are willing to rent out their item for a particular price (while providing a picture of the product as well). Then, the buyers (\"renters\") pay for the transaction and will be able to chat to determine a place where they can meet. The app is completely location based so that users only see items that users are looking to rent in your near vicinity. In the meantime, the company--sendr--will monetize by claiming 5% of all transaction costs. Users can pay with their bank information or using Apple Pay; we integrated the vital Capital One API to allow uses to pay with and to transfer funds between them. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built Sendr completely on iOS Swift (mainly) with a Parse backend. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We integrated the innovative technologies such as Capital One API and Apple Pay into our app. The app is also completely location based and so you would only see items that people are looking to rent in your near vicinity.</p>\n<h2>What's next for sendr</h2>\n<p>We're going to commercialize sendr at Penn and try to build up a critical mass of users. Because the product does follow network effects, we're going to try to start small and convince everyone in one floor of our dorm-room building to use the product; we're going to continually iterate and build up a product that these 20 college students just love and use on a daily basis. Then we will spread to other floors in the same building and then the building itself. With this \"fail early and fail often\" technique, we hope to eventually create a product that becomes as synced into our society as Uber or Airbnb are. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/capital-one\">capital-one</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uikit\">uikit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple-map</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple-pay</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/RajatBhageria/PennAppsXII/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/RajatBhageria/PennAppsXII/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Taklo - VR ATM and Dashboard", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Taklo - VR ATM and Dashboard \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/403/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Like medical schools using the Rift and Leap to practice performing surgery, the members of Team Taklo were interested in exploring the potential of VR in education.

Using Capital One's Customer API, the user can make deposits and withdrawals from the ATM, as well as see more details about its location.  Through EA Pathfinder, one can access and control the Unity game through their mobile device.  More challenging levels would test the user's attention to detail as they avoid possible ATM fraud and losing their credit card.</p>\n<p>Taklo uses a PHP script on a web server to power a dashboard that displays the user's history of transactions, as well as the time and news headlines.  Taklo hopes to implement a feature that visualizes the user's data and analyzes the user's history of transactions and identify possibly \"unhealthy\" patterns in spending.

How do we know which firms to trust? How should regulators know which advisers are worth looking into? </p>\n<p>There are also many publicly available resources to streamline data collection on financial firms and advisers, but most aren't used due to inherent complexity.</p>\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>Find a way to simplify the public adviser data to make it easier to read for both potential investors and for regulators.</p>\n<h2>Our Creation</h2>\n<p>Advised </p>\n<p>An iOS app that retrieves and aggregates data from SEC filings. It utilizes many publicly disclosed factors such as complaint history, violation logs, number of jobs, and years in the industry to generate <strong>one core risk coefficient</strong>. </p>\n<p>Both potential advisers as well as regulators can use the application to find and discover potential investors they may be interested in. </p>\n<h2>Technical</h2>\n<p>We used a python script to pull and interpret the iAPD SEC data set. It filters out unnecessary information and focuses on factors that would tell us more about the adviser's record. This ultimately is put through an algorithm to generate the risk coefficient. A higher coefficient would mean that trusting this adviser is more risky. </p>\n<p>On the iOS side, we made a local copy of all of the data using CoreData. We then began visually representing the data in iOS using UIKit and Core Graphics. Among our most difficult technical challenges was to successful import such a large amount of data, and providing meaningful ways to present it. Our iOS app focused mainly on design and user experience, to provide an intuitive way for users to interact with the adviser data set. </p>\n<h2>Extension</h2>\n<p>Our app and processed information can be used in multiple ways. We published our filtered information including the risk coefficient publicly online as well in more conventional JSON format. \nwhich allows future developers to continue to improve on it. </p>\n<p>Using a subset of the same data, we also created a d3.js animation that finds the average risk factor of each firm using the information about the advisers from those firms. This gives us a more complete picture about not just specific advisers, but also their operating environments, whether or not certain firms are more likely to engage in or reward more risky/stable behavior. </p>\n<p>In addition, because we are posting our filtered data set publicly, we encourage and hope future developers to continue to improve on the data. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/core-data\">core-data</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sec-data</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Cloudsource", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cloudsource \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/340/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cloudsource \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/404/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cloudsource \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/092/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cloudsource \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/093/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cloudsource \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/471/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The goal is to bring visibility and success to impactful projects that are data constrained.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Cloudsource is a platform for contributing computation time to meaningful projects in a simple, easy way.

I miss my mom's food. However, I remembered that there was a time when my mom, as a homemaker, used to cook extra food on the side to sell in the local area. There are people looking to make money from the extra food they want to make just like my mom, and there are people like me wanting home cooked food. Therefore lets bridge the gap!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It provides a platform for cooks to sign on to the app and feature food they are cooking for the day. On the other hand it provides a user a platform to find food gourmet home cooked food at any time they want. The application using the Plaid api also understand the users past spending habits on food and gives suggestions on the food the user should try. The application also uses the uber api to estimate the distance and cost of a trip to the location of the food. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built the app all in the android studio, referencing api's as needed. We made http posts to the Plaid api and utilized a wrapper for the uber api to implement in the java language used in Android. All of the layouts were designed in Android studio using the editor provided. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenges we ran into involved managing the networking for the different api's we used. Small issues such as thread cross over and outdated jar files can create large issues when trying to test different features of the application. As a result we had to be very careful in how we made our requests to our services. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This is a project we truly believe in and we feel proud that we made a product that I believe can be very useful. Technologically we felt most proud of how we were able to use the different api's encouraged by mentors at PennApps to create features that we normally would not have used previously. The plaid and uber features really make this application unique from other \"for x\" service apps and we feel proud for the higher analytics we provide. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that design can be the toughest yet most important part of a project. Creating the layouts and designing the interface was tedious and difficult. However, even as we went through the user experience we realized how important a clean and appealing design was for generating interest in the utility. Another important point we learned was that one should really plan out a workflow for a user experience thoughtfully before jumping into development. Technologically we learned a lot about android development. Overall we feel a lot more comfortable and adept and developing android applications. </p>\n<h2>What's next for MyChef</h2>\n<p>We have a strong base application. However, we need to set it up to scale. To do so we need to start working to build the platform up enough that we can sign on cooks to be on the application in the future. This will require a large marketing effort however we are confident that once we start developing our product to scale and also provide this strong base for generating income, workers will come!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/plaid\">plaid</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Finode", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Finode \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/778/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Finode \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/783/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Our group was immediately interested in working with financial data when we saw FINRA at the sponsor presentations during the opening ceremony. None of us had ever worked with financial data in a setting like this before, so we thought that it would be an interesting and challenging project for the four of us.</p>\n<p>Finode is a webapp that acts as a visualization tool for stock trading data from the past twenty years which was provided by FINRA. In addition to the centerpiece visualization capabilities, Finode features a stock trading game, which allows the player to select a sector of the economy to trade in and take them through time starting in approximately 1995, allowing them to buy, sell, and hold stocks as they please.</p>\n<p>Finode was built primarily using Flask, D3.js, and MySQL, along with other front-end technologies.</p>\n<p>One of the largest issues our team face while developing Finode was the sheer amount of data provided by FINRA. None of us had ever worked with a dataset this large before, so it was a new challenge to interpret.

However, the real fun is when you actually hit the virtual golf ball. The putter is instrumented with special hardware to deliver a haptic sensation of hitting a golf ball in synchronization with the virtual experience.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We instrumented the putter with a Wii remote which gives us accelerometer reading of the orientation of the putter. We use this along with Oculus Rift DK2's head tracking information to control the virtual putter. Furthermore, we have an arduino which controls a servo motor and an electromagnet. Together, they release a golf ball that is hooked up to the putter at the correct timing to deliver the haptic sensation of hitting the ball.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into lots of challenges with various hardwares, especially the Wii remote. Originally, we planned to use the Wii remote's IR tracking system to get both the position and orientation of the putter. However, the Wii remote's tracking turned out to be very unreliable. It can only track up to 4 IR light sources, and all 4 are needed to solve for all the degrees of freedom which could not be done reliably. In the end, we resorted to using only accelerometer data from the Wii remote.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We also ran into some challenges while building an electromagnet that can trigger the release of the golf ball attached to putter. The electromagnet required at least 1A of current, but we did not have any high load resistors that can handle this kind of load. We worked this around by remembering Kirchoff's law and connecting lots of small resistors in parallel. We also bumped up the strength of our electromagnet by attaching neodymium magnets to the other side of the electromagnet.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a tremendous amount about how the Wii remote works by spending numerous hours with it. We also learned valuable hardware lessons such as workarounds with limited resources and quickly changing designs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ultimate VR Minigolf</h2>\n<p>Because we ran into so many unexpected challenges, we didn't get to quite refine all the details and fine tune different parameters. We would like to work up on these details in the future to complete the ultimate VR minigolf experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wii-remote</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/se210/VRMiniGolf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/se210/VRMiniGolf\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Phill Me In", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Phill Me In \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/373/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Phill Me In \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/374/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Phill Me In \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/348/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What is Phill Me In?</h2>\n<p>Phill Me In is a web application that rates locations in Philadelphia based on a number of factors. The data is mostly from the OpenDataPhilly portal, which has collections of CSV's filled with the city's data. However, this data is not easily accessible to most people; it's tedious to filter through relevant datasets, and further, make sense of latitudes, longitudes, and figure out what's <em>really</em> around you.</p>\n<p>This is why we created Phill Me In: it does all the hard work for you. We've fed in datasets on a variety of topics, which accumulate to over 80,000 rows of data. All that we ask the user to do is to enter an address in Philly, and Phill Me In will look through the megabytes of data to show you what's relevant. It rates neighborhoods based on a number of parameters, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security</li>\n<li>Emergency Services</li>\n<li>Sanitation</li>\n<li>Air Pollution</li>\n<li>Health Services</li>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>Parks and Recreation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can even choose one of these seven parameters instead of entering an address, and we'll show you a heat map of that parameter overlaid on the map of Philly (some of these visualizations actually have very interesting geographical trends).</p>\n<h2>Why would I use this?</h2>\n<p>It's a great tool if you're a house-hunting student in Philly, or want to analyze local trends as a government official. The aim of Phill Me In is to simplify the process of looking through <em>huge</em> datasets and various sources of information to pick out what you need: and further, present it to the user through intuitive visualizations (like heat maps and bar graphs).</p>\n<p>Even if you don't fall into any of those categories, it's still a good way to get to know your neighborhood -- there's a good chance you'll find out things about where you live that you never knew before!</p>\n<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>\n<p>Our biggest problem was that we had <em>too</em> much data. We didn't want it to go to waste, of course, but wanted to keep the computations quick at the same time. For example, we have a dataset with over 70,000 Crime Reports from 2014. To create a heat map for the safety parameter, we would have to run through all these rows for every locality in Philly (~300 of them). Fortunately, we found a couple of hacks around this (caching the results certainly helps) eventually.</p>\n<p>The other challenge was making sense of the data that we had. For example, how would we convert data from Air Monitoring Stations into Air Pollution scores for the entire city?</p>\n<h2>What's next for Phill Me In</h2>\n<p>A system like this will only improve when there's more sources of data, as well as continuously updated data to work with. Phill Me In's simplicity allows us to scale to include new data sets relatively easily. After making Phill Me In, we hope to see more cities make their data openly available for similar use. We hope that products like these will improve governments' efficiency and strengthen the communication between citizens and their elected representatives.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/font-awesome\">font-awesome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phpmyadmin\">phpmyadmin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.phillmein.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.phillmein.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.phillmein.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Gathered datasets; created the heat map and bar charts graphics", "Backend, server management, database management, data processing, little bit of front end", ""]], ["The Trumpinator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Trumpinator \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/262/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Trumpinator \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/266/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A peer made Tay-Text, an app that allows people to communicate with Taylor Swift lyrics.

I found examples of things I wanted to do that I could copy and modify, web pages that explained things, and mentors who could help me figure out the hardest parts of the code.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p> I'm proud to have completed my first app and to have significantly increased my knowledge about HTML, Javascript, webpages, and the cloud.  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p> I learned how to build web pages, write scripts, build and use objects in object oriented programming, create cloud servers on AWS and Azure, and port apps </p>\n<h2>What's next for The Trumpinator</h2>\n<p>I hope to add a google search dropdown to the submit bar, cognitive search of texts to gather meaning, expand the quote library, and eventually conduct accurate and automatic video to speech on youtube videos and mp3s.  This will allow this project to expand beyond amusement.  Applications could include transcription, increased public awareness of issues in Congress, and faster analysis and cataloguing of video content</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">manifoldjs</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://thetrumpinator.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://thetrumpinator.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>thetrumpinator.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/newemailjdm/Trump\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/newemailjdm/Trump\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I conceived and built the app.  "]], ["Wander", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wander \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/906/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wander \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/931/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wander \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/905/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wander \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/907/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wander \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/904/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wander \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/908/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Wander matches your likes and interests based on images with potential vacation destinations, from familiar towns to exotic places you've never heard of.

The final result may be an not optimal system in terms of software. There was also a lot of shifting in what languages, software, and methods to use.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The fact that we each learned a great deal over the past 2 days, and were motivated to get a job done. Hearing of other groups that break apart under the pressure of no sleep, or no progress humbles me. I, Jeechieu, am grateful that this weekend worked out as productive as it was.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned whats the next step in learning software engineering. This was literally my first step into any type of work in programming. It was an enlightening experience, especially the workshops. I learned how API's can differ, how different programs can function together in ways I didn't know prior, I project I'll learn a lot in the presentations, and finally I learned the true realistic values of learning software engineering.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Micro Stalker</h2>\n<p>Personally, with the busy schedule I'll be having these next months, in conjunction with the conviction I gained to work even harder on the next Pennapps Hackathon, this idea may end up scrapped by the end of this ordeal. I'd appreciate an mobile app like this to exist, many a times I found myself in the grand presence of a high up official, but actually knew nothing about them. It was sort of embarrassing once to talk to the vice-president of GE electrics on a level that doesn't even skim his professional expertise.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linkedin\">linkedin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ssh</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">power-shell</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Struggled through our first Hackathon to create something worthy of the competition.

Pets can't talk about their injuries, so they can often go unnoticed. How do we provide proactive care?</p>\n<p>Our solution is PetApps, a system to quickly diagnose and simplify domestic animal care. The mobile app and wearable hardware companion tracks the motion of your pet to determine if it is injured or in distress. The app then guides you through the process of getting your pet the care it deserves.</p>\n<h2>Frontend / Mobile App</h2>\n<p>The mobile application serves to alert the pet owner when their pet is in need of their attention. The app receives up to date information via Google Cloud Messaging. A personalized push notification is displayed when a limp is detected.</p>\n<p>The app guides the user through the next stages of animal care by allowing the user to find vet hospitals nearby and then request an uber, call the vet hospital, or navigate via Google maps directly from the app.</p>\n<p>Users can stay engaged with the app through persistent notifications with when navigating to the vet hospital for easy interaction with the app.</p>\n<p>The app also runs on Android Wear which receives mirrored data from the phone, displays it, and allows the user to take actions.</p>\n<h2>Backend / Machine Learning</h2>\n<p>Our machine learning algorithm starts when the user first takes a step after putting on the device. Accelerometer data from every step is transmitted from the Thalmic Myo over Bluetooth to a nodejs server, which transmits the data over UDP to a compute server written in Python. These accelerations are then resampled into 64 sample blocks using Secret Rabbit Code (libsamplerate) for step length invariance. Then, a fast fourier transform is applied to the samples. These fourier transformed step samples are analyzed by a pre-trained Scikit-Learn logistic regressor and classified as either limping steps or normal steps. </p>\n<p>In order to visualize the function of the machine learning algorithm, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the 64-dimensional features to two dimensions which can be easily plotted. The normal walking (blue) and limping (red) data are shown as two distinct clusters with the steps from the normal walking gif shown in pale green. For these images and a deeper dive into the data, head to our imgur gallery @ <a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/1FGKC\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://imgur.com/gallery/1FGKC</a>.</p>\n<p>If a certain percentage of limping steps are detected, a message is sent over Google Cloud Messaging to the Android app, which alerts the pet owner to the state of their pet. The owner can alternatively be alerted via SMS on any phone using Twilio. We chose the Intel Edison to run the machine learning algorithm as the platform has an appropriate processing power and is small enough to eventually be integrated into a dog collar.</p>\n<h2>Contact Us</h2>\n<p>If you would like any more information about the project or would like to get in contact, you can reach us by email at <a href=\"mailto:admin@maxbareiss.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">admin@maxbareiss.com</a> or on twitter at @chrisfreder (Christopher Frederickson) or @handnf (Nick Felker).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">noble</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn\">scikit-learn</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-wear\">android-wear</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud-messaging\">google-cloud-messaging</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the machine learning backend.", "Built Android app and Android Wear app, got Myo linked with Edison, produced and edited video", ""]], ["Cardboard LiveVR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardboard LiveVR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/297/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Cardboard LiveVR was one of those shower ideas, the ones that seem to hit you out of nowhere but you must have garnered inspiration for from somewhere.  The whole idea stems from the fact that, in our ever-connected world, most of the things we tend to experience online are pre-rendered, overdone, or just plain virtual.  Cardboard LiveVR offers a live look at a certain part of the world.  Besides the obvious novelty, a LiveVR system mounted on a mobile platform could offer unparalleled exploratory experiences: drone pilots with a first-person birds' eye view, anyone?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Cardboard LiveVR offers a new type of user experience in the field of live video.  As you move with Google Cardboard up to your face, a camera mounted on pan and tilt hardware mimics your movement.  This in turn gives you a fuller, more customized view of your surroundings.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Cardboard LiveVR is a project in two parts.  On the user-end, the UI is an HTML/CSS/Javascript implementation of Google Cardboard.  Instead of using the Cardboard SDK, Cardboard LiveVR is designed to be able to run on many different smartphone platforms without a need for repackaging or redistribution.  Javascript looks for motion events and relays them to the server over HTTP.  On the server-side, Cardboard LiveVR is powered first and foremost by a Raspberry Pi running Python, specifically the Flask web framework.  As motion events are POSTed to the server, Python and Arduino interact over serial to move a webcam.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Javascript with MotionEvents is not the happiest of pairings.  Although horizontal motion was easily understood and integrated, vertical movement led to strange behavior, with the code being unable to understand the difference between movement up and movement down.  Because of this, unfortunately, tilt is currently unavailable on Cardboard LiveVR.  In addition, general strange behavior plagues the code responsible for handling motion resulting in lefts when there should be rights and vice-versa.  Despite a lot of testing, this behavior seems emblematic of using Javascript to do the job of native software.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This is the first full hardware hack I've personally seen through to the end. Despite several annoying setbacks (did someone say Linux permission quirks?), the project was actually completed.  I also used Javascript somewhat effectively for the first time, despite issues in the way it handles motion.   Finally, the piece holding in the small, disused tilt servo is the first thing I've designed and 3D printed myself</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>-Don't use Javascript for motion events\n-You CAN use HTML and CSS for simple animations in Google Cardboard\n-Flask doesn't like getting smacked by hundreds of HTTP requests in a matter of seconds\n-The proper code is '''document.getElementById(whatever)''' and if you accidentally type ID instead of Id, you will be very confused at 1 o'clock in the morning wondering why everything broke\n-You REALLY shouldn't edit permissions on /etc/ in Linux.  ONLY bad things will happen.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cardboard LiveVR</h2>\n<p>Hopefully, Cardboard LiveVR will continue development, perhaps away from Javascript and towards a language that can actually handle motion events.

We walked past a number of really common establishments but were hesitant from entering as we looked inside and saw fewer people than we expected.</p>\n<p>This is a huge problem for bar owners and bar goers as it creates a viscous cycle of bar goers not wanting to go into empty bars/clubs and as a result bar owners lose money. We've seen some current solutions for this problem, such are bar promoters physically reaching out to people to come to a bar for at a certain time for special deals, other times there are on site promoters to tell people to come in! But as you can tell their reach is ever so limiting and this solution is effective.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>So we created On The House, it's an application that will allow bar owners to deal with this problem more effectively. Bar owners can push coupons to users of On the House that are in the area, offering a free drink or another sweet deal, and once user claims the promotion, (s)he has a time limit (30 or 45 min) to get themselves to a bar and actually get their drink. Short expiry time allows managers to fill in their establishments fast and users to get free stuff. Bar owners have a lot of control on how many people can claim the promotion, what the promotion might be, how long users have to claim the promotion etc. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We have used a linux server running Apache, PHP and MySQL hosted on Linode as our backend server. There is a web interface for promotion management for bar owners and an iOS app for users.</p>\n<h2>What's next for On the House</h2>\n<p>We actually want to turn this idea into real business.

I came across this idea in <strong>MGMT100</strong> as we discussed how leaders (in specific teachers) have to change the way that they teach according to the group they are with. It is a hard task unless you receive some good, instant data back so we came across this idea. </p>\n<p>It allows a teacher to create a <strong>classroom</strong> and students to join and leave and come back as they please by just entering the <strong>class id</strong>. There are <strong>no usernames or passwords</strong> to conserve ease and anonymity in the classroom. Then the student can input his/her satisfaction with the exact current state of the lecture/material and the aggregate data will show up in styled graphs for the teacher. It shows the <strong>percentage of satisfaction across the different styles of learning</strong>. This is web based, so android and iOS may use it, but there is a specific android wrapper that it is specially designed for. Lastly, there is a pebble app the connects on the teachers end so that the data may be viewed with ease while teaching.</p>\n<p>We built the interface in <strong>HTML5 and JS</strong> and the backend in <strong>PHP5.5</strong>. The android wrapper is built in <strong>Java</strong> and the Pebble App is built in <strong>JS</strong>. </p>\n<p>It is very difficult to keep the backend clean and organized while still maintaining all of the data needed on each user. We spend many hours debugging the complicated logical tracks that happen in the background to ensure it was <strong>flawless</strong>.</p>\n<p>I am proud of the <strong>simplicity and intuitiveness</strong> of the app, while still providing a great service with great potential. </p>\n<p>I have learned that projects that may seem simple can be just as complicated as any other app, because while there may not be an absurd amount of computational power used, the data is all precise and there is no room for error while still having to solve the puzzle of keeping students separate and unable to corrupt the system.</p>\n<p>What we would like to see in the future is an iOS wrapper, a more stable graphically advanced version of the Pebble App (we have graphics running but the sdk struggles in compiling.) Lastly we aim to reach out to paperless and regular classrooms in the near future to offer this free service to them after posting out pebble app and android apps on their respective stores.

wanted to use MATLAB to create a cool project, and I wanted to make it easy to do analytics on Stock Data. When I first started, I realized it was incredibly difficult to load MySQL data into MATLAB (or any software) and then apply some analytics to it. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The class contains many functions which make it easy to extract data from a database with a fairly basic knowledge of MySQL and MATLAB. It can easily create scatter plots to plot certain data sets against each other, and it can also calculate basic quantifiers for sets of data such as Mean of Variance. Additionally, I created a function that can take stock data and convert it to an audio file (I thought it would be interesting if it could make a song or something).</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built this project using MATLAB and MySQL. Essentially I use a driver to load up Stock Data from a MySQL database into matlab. Then I can systematically analyzing certain sections of the data using scatter plots or quantifiers like Mean and Variance.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I had to learn how to use MySQL and the command line to first look at the database. As I realized how large the data set was, I noticed that I could not analyze the entire set at once and only parts of it would work. It took me hours to load up the data into MATLAB because there are a lot of intricacies with certain toolboxes and drivers, But I was able to simplify it tremendously in the class that I made. Another problem I ran into is that I kept running out of memory due to the size of the data so I had to try multiple times to find a good number that would work but is also high.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am really proud that I made an actually software that can do real analytics on big data sets which is very useful in the real world. I am also proud that I was able to learn so many new things in a relatively short period of time.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to use MySQL and load up data into other softwares such as MATLAB. Ilearned how to manage massive sets of data by analyzing it piece by piece. I also learned how to convert data into an audio file in MATLAB. Finally, I learned how to properly analyze data by using the database toolbox and the statistics toolboxes.</p>\n<h2>What's next for StockDataAnalyzer</h2>\n<p>I will probably try to do some more advanced analytics such as predicting future stock data based on the present.

Throughout the years, we found that we waste much time trying to find available study locations that suit our needs.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>StudySpotter is a dynamic web application that shows its users available study locations for a given time period. Users are able to search for available locations in our database or view all locations. We currently support coffee shops and bookstores in the Philadelphia area, classrooms in Levine Hall, and group study rooms in Van Pelt. When the user views the details of a location, it shows them the address, the available times, a picture of the location, and a map. Users can log in to provide updates on which locations are available at which times.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We build this web app using Bootstrap with jade and html5. We are hosting this site on a Linux server, on which we installed MongoDB and Node.js. We are using Node.js for networking and MongoDB to store our user information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge we ran into was configuring our local environment with Node.js and MongoDB for testing purposes. We originally ran the code on our machines (localhost) in order to test changes more quickly. The next challenge we had was deciding how we would host our website. We originally had planned on hosting it on Microsoft Azure, but after having challenges getting MongoDB to run on it we decided to abandon this idea and simply provision a Linux server from Linode and host our website there. The final challenge we had was getting our code to run on the Linux server. After FTPing our code, we found that we had to make some changes to the folder structure to get the website to display correctly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>One accomplishment of which we are proud is getting the web app hosted on the Linux server and running correctly. Not having much experience with Linux and hosting websites, my teammate and I overcame many challenges. Another accomplishment of which we are proud is developing a modern-looking website. We decided to use high-resolution pictures that took up the entire screen and large buttons to make the user interface more intuitive. We found that this not only tested our coding ability, but also our designing skills.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned much about coding in throughout this hackathon, and especially improved our front-end skills. We learned how to divide the workload in an efficient manner so that both team members can be contributing simultaneously to the project. We learned about website design, and how to draw mock-ups.</p>\n<h2>What's next for StudySpotter</h2>\n<p>We plan on integrating other functionality into our web app. Some examples include adding support for OpenID logins such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft for users who are more comfortable logging into those platforms rather than our system. We also plan on integrating Uber functionality for users to request rides to study locations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/grunt-js\">grunt.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["EyMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CkXdsEfPuA?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EyMe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/724/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EyMe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/717/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EyMe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/718/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"EyMe \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/066/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We set out to create a fascinating visual art experience for the user. Our work was inspired by \u201cA Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style\u201d by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge. We hope the project will inspire the user to seek artwork in real life, but if they are unable, we have created a way for anyone to enrich their life with visual art through virtual reality. We want everyone to be able to experience an EverydaY MasterpiecE</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user enters a virtual reality environment where they can switch between original images and a version that has been manipulated. Using the algorithm created by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge, the user experiences the same image but translated into the style of a famous painting.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the algorithm created by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge which allowed us to transform pictures into different styles of art taken from masterpieces. We then developed a program to display these pictures in a personal experience. Specifically, we captured images using fisheye lenses and filters. We then ran the images through the algorithm to change them into the different art styles. Finally, we created a program to display these images in virtual reality with the Oculus Rift. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>At first, we could not even figure out how to hook up the Oculus Rift to the computer. We also had lots of difficulties adding our images to Unity and switching between them. For the non-photorealistic rendering, we based our method on a recent advancement in the literature of deep neural networks, and there is some demo code online that we used to render our images. However, making all the dependencies including caffe, torch, cutorch, and cudnn function correctly is not a trivial task given the limited amount of time that we had. As deep neural networks require a huge amount of computation, we tried use the Amazon Cloud Computing Service (AWS) to facilitate our computation. We were able to use the CPU to complete our rendering, but we were unable to successfully use the GPU to render at a faster pace.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to be using some of the latest technologies and especially a very recent advancement in non-photorealistic rendering using deep neural networks.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the importance of search engine optimization while creating our webpage.</p>\n<h2>What's next for EyMe</h2>\n<p>We would try to move towards a real time rendering. We could attach a camera to the front of the Oculus Rift so the world would be translated into art in real time. This would require huge improvements to the way the algorithm works and also to the hardware we would use for the rendering. This goal is very lofty, but there is one feasible step that could get us started.. We would try to use GPU computing through AWS instead of CPU, which would make great improvements to our rendering time. Another step would be to automate the entire process. Currently, it is tedious to manually submit each photo for rendering without a queue. By creating a queue and auto-retrieving results, lots of time could be saved.</p>\n<p><strong>Paintings used</strong>\n<em>The Starry Night</em> by Vincent van Gogh\n<em>Woman with a Hat</em> by Henri Matisse\n<em>A Wheatfield with Cypresses</em> by Vincent van Gogh</p>\n<p><em>Please note:</em>\nAs attributed above, the algorithm for the rendering came from \u201cA Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style\u201d by Gatys, Ecker, and Bethge.\nWe did not write our own code for the non-photorealistic rendering.

From hearing laughter in the office to detecting if a conference room is available, it can be programmed to suit the needs of any office. </p>\n<p>ENGAGES TEAM THROUGH SLACK\nUsing Slack's chat, COBI interacts with coworkers engaging, informing or just breaking the ice when needed. It can be programmed to compliment the culture of any company. From sending a big hello as soon as someone walks through the door, to sharing a fun cat GIF to react to the silence in the office, the possibilities are endless. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>COBI's brain runs on a SparkCore microcontroller.

Some people just don't know about these places and less bad things can happen to people if they were aware of this.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Be Wary provides a crowd-sourced map of all of the sketchy places in town, along with comments and ratings so that users can be aware of any unsafe places that they might wander into. And If they do wander around there, the app will alert them that they are heading near an unsavory area and will suggest another route to them. Users can also contribute to the effort and identify unsafe places in the app. This app gives many people the awareness that they would otherwise not have and help them avoid unfortunate things happen to them.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I build this with my friend Luis. It's an Android app the interacts with a Parse backend. The entire project is in Java. We used Google's Maps API to render maps and their Shapes API to mark areas that are be unsafe. We followed a lot of Google's material design guidelines so that the app could look as best it could - almost all UI elements come from google's design library.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a lot of problems with first hooking up to Google's API and wiring up the backend. In order to use Google's Location API (not maps), you need to register a client key and connect it. Figuring out this step took at least 3 hours of tinkering and hacking, but, with the help of a Facebook engineer, we were able to overcome that. We also has trouble with the backend - we tried using JDBC to connect directly to a MySQL database that sat on Microsoft's AZURE platform. We ran into problems because Android does not support JDBC, so it had scarce documentation and was very buggy. Even with the help of a Google Engineer, we had to switch platforms. We had already spent so much time setting everything up for mysql, so we had to quickly find a new platform. We settled on Parse because it was quick and we had resources to help us learn.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm very proud of the aesthetic design of the app as well as the code architecture. I feel that it is very well built, even though code for hackathon projects devolve quickly through the hackathon. Naming conventions were consistent, services were decoupled, views were separated from logic. It's better than any of my other hackathon projects. I'm also very proud of the design too. I don't consider myself a designer, but sometimes my interfaces look really good: this is one of those times. The colors and other design decisions I chose went seamlessly together and gives a very good user experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Be Wary</h2>\n<p>The next thing for Be Wary is adding a lot more and better animations. That will make the UX feel more complete. We also have to complete the backend - we will probably switch from Parse to our own Python API. We will look into submitting it to Code For Atlanta (the civic hacking group in Atlanta) and see if the members there would like to contribute and make the app better, faster. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ferrerluis/bewary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ferrerluis/bewary\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend creating the database \"schema\" and using Parse for communicating with cloud-based NoSQL database.", ""]], ["WhosThatPokemon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I made this because it is fun!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for WhosThatPokemon</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Call it Magic", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LstVUlx7dDw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Call it Magic \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/024/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Call it Magic \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/025/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Call it Magic \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/027/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Call it Magic \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/023/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Call it Magic \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/022/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Being a new college student, a team member of ours had just moved into a completely new place. When he ran out of shaving cream shortly after moving in he was stuck...Where might this person find shaving cream...today...before said person gives the impression of an unshaven, unclean engineer to all his new peers?</p>\n<p>We then realized that often times in life you just want something, but to get that something requires a lot of red tape. First you have to find where to go, get the address, search the ratings, check the inventory/menu/prices, etc. To solve this, we created Call It Magic.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Call It Magic is the world's first search engine for the world around you. Whenever you want something you can just start typing. As you start typing, the results list immediately populates with suggested items matching your query.  Let's say I want a burger. I would just type in \"burger\" and all of a sudden a list of burgers at every restaurant is at my finger tips\u2013\u2013with yelp ratings, prices, and distance info. I can just click on the one I want and then within one click order an uber to go there or get it delivered via postmates.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app consisted of two front end clients, iOS and Web, and then a backend. To get the data our backend scraped the websites of a multitude of online services and combined them into our own MongoDB database. Using Algolia we could then search this database to provide the most relevant results matching the user's query. From there, we used Google Maps on web and Apple Maps on iOS to provide mapping data and calculate distance to the establishment. We then used the Uber API and postmates to allow the user to instantly get either transportation to the business of interest or pay someone to pick the good up for them.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Call it Magic</h2>\n<p>Currently Call It Magic only has knowledge on the city of Philadelphia. The next major step would be to expand to more cities and take advantage of even more data sources available on the interwebs. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/algolia\">algolia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber\">uber</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postmates\">postmates</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.co</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://callitmagic.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://callitmagic.co/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>callitmagic.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jasonscharff/call_it_magic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jasonscharff/call_it_magic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jreinstra/magic-browser\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jreinstra/magic-browser\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the iPhone app.", "Made the web frontend.", ""]], ["HandsFree", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HandsFree \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/014/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HandsFree \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/016/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HandsFree \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/017/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HandsFree \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/066/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Over 250,000 people live with spinal cord injuries in the US. 47% of injuries are quadriplegic -- paralysis of all four limbs and torso.

Existing solutions entail a lot of friction, requiring manual steps to install updated builds of apps and hours or days of approval time for new builds.  When testing on a large fleet of devices, a solution that works instantly and completely invisibly in the background would be a huge improvement.  That's what we built with Slipstream.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Slipstream continually delivers updated app builds to enrolled iOS and Android devices.  As soon as a developer pushes a new commit to a designated git branch, the app is built automatically on an Azure cloud server.  A push notification is sent to all devices, which instantly install the new build of the app without any user interaction required.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Slipstream uses git and Jenkins to receive new commits and fire off builds for Android and iOS.  Once the app is built and all tests have passed, it uses Parse to send a push notification to the Slipstream updater on all enrolled iOS and Android devices.  The Slipstream updater seamlessly installs the new version of app within seconds, completely invisible to the user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>iOS is naturally a very locked-down environment.  Hours after the Android updater was working end-to-end, we were still struggling to get the iOS updater to achieve our stated goals.  Thanks to the help of fellow PennApps hacker and iOS expert Conrad Kramer, we were able to reverse-engineer a private, hidden API on iOS that did exactly what we wanted!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We believe this is the first truly automatic solution for continually updating apps on iOS outside of the App Store.  By leveraging private APIs - information that isn't available anywhere on the web - we can do what existing solutions can't.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Many behind-the-scenes tricks on iOS to make it do things it was never intended to do :)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Slipstream</h2>\n<p>We want to make Slipstream available to any team to eliminate the friction of updating apps on development and test devices.  This will involve writing clear and complete documentation and building out our web service to allow anyone to Slipstream their app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jenkins\">jenkins</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docker\">docker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/qcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/qcast\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on our backend API and Jenkins configuration to automatically build and send push notifications", "", ""]], ["SharedDx", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SharedDx \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/951/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SharedDx \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/953/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I am a radiology resident physician.  Traditional PowerPoint presentations are suboptimal for learning about X-ray, CT, and MRIs.  In a normal day, a lecture hall has 40 people but only 1 person can discuss the case shown on the projector screen.</p>\n<p>At scientific conferences the situation is worse - a lecture hall has hundreds of seats, so when the speaker asks the audience a question \"do you guys see anything wrong with this X-ray?  Where is the disease?\" There is no participation - the speaker has a laser pointer, the audience has nothing.</p>\n<p>The entire careers of radiologists and other imaging processionals rely on being able to communicate clearly using images.  I created SharedDx to allow real-time collaborative discussion about medical imaging both in a real-life conference setting and in a virtual conference (e.g. conference call).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>SharedDx allows a presenter to create a slide deck using medical images.</li>\n<li>Everyone in the audience can jump into the presentation slide using their phone/tablets and point at abnormalities and pose questions to the speaker through a chat window.<br/></li>\n<li>A QR code is made available so the audience can use QR scanner on their phone or tablet device to join the discussion.  The QR code can be dragged out of the way or hidden.</li>\n<li>A timer is available so the presenter can \"quiz\" the audience to log in and point at where the disease is before time runs out.</li>\n<li>A user can follow along with the speaker (if they are on the same slide together), or review the slides on their own from their mobile device (using the Next/Prev buttons).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>PHP is used to procedurally generate the code for each slide based on XML input (which uses customized tags like ).  JavaScript/JQuery/HTML5 for the front-end.  And the collaboration is enabled by TogetherJS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I am not a professional programmer so this is all pretty difficult, but I did learn a great deal in the process.  </p>\n<p>TogetherJS was easy to use but doesn't synchronize the slides for the different users.  It was difficult to tweak the behavior just right.  I needed the speaker to have 100% control of her own screen (wouldn't that be disastrous if you're giving a medical talk and your slides jumped around because the audience is messing with you!).  However, I also wanted the audience's screen to synchronize with the speaker's when she advances the slides.  This means being able to tease out who is the creator, who are the participants, and how to synchronize inputs from different screens.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I have never created anything that supported multiple simultaneous users.  TogetherJS is very easy to use, but the devil was in the details.  I am proud of being able to achieve the behavior I needed in synchronizing between multiple users.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>For the hackathon I decided functionality / and prototyping were more important than keeping a disciplined code design.  But then I quickly learned that PHP and HTML is very - very - messy... if you don't diligently clean up the code as you go, everything sort of mesh together into a mix of PHP/HTML/JavaScript.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for SharedDx</h2>\n<p>The presentation creation process should be easy,  just drag some educational medical images to upload them, then drag the uploaded images to arrange for the order and be done.  </p>\n<p>Also, ShareDx should support PowerPoint (even if it means just converting all the slides to JPG on server-side), so doctors can make their existing PPT slide decks collaborative without doing extra work.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">togetherjs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">qrcode.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.shareddx.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.shareddx.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.shareddx.co</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.github.com/howardpchen/shareddx\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.github.com/howardpchen/shareddx\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["CardMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CardMe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/848/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CardMe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/853/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CardMe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/855/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To be honest, the \"minors\" on our team wanted an app that would allow them to determine which bars card, so they could avoid those and go to the ones that don't. But then we realized- if we flip this problem around, there's a tremendous opportunity for us to use this same principle to affect real change, and have a tangible social impact. It's near impossible for police officers to effectively patrol alcohol distribution to minors, and hiring agents to pose as minors can be extremely costly. But we, as a crowd, can solve this problem. We can help bring the number of young people that die every year from underage drinking from 5,000 to zero. By crowdsourcing this data collection, and incentivizing people to participate in the process, we can put together the dataset that we so desperately need-- one which tells us which establishments are upholding the law when it comes to serving minors, and which ones aren't. And once we have that information, we can create better policy, think critically about which businesses we support, and bring an end to this problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Three steps:\n1) You go to a bar. You open up the app, and a yes or no question pops up. Did you get carded, or not? Your response becomes a datapoint in our growing crowdsourced database.\n2) We display the percentage of people who have gotten carded at this establishment. Based on this outcome, you, as a consumer, can inform your decisions about which establishments you choose to support. Communities can hold bars and restaurants responsible for upholding the law, and boycott those that do not. \n3) You receive a coupon code as a reward for your contribution. Use this by the end of the night for 10% off of your drinks!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the following technologies to build our webapp: JavaScript, JQuery, HTML5, and CSS3. We depended on the Yelp API to provide us information about which bar we're currently standing in, and experimented with FireBase for our database (we ended up building our own data structure instead, since we felt it would meet our needs more efficiently). </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Turns out that Github won't allow for oauth. We needed to upload to a different server in order to get the location services to work. Also, FireBase ended up not meeting our needs in the way that we had hoped, so as we mentioned above, we decided to opt for a homegrown data structure instead. Lastly, given more time, we would have loved to dedicate more time to data analysis and data visualization capacities. We felt strongly that this would be the most powerful element of the application, but time didn't allow for us to pursue these capacities. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were extremely successful in our use of GitHub to effectively collaborate and exercise version control. Also, we successfully integrated Yelp, which was an exciting accomplishment after we struggled with the API for a long time. Finally, we were really happy with the pain point we identified, and the solution we identified. It successfully integrated our interests and strengths, and allowed us to develop skills we were excited about. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our process was heavily pitch-driven, which was a new way for us to develop. We began the process by creating and practicing our pitch, and came back to that pitch periodically over the course of the hackathon to make sure that we were developing the features that we had initially envisioned. Approaching our development process in this way allowed us to focus, and to exercise vision and effective goal setting. </p>\n<h2>What's next for CardMe</h2>\n<p>Capacity for data analysis. So far, we've developed the user-facing side of the app. We're excited to build the capacity for policy makers and law enforcement officers to extract datasets from the app, and perform analyses on trends and patterns which they observe in the dataset. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.card-me.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.card-me.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.card-me.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked full-stack on this project.

I used the Myo motion sensor's rotation capabilities to control your user's Pong platform against an unbeatable AI, and your job is to not die.

The most important aspect of this project was geospatial indexing, a feature of MongoDB which allowed for proximity-based calculations to be made. The only geospatial feature for which another resource had been used was for geocoding-- i.e., retreiving the initial latitude and longitude coordinates from the user's input. For this I used the OpenCage Geocoder API through Python's GeoPy client.</p>\n<p>Visualization was done primarily through Folium, a python package which allows python data to be visualized using Leaflet.js.</p>\n<p>Future improvements in mind include bike-path expansion using bike-path datasets provided (currently there are minimal bikepaths shown in proximity), additional nodes such as parks in proximity to markets or bike stations, shortest-path bike travel. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JoshuaDownes/PennAppsHealthyRouter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JoshuaDownes/PennAppsHealthyRouter\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["ProtectPhilly", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>We were very attracted to the idea of creating a civic hack during this hackathon, especially when we heard about the vast amount of data recently made available by the Philadelphia government. As students at the University of Pennsylvania, we wanted to find a way that our work this weekend could have a positive impact on the community we live in. One problem we were aware of is the high prevalence of HIV in the city of Philadelphia. That's how we decided to create an Android app to help connect people with HIV prevention and treatment options. One portion of our app helps users find the nearest faculty that provides free condoms, which are very effective in preventing HIV. Another directs them towards the HIV treatment facilities that are closest to them. Finally, the app has a small informational section to promote awareness about the prevalence of HIV in Philadelphia, and about the virus itself. While developing this app, we ran into challenges regarding the Google maps API, asynchronous tasks, and app design using Android studio. However, we were able to learn a lot about each of these topics, as well as JSON parsing, and the basics of Android App development along the way, and overcame the challenges we initially faced. We are proud of having integrated the Google Maps API to bring the city's data relating to HIV prevention to life. Next steps for our app include adding more of the design elements that we have planned, such as better transitions, more individualized graphics, and a more intuitive user experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://share.framerjs.com/1xmw3xusnjr1/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://share.framerjs.com/1xmw3xusnjr1/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>share.framerjs.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Grandmahjong", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We play mahjong but are all in different places! </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We can play mahjong online connecting with our friends from anywhere in the world! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://grandmahjong.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://grandmahjong.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>grandmahjong.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["TravelSafe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGUiADditRE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TravelSafe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/142/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TravelSafe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/144/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"TravelSafe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/285/145/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of death among all age groups in this country.

Although I use it often, I regularly see myself complaining about how unwieldy it can be, especially on mobile devices and with attempting to create non-textual notes. Hedgehog aims to provide most of the same functionality as Evernote but in a heavily streamlined UI/UX package that is heavily influenced by Snapchat.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hedgehog is designed to streamline the personal note-taking process into a sleek and efficient process.

It utilizes the Android Support Libraries in order to maintain as much compatibility as possible to previous Android releases while also providing a modern user experience.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>My primary challenge was getting the Camera to work properly. Hedgehog was the first Android project in which I've interacted with the Camera and thus, it took me some time for me to get it working to a point that I'm fairly happy with (I rewrote the camera fragment approximately five times throughout Saturday). I'd also planned to add support for video recording and playback, but unfortunately, it was for more complex and time-consuming that I had anticipated.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Although I wasn't able to achieve all my goals for Hedgehog that I'd planned to implement during PennApps, I'm satisfied with the amount of work I <em>was</em> able to do especially given the fact that this project far surpasses anything else I've done in the realm of mobile development.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>For one thing, I've learned that mobile development is far harder and challenging than most people believe it to be. I also learned about the Android camera APIs and their intricacies.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hedgehog</h2>\n<p>Although in it's current state, Hedgehog is extremely <em>hacky</em>, I firmly believe it has a market potential. Thus, I will be continuing to develop and expand it in the future. My current plans are to add cloud synchronization, video notes (which I attempted, and failed, to add during PennApps), note sharing, and several other small and large features. I may even write iOS and web clients at some point in the future.</p>\n<h2>Bonus: Why is it named Hedgehog</h2>\n<p>Because hedgehogs are super cute... And because it was the first thing that came to my mind when I was figuring out a name for the project. Plus they're super cute!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">android-support-library</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Sole creator and developer"]], ["4000 Weeks", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4000 Weeks \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/794/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4000 Weeks \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/795/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4000 Weeks \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/796/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>80 years is about 4000 weeks.

It's a great idea in concept - Twitter is a real-time unfiltered look into the psyche of its users - and should be perfect for the task. There are entire services built around the concept [<a href=\"http://stocktwits.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stocktwits.com/</a>]. The large number of people trying to mine information from Twitter has actually added volatility to the market. If the official account of say, George Soros, tweets that Coca Cola is overvalued, shares will be hit instantly as HFT algorithms pounce on the information. This process is inherently volatile. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project is an easily deployable stealth twitter bot designed in Python that attempts to <strong>reduce market volatility</strong> by influencing sentiment towards the mean. It is designed to run 24/7 and has a simple schedule. During non-trading / business hours the bot favorites and retweets posts by influential financial figures and institutions to try and accumulate credibility/influence. During pre-trading hours the bot tweets at these same figures/institutions the exact opposite of the movement from the previous day. I.e. if the Dow-Jones increased by 4% market, the bot will tweet that there is going to be a steep correction and that we're going to enter a bear market. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The entirety of the bot is built in <strong>Python</strong>. Market data accessed through <strong>Quandl's</strong> open API and processed with <strong>Numpy</strong>. We used <strong>Tweepy</strong> as a fast way to handle authentication and request generation for Twitter's API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The major challenge is establishing credibility for an account that is clearly fake. The process of slowly favoriting and retweeting over time is meant to somewhat mirror human behavior. The inherent randomness also might help fool spam filters. The other challenge was working within the request limits that both the Twitter and Quandl APIs used. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning how to work with Twitter's API, especially the OAuth2 protocol was very gratifying. Also learning how about event scheduling in Python was really cool.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Scheduling events in time-sensitive code completely changes the way you have to design applications. </p>\n<h2>What's next for StrattonOakmont</h2>\n<p>The sky is the limit for StrattonOakmont. We will continue to improve our bot in order to eliminate the scourge of market volatility once and for all. Perhaps a bot network is the next step. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/goodmattg/StrattonOakmont\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/goodmattg/StrattonOakmont\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Twitch Collaboration Based VR Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_voaCJqpFA?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to experiment with the idea of Twitch Plays.

Samulnori is a genre of Traditional Korean music that almost every Korean knows. Many of my friends are participating in PennDure, a Samulnori Performing Troupe at Penn, and every time they perform, lots of Korean elders around Pennsylvania area travel from long distances to listen to the music. But the biggest restriction of Samulnori is that the instruments have extremely piercing sound, and that they are hard to carry. I started from there, thinking of a mobile application in which users can play Samulnori. However, looking through the applications in the AppStore, I found out that there exists a lot of mixing tools for Western instruments, but very few exists for the Eastern instruments. If you could loop through all four instruments and record your playings, I thought it would not only be more enjoyable for not only Korean users but also become a nice introduction to Eastern music and Korean Culture for non-Koreans. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users can create loops of records with a name, speed, and length of they want. Each loop has audio files of four instruments - Small Gong, Drum, Two Head Drum, and Gong. Users can record their music by clicking a red button at the top right corner of the screen of each instrument. They can listen to the mixed file of all of the recordings in the loop after recording.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used STK library to read raw audio files into the application. After reading in the files, I used TheAmazingAudioEngine library in order to put those sounds into the channel and produce sound. Then, I first built individual instrument objects which act like an actual instrument. After making each instrument, I then created a looper, using TheAmazingAudioEngine library. Lastly, I used EZAudio library in order to draw the wave forms of your recording onto the screen.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Since Swift was introduced only a year ago, all of those libraries that I used were not in Swift. Hardest part of the project that took me most of the time was to use combination of ObjC, Swift, and even C++ in appropriate times and make it work as an one application. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud that I could implement simple yet intuitive design. I had hard time deciding which color to use for the instruments. I figured it out by using some of the colors that are called \"ObangGanSack,\" which are eight colors that Koreans had been using often from the past. It includes, white, black, blue, yellow, red, grey, green, and light pink. I am also proud that I could do everything from gathering all the library resources, to implementing  the application design by myself. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to organize the procedure of developing project by listing things that I should be implementing. That way, it was easier to track time and my progress. I also learned how to use different libraries in an appropriate places. It was the first time I worked with multiple libraries, and it was hard to decide which library should I use, since there are so many libraries that have similar functions. After failing in using few, I could finally find the one that would work. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Dangrang</h2>\n<p>I would implement a feature that allows the users to download the files that they recorded, and share it with other people through Cloud. I also hope to make a tutorial inside an application where users who are not so familiar with Korean Music can learn some Korean beats and basic information about Samulnori.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">theamazingaudioengine</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ezaudio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stk</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Tutspot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tutspot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/765/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tutspot \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/805/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tutspot \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/806/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tutspot \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/809/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tutspot \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/810/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tutspot \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/811/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>@Contributors \nVuk Petrovic, Gin Zukas, Raymond Jackson, John You</p>\n<p>A community driven development tutorial website.

The Pebble watch seemed like a good fit that didn't require electrical knowledge while pushing us out of the comfort zones of the technologies we usually work with. We brainstormed some ideas and Watchdog seemed promising, as it was an original design that had the potential to help people.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Watchdog causes the Pebble to vibrate periodically (barking) when it detects that potential trauma has happened due to a fall. In the event of a false positive, Watchdog can be easily disarmed by pressing any button on the watch, or by shaking it around in case the other hand isn't free. If the wearer does need help, they don't have to do anything - in the worst cases, they often cannot. This is where Watchdog shines. By automatically notifying (from a trusted contact or emergency services via Twilio, and giving their coordinates along with an approximate address through the Bing Maps API) without any interaction on the wearer's part, Watchdog ensures that the user will never be caught helpless and alone.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Neither team member had any experience with Pebble, wearables, or even hackathons. We built it learning new things while putting various productive software engineering technologies, such as Git and Emacs to use. Lots of Google and patience also helped. We set up a Flask web server that PebbleKit (the JavaScript integrated with Pebble) sends XMLHttpRequests to, and the server does the messaging using the Twilio API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Working around the limitations of the Pebble, while figuring out just what those limitations were. For example, Pebble officially supports both JavaScript and C but the JavaScript functionality is very limited, as it doesn't actually run on the watch itself. We also had some trouble finding a good host to deploy our web server on.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Watchdog's mechanism is among the most proactive life-protecting system around, and it provides that protection without being a burden on the wearer. Specialized hardware exists, but no one wants to have to carry around something that does nothing but burden them until their life is in serious trouble. Because Watchdog is built of top of the Pebble platform, it's out of your way and you get to carry around a cool smartwatch with you.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to integrate a wide array of technologies in Watchdog. We tried multiple deployment servers, hopped between languages, and integrated numerous APIs to make the app. The biggest takeaway from this is that there is nothing that can't be learned, and the things we learn will only help us more in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Watchdog</h2>\n<p>If there is a market for this then we would love to try to make it work. The algorithms can be refined and the concept can be expanded to other wearables.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://watchdog.mybluemix.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://watchdog.mybluemix.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>watchdog.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nivekuil/watchdog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nivekuil/watchdog\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["lexi", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"lexi \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/662/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"lexi \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/286/667/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to make language-learning faster, more omnipresent, and a less burdensome process, so we built lexi to automate the web for you so you can focus on your everyday internet use instead of the barriers to language learning. \nThe English lexicon is different for everyone. We aimed to provide a novel and efficient personalized language-learning for anyone browsing the Internet. That meant providing an application for both experienced and new English speakers alike, and not getting in the way of your normal browsing experience. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>lexi knows the words you don\u2019t. It instantly turns your daily Internet browsing into a personalized language-learning experience. It doesn\u2019t matter if you already speak English or not: lexi will calibrate to the words you need.</p>\n<p>lexi works by highlighting the words on a webpage that it thinks you don\u2019t know and then providing synonyms on the page in unobtrusive parentheses. It provides a sliding scale to instantly adjust both the words it predicts and your proficiency level.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The back-end of lexi runs on a blazing-fast Microsoft Azure server, with Node.js set up to provide optimal performance. Word difficulties, synonyms, and definitions are retrieved from a third-party service using an API we built and are then cached both locally and on our server to ensure high performance and availability, even in the face of a potential third-party outage. This API is then utilised by a Google Chrome extension which compares the words on the user\u2019s web page to the user\u2019s personal difficulty level to determine which words will require clarification and inserts helpful synonyms in parentheses. We further boost performance by filtering each request to avoid re-fetching words that have already been cached in Chrome local storage.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Scraping all the plaintext from the DOM of an arbitrary website proved to be quite difficult. Every website is unique in its design, but we still managed to build a robust parser from the ground up to handle this challenge.</p>\n<p>Another significant challenge was improving lexi\u2019s speed to the point where users could seamlessly integrate lexi into their reading experience. </p>\n<p>Finally, we found that there was a lack of API\u2019s for analyzing word difficulty level. To compensate for this gap, we ended up building our own system to retrieve difficulty ratings from a live website and provide them in an easy-to-parse format.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating our own api for our lexical queries. </p>\n<p>Building a fast backend that takes advantage of parallelism and caching.</p>\n<p>Optimizing our algorithm to extract plaintext from an arbitrary website through applying techniques like binary search.</p>\n<p>Scalable and modular software design</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Parsing of complex website structures to allow seamlessly inserting and removing content without breaking the page</p>\n<p>Caching both local and server-side to improve performance.</p>\n<p>Building chrome extensions </p>\n<h2>What's next for lexi</h2>\n<p>In the next version, lexi will seamlessly handle translations between multiple languages, to help people who are learning a foreign language other than English. We will also continue working to make lexi more accurate, more responsive, and more predictive. This may be done by computing our own difficulty ratings for words by analyzing word frequencies on Wikipedia and other common domains, as well as aggregate reading patterns for lexi users. Furthermore, we will give users the ability to provide feedback to lexi, training lexi to be even more personalized and accurate.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/erkyz/lexicon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/erkyz/lexicon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/apjaffe/DictionaryAPI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/apjaffe/DictionaryAPI\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Contextshoel", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Contextshoel \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/682/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Tracking and monitoring data indeed gives some interesting results, and this basically leads up to the Quantified Self.

What if you knew exactly what you can order in a restaurant at just a tap of your cell phone. Since restaurants are increasingly turning to tablets to share their menus with users, it is the right time for consumers to make full use of this to make quick, informed and safe decision about their next meal.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The project is a set of 2 android apps. One built to be used by the restaurants and other to be used by the users.The restaurant version of the app is the one where the restaurant will enter the menu items and ingredients of every item.\nThe user version of the app will be present on the user's device and the user just has to tap the device on the restaurant's device and menu will be transferred to the user's device and all the items that the user is allergic to will be removed from the menu and a customized version of menu will be displayed on user's device. This makes choosing the next meal a lot simpler, easier and safer.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Epic apis to get patient information and also to get allergic information for that patient. On first install of the app, the user is asked details about himself; the details include FirstName, Given Name, Address, Gender, Telephone Number ad BirthDate. These fields are used to fetch the user's unique id which is then used to fetch the allergic information for the user.\nThe user app is independent of the restaurant app, thus the app will work with every restaurant which can provide the information in a particular format.\nThe android apps currently exchange data(menu) using NFC. Since the user's information never leaves the user's cellphone, their is no risk of information leakage.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>All of the team members had little experience developing android applications, thus there were a lot of stumbling blocks on the way. Those were mainly centered around NFC.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to address a fairly common problem using means readily available to the users. Additionally,We were able to build a working  set of proof-of-concept android apps in about 30 hours while gaining valuable experience and insights into how applications are developed.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the kind of data available in healthcare domain.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Customiz Menus</h2>\n<p>We plan to extend the application to include Bar Codes scanning, which will enable a user to scan any product and verify if the ingredients of that product are safe for his consumption.\nAdditionally, the app can be extended to included dislikes/preferences and not just allergies to make the menu even more customized to your preferences.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/epic\">epic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/arpitpanwar/CustomizeMenu.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/arpitpanwar/CustomizeMenu.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on building the back-end business logic and design ofthe user app.\nAdditionally I also worked on building the user interface", "I worked on the NFC feature to transfer data from the tablet to the phone.

Recently, control systems like the Microsoft Kinect have become increasingly popular, which inspired me to create a small-scale alternate control method for Minecraft.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WatchCraft replaces keyboard and mouse input in Minecraft with a combination of a Leap Motion hand position and tilt tracking system, and a Pebble Time acting as extra input and a second screen.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used pebble.js to build the watchapp, because of its WebSocket support. I used Python to interface with the Pebble and the Leap Motion, and to control Minecraft.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>While I was able to replicate most of the Minecraft controls required for feasible gameplay, the way that Minecraft handles mouse movement prevented me from implementing camera controls in this version of WatchCraft. </p>\n<p>Designing the interaction with the smartwatch was also a challenge, as I really had to balance the amount of smartwatch interaction with the amount of gesture control I was implementing.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was my first experience with smartwatch applications, so I gained quite a bit of experience working with embedded systems.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WatchCraft</h2>\n<p>While WatchCraft was first and foremost a thought experiment on alternative interfaces, it could potentially be developed into a way for people with RSI (Repetitive Strain Injury) to enjoy Minecraft, as its gesture-based interface requires less of the motion associated with the injury. The code can also be easily modified to support other keyboard-and-mouse games (such as Portal and Portal 2), which may provide opportunities for further development. The code for the project is open source (under the MIT license), so many adaptations of this concept are also possible.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">minecraft</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/technoboy10/WatchCraft\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/technoboy10/WatchCraft\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did all of the project myself, with some advice from friends on other teams."]], ["EazyFair", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Found myself at a career fair with over 100 of companies and a list of the ones I wanted to see.

While I am there, I want to be able to learn what things are on the fly, without having to type anything in and deciphering what it is in English first.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Captura</strong> allows you to take a picture of anything and then, by image processing, deciphers what it is and gives you either the English, Spanish, German, or French phrase, pronunciation, and spelling. As you take more and more photos and learn more and more words, you develop your own dictionary of pictures associated to phrases that you can reflect on and learn from.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used the Clarifai API to help with image processing, the Microsoft-Translate API to convert the Clarifai output to multiple languages, the Voice-RSS API to then pronounce the word, and I chose to use Java Maven with Apache Tomcat, because it was universal between the two APIs. I also used Firebase for the backend to handle logins and user information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Setting up Maven was very challenging. I had only briefly used it before, and so a majority of my time was dedicated to learning the ins and outs of Maven. PhoneGap for Maven also proved to be a challenge because I did not have all of the Apple Developer requirements established. I really wanted to get the web app done first so that way I had the logic established before I dove into mobile, however I ran out of time towards the end. As a compromise, I ended up making my app mobile compatible. I also could not figure out how to assign a proper domain to my maven project, so I had to run it on my localhost to test. Along with that, I initially spent the first night trying to set up my own database. By the wee hours of the morning on Saturday I chose to scratch that idea and just use Firebase. I decided to go with Firebase over Parse or MongoDB because I had used it before and I wanted to save time since I was learning so many new APIs and languages. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to create an application I will actually use while I am abroad!

Context switching between what is currently on your screen and any sort of organizational app is distracting and time consuming (think about accidentally flying three desktops over!). Often the distraction of noting down future plans is more than that of the text or phone call that notified you of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Lookout</strong> is a <em>lightweight</em> app that combines Notes and Calendar for rapid access to the most pertinent information in a glance. It provides three scratchpads to drop idle thoughts and to-dos in a snap, titling each one of them like the Notes app by taking the first two words of the note. It also provides three quick views of your calendar: two days, two weeks, and two months, displaying only non recurring events to cull out some of the noise and bring focus to the out of the ordinary. Because it lives in the status bar, it is accessible from all desktops and full-screened applications, and therefore lightning fast to both pull up and tuck away.</p>\n<h2>Additional Features</h2>\n<p>The rich text format of the scratchpads can be exported as RTF files for convenience. It also saves the scratchpads to an intermediary file, in case of unexpected system crashes or other unexpected issues. Because of the light-weight, glance-like nature of Lookout, rather than allowing calendar events to be added in the app, command and click to open Calendar for extended interaction.</p>\n<h2>Please <a href=\"https://github.com/leejcw/Lookout\" rel=\"nofollow\">download</a> and try it out!</h2>\n<h2>Special Thanks</h2>\n<p>I would like to extend my thanks to the Apple engineers who critiqued the UI and usability of my app as I worked. It was important for me that my app was aesthetically pleasing and made sense to others as well, so that it would not be a tool that only I could take advantage of.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/leejcw/Lookout/archive/master.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/leejcw/Lookout/archive/master.zip\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["This was a weekend project that I wanted to create for myself, and could think of no better time to do it at this semiannual event.

This ubiquitous issue of individuals not being able to put their children or themselves through a decent education, not being able to eat a nutritious meal, not being able to afford healthcare, and other similar problems really worried us about where society is headed. We weren't only worried about these worldwide problems, however. Many people struggle with saving money and we wanted to come up with a way to facilitate the process.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Some of them think that there is nothing that they can do in order to end the continuous cycle of living check to check, but there is a solution! BudgetBank aggregates all of the bank accounts and credit card accounts that an individual has and provides the user with important information that helps them easily view their spending habits. By using this app, the user can enter in a goal of how much money he or she wants to save each month. Having a physical amount that an individual want to save lets him or her make smart decisions about what should or should not be bought. Many people lose track of what was bought during each month, but by having BudgetBank automatically track financial information makes the process of tracking money so much easier, which of course, this results in saving money without lifting a finger..</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Swift to build the front-end design of the iOS application. Using the Plaid API allowed us to aggregate a bunch of financial information to ultimately build the easiest budgeting app there is. To make the user's spending habits easily viewable, we used an external iOS-charts library developed by Daniel Cohen Gindi. This library provides an extremely aesthetically pleasing interface to help users make smart decisions as to what to buy or what not to buy. We also used Microsoft Azure to create a SQL database to hold the data that Plaid provided for us. By using this powerful tool, we are able to easily pull information and give real time data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>A challenge that we ran into was trying to integrate the SQL server with iOS. Because this was our first times creating a database between Microsoft and iOS, we learned about Xamarin a little too late to be able to implement it. We had problems trying to use code (instead of simply viewing it through Microsoft SQL Server) to read the data from the SQL database. Another challenge that we ran into was parsing the data obtained by the Plaid API, specifically the multi-factor authentication. Because each bank has a unique authentication model, parsing the data was quite challenging. Creating models for aesthetic visualization was also quite difficult with iOS.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>An accomplishment that we are proud of is actually creating a product that can help people save money so that they can end up using it for something important. Another accomplishment that we are proud of is successfully using many different types of technologies to make an app that can help others with common issues. We have never used these specific technologies and APIs together and felt we did a good job implementing everything.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about the different technologies that we used. We also learned a lot about databases and how to create and integrate one into an iOS application. We picked up the skill of thinking creatively as well.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BudgetBank</h2>\n<p>We hope BudgetBank will be used throughout the world, in hopes of helping people budget their money wisely. We only used the dummy data provided by the companies at the hackathon and would like BudgetBank to start working with actual companies to provide real information to its users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">plaid-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/markhua/Budget-Manager\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.github.com/markhua/Budget-Manager\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Black Scholes Options Pricing Calculator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Black Scholes Options Pricing Calculator \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/284/531/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Options trading or derivative trading gives the right but not the obligation to exercise on an equity currently trading in the market. Investors world wide using options to hedge their positions against market volatility and also capitalize on possible stock devaluation. Options trading has being a huge revenue generating product in the financial industry. However, individual investors who doesn't have a big financial background may not have a good understanding in options. As a result they may miss opportunities to increase their portfolio value. Investors gets to buy or sell and option in the market. Since options are derivatives of equities, they are priced using different mathematical models. Our application gives the individual investor without much options trading background to price their options or to compare premium prices when they are buying an option in the open market. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It gets the current stock price and 2 years worth of market data.

Option could be either call or put option. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>using markitondemand api we gets the current stock price and 2 year worth of history data for any ticker. We use highstocks.js open source library to parse the api data and generate an interactive plot. This plot allows user to interact with the data. WE custom designed a back end web server using TCL. The idea of a custom web server is to optimize the api calls by doing to get the latest stock price on a even on a high frequency trading day. TCL is used widely in the world wide web as a simple, easy to set up end points and can run in one file. Which gives the opportunity to the develoer to tweak the server and easy to debug. Jquery is used in the client side to make continuous ajax calls to the server. In this app user gets the opportunity to adjust parameters and gets the premium price on real time. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The most serious bug was a formatting issue that arose when transferring data from the server to the client. The data was in the form of a JSON object returned by a third party API serving historical stock pricing data. The backend server is written in Tcl, and Tcl\u2019s treatment of strings caused some confusion in terms of where braces were supposed to be present. At first it wasn\u2019t obvious this was the source of the bug. The client wasn\u2019t receiving enough data for meaningful debugging messages. After assuring myself the backend was receiving the correct data, I was able to tweak and hard-code some output into a format the client would accept. I worked backwards from this point until I had reconciled the issue and figured out where the bad formatting was taking place. In the end, it was Tcl\u2019s treatment of strings that caused the issue, but also made it trivial to fix. Tcl does not discriminate between code and data, and thus provides excellent mechanisms for handling situation involving complex escaping. Despite this issue taking several hours to pinpoint, I think using Tcl on the backend was an overall gain in terms of productivity because it lays bare all implementation details; there are no magic underscores or restricting types to deal with; I spent surprisingly little time worrying about the backend apart from this bug.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to give a valuable opportunity to individual small scale investors to use option pricing models used by large investment banks for free. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>nothing is impossible </p>\n<h2>What's next for Black Scholes Options Pricing Calculator</h2>\n<p>Adding a feature to contact brokers to execute derivatives </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tcl</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mroll/pennapps.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mroll/pennapps.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did front-end development on the website, creating the web page using html, css, js (jQuery, and ajax).

Not only that, only 200 requests can be made per hour, meaning, only a total of 6000 individual tweets could be harvested within an hour, making large-scale harvesting of data difficult. We chose the S&amp;P 500 index since this indice contains a good variety of large-cap U.S. equities and aggregates them. Since only allowing to harvest minimal number of indexes at a time due to API limitation, choosing S&amp;P 500 was obvious. </p>\n<p>Next, IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer API requires a self-hosted Node.js application.

The pebble app also allows you to respond to these messages also using morse code (and the 3 side buttons), which is translated back into words by the other user's android phone. The pebble app has 2 modes, one which displays the messages as text on the screen, and the other which appears as a clock, giving the appearance that you aren't receiving messages at all. Both modes vibrate the messages through morse code, meaning reading them off the screen is optional.</p>\n<p>The android app allows the user to type a message to be sent to the connected pebble, and also shows a transcript of the conversation so far. It also allows the user to activate the pebble app remotely to begin sending messages immediately.</p>\n<h2>Controls</h2>\n<p>The top button places a dot (or 'dit'), the bottom button places a dash (or 'dah'), and the center button sets the current set of dashes and dots as the next letter (it also automatically does this after 4 button presses since morse code has max 4 symbols per letter). Double clicking the top button finishes the current letter and sends the previously completed letters to the paired cellphone. Triple clicking the middle button switches between reading mode and clock mode.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Android Studio and PebbleCloud, testing on a real pebble.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I was originally going to provide the ability to tap the pebble for morse code input, but wasn't satisfied with the accuracy.

These commands are interpreted by the Python node to invoke the appropriate C++ functions to control the robot. We have tested out the app with a quadrotor at the GRASP Lab at UPenn (see video above). Credits to the robot control stack go to developers at <a href=\"http://www.kumarrobotics.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multi-Robot Systems Lab</a>.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Watch Me Robot</h2>\n<p>We are looking to adding more functionality to the app itself, especially the accelerometer, as well as making a more user-friendly and appealing interface.
