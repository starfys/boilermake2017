Some of the weather conditions being monitored include temperature, humidity, wind direction and speed. Soil PH and water content level are also monitored to ensure an enabling environment for plants production. In the case of animal production, PH level of the aquaculture is monitored for fish production.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This application is a java desktop application with a robust database containing data-set of climate weather condition for crops and animals. The integration of the desktop application and the hardware part is also carried out. Hardware section consists of a micro-controller and sensors. Assembly language is also used for the micro-controller programming.</p>\n<h2>Challenges in development</h2>\n<p>The main challenge that will be encountered in developing the system is that of the finance for the procurement of the relevant sensors.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team we are able to come up with a partially working system which when given time to revamp the software will be full working application and ready for implementation</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We are able to learn the advantage of teamwork and the synergy it aids us to come up with this wonderful idea </p>\n<h2>What's next for AgroSmartGuide</h2>\n<p>To be fully designed and implemented........</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microcontroller</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sensors</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Nextgreengen", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Nextgreengen \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/446/891/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>we were inspired by how farmers are suffering, so we decided to initiate and come out with a solution to their challenges</p>\n<h2>What it does provide</h2>\n<p>it provide  value creation and mechanisation simple</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>through innovative technology and management</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>a team with strong passion and love for both ICT and Agriculture and the next challenge is funding which is another big challenge</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>with  the help of arewastartup we now have people we share common interest that we agree to move together</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Business model and introduction to Aquaculture</p>\n<h2>What's next for Nextgreengen</h2>\n<p>to have guide from arewastarup to go to the next level</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Yes I made some words contribution by given ideas in rural development area, and I made recommendation on how to improved agriculture in  rural areas by accessing d farmers in their Areas by introducing the new system of information technology in farming in the world.
