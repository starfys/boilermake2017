[["Codiggity", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It was agreed upon that we all had a passion for music, as well as the creative process behind it. Since we are a beginner team, we did not set our hopes particularly high. We settled on creating something which would both satisfy us and hopefully make people laugh. We believe we have accomplished this.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Codiggity is a rap generating machine. The user enters in a word, which starts the rhyming sequence, and an automated voice raps the lyrics in sync with the music. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Codiggity using C# in Visual Studio and MonoDevelop.  We ask the user to input a noun and that noun is used as the last word in the first sentence.  After that we use rhymebrain's API to find a word that rhymes with the noun the user entered.  After that we generate random nouns for the end of sentences and maintain an AABB CCDD EEFF GG rhyme scheme.  Also to generate words that rhyme we have to guarantee that the word is a noun so we use <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dictionary.reference.com/</a> to ensure it's a noun.  Then we used Microsoft's\u00a0speech synthesizer to make the computer read the rap, and finished it off with some Garageband beats and our very own logo.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our first issue of many was that one of our laptops simply would not connect to internet for twelve hours, so our programmers had to use a USB to pass code back and forth. Around midnight this magically fixed itself though, so things became easier. Our second issue, resolved about an hour ago, was that our one Windows laptop(the laptop which would best run the program) has terrible speakers. Because it is an auditory program, it is important that everyone can hear the straight fire Codiggity is able to create. There were no speakers in the hardware booth, so we ended up working as a team for close to two hours solving one of the Bloomberg puzzles in order to win a bluetooth speaker. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the way we handled our challenges(particularly the puzzle), as well as the way we went about the creative process. Also, we are proud of our efforts to navigate sentence structure.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The main lesson learned is that fun is the best motivator. Projects motivated by the need to laugh and remain in awe of what we have created are always the easiest to complete. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Codiggity</h2>\n<p>Codiggity will continue to be refined until it is perfect. We(the team behind the musical genius), will then exploit Codiggity to become famous rappers. With our riches, we will build an even bigger and better Codiggity, and become the best rappers known to man.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c-sharp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rhymebrain\">rhymebrain</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I found the rhymebrain API, worked on the sentence structure, and created the logo.", "I organized the music, assisted in the creative process, designated sentence structure, and tried to address any issues that arose.", "I did the frontend of the voice synthesis, phrasing, the GUI and a lot of the wording logic.", "I wrote the method that generated the sentences and found words that rhymed and guaranteed those words were nouns.", "I created the name Codiggity, researched rhyming dictionaries that our program could utilize, and helped solve a puzzle to attain speakers.

We saw an opportunity to provide busy people with a quick, convenient, and cool way to check out what's going on today in one simple interface.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PoundPop uses a number of different APIs to aggregate media from across the Internet. It takes in data from news sources as well as various social media outlets to compile a concise and uniform view of what's popular and newsworthy today. Using a fun and easy personality quiz, we gain a sense for each and every user's media preferences. Using this data, we personalize each PoundPop page to the user. From the PoundPop homepage, our users will have the option of \"Popping In\" to posts that interest them. Simply click the \"Pop In\" button and be taken to the original post.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>PoundPop was crafted using the powerful Ruby on Rails framework. Using this framework, our team worked throughout the night to design a user interface and data processing algorithm for this project. On one side of our application, the PoundPop algorithm contacts four different APIs to retrieve social and news data. It unifies this fragmented data and sends it to the front end. Our frond end development team utilized the Bootstrap framework to create a beautiful, mobile-friendly, clean interface for our users to view.</p>\n<p>APIs Used: YouTube, Vine, Twitter, New York Times</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Since our team uses a wide range of equipment including operating systems, computers, and programming environments, we often ran into conflicts with software incompatibility and version control discrepancies. However, we quickly figured out ways to work around these challenges.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we ran into DNS problems which prevented us from fully deploying our site to the domain <a href=\"http://www.poundpop.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.poundpop.com</a>. However, we were able to deploy to the cloud via an alternate domain.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team is extremely proud of the fact that PoundPop utilizes such a high number of APIs to aggregate data. Each of these APIs were very different, and so integration was time consuming and difficult. It is very exciting to see that this integration was able to take place within 24 hours.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it is essential to have a diverse team in which each member brings unique skills to the table. Our team members vary in skills and backgrounds, which helped us to get a wide range of things done. For example, our wonderful project manager Sarah placed tech support calls and developed concepts while our backend developer Zach constructed the server-side applications.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PoundPop</h2>\n<p>We intend to develop this idea further since it seems to fix a common problem in our lives. PoundPop has the potential to reduce our time spent on social media sites. It gives us the ability to stay up-to-date without spending countless hours scrolling in each separate social media app. Our developers have already developed a prototype mobile app in addition to the flagship web version of PoundPop, and so we also would like to see this facet of the project through.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.poundpop.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.poundpop.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.poundpop.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I acted as the lead full-stack developer.

By using a vest we found in the Mall and trimmed thin cutting boards to mount all the electronic pieces on the inside. We also made our own straps so you can pull the vest tighter given different body types</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into: Two of our amps gave out for some unknown reason. We were using them from quite a while and when we mounted them that's when they failed. We tried to trouble shoot and hot wire them into working based on the schematics. They could have given out due to static generated from the vest itself and shorting a key chip on the boards.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of: We got all of them to work for a period of time and we were able to use them with Project Cars, an oculus, and our own 2DOF simulator to create an incredible, real life experience! It truly felt like you were sitting right in the seat of a Formula 1 racecar on any track in the world!</h2>\n<h2>What we learned: Definitely looking into parts a little bit more for possibly small issues that could cause failure.  How to better read, understand and modify circuits and audio signals. Also that we see another application of using the vibrations as like another language that can be used to reproduce means of communications for those who can't hear.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for BeatsVest: Get it working perfectly of course!

Scan their code as they get on, you can quickly check who's there and who's not. Giving away free t-shirt? Keep track of how many times they have <strong>tried</strong> to pick one up. Make your hackathon administering experience more seamless!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We're writing an Android app and using a QR Code library for the scanning process. A web portal for users allows admins to create and monitor events. A PHP Laravel RESTful API on AWS / Ubuntu manages a MySQL database and securely serves data to clients. A Pebble Watch client also displays the QR Code for the scanning process.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Pranav: facing specific challenges with interfacing Angular.js with our RESTful API, handling asynchronous calls and managing specific data as cookies, CORS issues when integrating with Laravel!</p>\n<p>Varun: none - he's counting his blessings!</p>\n<p>Saurabh: rendering QR image on Pebble Watch.</p>\n<p>Jay: Working on a Windows machine after forgetting his MacBook Pro charger at home, writing the entire API in VIM while SSH'd into an Amazon EC2 instance via PuTTy. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're really excited that we have multiple client-facing products that we were able to integrate, making for a really cool system. We feel that it flows really nicely and we were able to do so with relatively little friction, fast debugging and overall strong teamwork! Go team!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Pranav: Angular.js, debugging, additional web-dev considerations!</p>\n<p>Varun: Working fast paced in a team environment and integrating successfully.</p>\n<p>Saurabh: Using zxing for QR Scanning.</p>\n<p>Jay: Being flexible with my given dev tools and getting things done!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Check In</h2>\n<p>We'd love to try using this with a small group of people at an upcoming hackathon!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/zxing\">zxing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material-design</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nginx\">nginx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jayrav13/hackbu-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jayrav13/hackbu-2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thevarunshah/CheckIn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/thevarunshah/CheckIn\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SaurabhPalaspagar/Check-In\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SaurabhPalaspagar/Check-In\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote a PHP Laravel API hosted on AWS.

According to RealizD, a productivity app, I dedicated nearly 4 hours to using my phone daily. Over the course of 60 years, this amounts to a whopping 10 years spent staring at a tiny screen. \nOur app \"FOCUS\" is a productivity app that aims to help users spend less time on their mobile devices, and therefore become more efficient with their time. Even small interruptions caused by incoming messages and Snapchats can wreak havoc on any attempt to concentrate. FOCUS provides users with both negative and positive incentives to get their work done. Users have the option to set a timer for a certain amount of time. As the timer ticks down, an egg slowly hatches into a cute baby dragon. However, if users close out of the app, they will be punished by an embarrassing post on their Facebook timeline which is randomly generated from a collection of phrases in our database.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used swift in XCode for front end development. We implemented this using with the support of Facebook Framework. Once logged in, we have the access to user's profile, friend and post actions (since Facebook has to approve this, this can only be tested through our own Facebook account). We then use a timer and picker view to select punishments and time. We also keep track of users' actions to this app, i.e. quitting the app will result in a notification and ending the timer. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had an enormous amount of trouble getting Facebook authentication as well as issue with server implementations for future expansions. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Although our product isn't quite finished, we are very proud of ourselves for stepping way out of our comfort zone and sticking with it for 24 hours. On the back-end side, we had little to no experience of how to use Node.js or Mongo. Much of our time was spent going learning through tutorials and the documentation.</p>\n<h2>What's next for FOCUS</h2>\n<p>In the future, we hope to implement a LOT more features. We want to include a scoring system and leaderboard where friends can connect with each other and compare their productivity. We also want to bring in a wider assortment of dragons and clean up our drawings a bit. We might also think of more punishments that we can use to hammer in our emphasis on productivity. Perhaps this will entail a monetary incentive, in which users put down some amount of money before they begin the challenge. If they fail, the money will be donated to charity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swiftcd\">swiftcd</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jennywang1028/FOCUS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jennywang1028/FOCUS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on front-end for this project", "I worked on the front end of the project, making the timer", "Worked on backend for derppost", "Worked on backend with MongoDB"]], ["wytecode", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wytecode \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/958/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wytecode \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/960/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wytecode \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/961/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wytecode \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/962/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wytecode \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/963/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"wytecode \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/964/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>From interview sessions to classroom exams, hand-written code is commonly used everywhere.

HaveUReddit is an implementation of python running in a chrome extension which interfaces to reddit and displays the most trending phrases on your current subreddit.  Once installed in chrome, just hit the blue and purple reddit hexagon on the bookmarks bar, to see what's trending!</p>\n<p>We'll get into the technical stuff later, but you can try it out right now by going to the <a href=\"https://github.com/centaurius\" rel=\"nofollow\">Centaurius</a> github project page and download the chrome extension from our 'releases' folder. </p>\n<h3>Done?  Cool, let's move on to the coding!</h3>\n<p>HaveUReddit is a project that is composed of many different elements.  In short, upon clicking the application, the extension loads up an instance of python in the background, polls the current subreddit for data on the words used, and removes extraneous/common phrases.  Finally, the remaining words are plotted in a 'word cloud' format...all in python.</p>\n<p>To create this extension, our team used: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reddit Praw: The Python Reddit API Wrapper</li>\n<li>Matplot Library</li>\n<li>HTML, CSS, JS, Jekyll, Markdown, and Pixlr</li>\n<li>Chrome Developer Framework and Extensions Manager</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>...All in 24 hours!</h5>\n<h3>Why is this project unique?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>It pulls data on the comments from a user-defined subreddit.</li>\n<li>It parses through all the text, eliminates the most common phrases or words, and then plots the results as a word cloud based on frequency.</li>\n<li>Unlike other word cloud generators, our algorithm is open source, written in python, complied in Pyjs, and runs within the browser!</li>\n<li>The algorithm can be used on any text file\n\n<ul>\n<li>We've tested this algorithm on Project Gutenberg books, and it had a low time complexity</li>\n<li>We made the algorithm from scratch.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What have we learned?</h3>\n<p>Using python to create algorithms can be fun and a worthwhile endeavor, but cross-compiling to javascript to run the python code in the browser is difficult</p>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Optimize code better</li>\n<li>Create a .CRX file of our chrome extension</li>\n<li>Test, retest, and test again</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">turtle</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">praw</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pixlr\">pixlr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">matplot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chrome-developer-framework</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jekyll</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/markdown\">markdown</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pyjs</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/centaurius/HaveUReddit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/centaurius/HaveUReddit\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Graphics, Chrome Development and HTML", "I worked on the main algorithm that parses through text and sorts by most common word, as well as writing the main wordcloud illustrate function.w", ""]], ["Spot Search", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spot Search \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/909/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Search tracks, artists and albums</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spot Search \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/943/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Clicking on a card will take you directly to spotify</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spot Search \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/913/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Play the song in Spotify</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spot Search \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/910/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Material design achieved using Materialize css</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spot Search \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/907/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Using the \"I am lucky\" button will direct you to straight to Spotify for the first search result.(this is the home page)</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Spot Search</h1>\n<p>Spot Search is google for music.\nIt allows you to search for tracks,albums and artists, all from the same screen.

I'm glad you asked, but I don't want to spoil the surprise for you so go check it out yourself!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>\"A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>\n<p>Conventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.\"</p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link</a> for the rest of the article.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>While we did have a lot of fun developing our app for the Muse headband, we definitely ran into some problems along the way. First off, we're not entirely sure the Muse headband actually relays any real information. Their brain wave sensors might as well just be random number generators connected to a headband. I said first off like there was more than one problem, but that was by far the most frustrating part of the project to even mention anything else.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>I mean have you played Tippy Toes?!
