[["KinectVR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Going into a project with the hopes of playing with cool hardware, we decided to combine two pieces of equipment that individual do great things, the kinect and Oculus. Individually, we could make some pretty neat hacks, but when we combined the two pieces of hardware, we realized we would be able to create a cheap, easy to setup virtual interactive environment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>KinectVR allows for full room positional tracking of a person, and combined with an oculus, allows for a virtual viewpoint of the room around you. Your entire body becomes part of whatever you create.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using unity integration for the kinect and the oculus rift DK2, we are able to get some basic features out of the box. We ended up having to write a full skeletal tracking system for the player model. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>After bricking two computers, we learned that the Oculus drivers do not play nicely on windows 10. A couple hours later (and a couple of system restores) and we were still frustrated with the lack of support on windows 10 for the Oculus rift. With support channels claiming the issue to be hardware related on the laptop side, whereas an older download of the driver would allow us to run demo programs perfectly, but would crash on our code. After about 12 hours of debugging, and testing what we could, we were fortunate enough to find a friend that had the same laptop model as us, but with windows 8 installed.\nWindows 8 worked a ton better, but we still had an issue of the Oculus blanking it's screen after a few rapid head turns. Surprisingly, a different HDMI cord fixed this issue, even when we knew the Oculus's HDMI cord was fully functional.\nAlong the way, we also faced issues with inconsistent kinect sdk documentation</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're really proud of how smooth the overall project is. Delving into this idea, we were scared of latency between the kinect and Oculus, creating motionsickness and disorientness that we saw with many Oculus demos. Overall, the program has no noticeable latency between the kinect and the Oculus, and the desktop program is fully usable on an above average laptop.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Many of us did not know any Unity going into this project. Each of us can now comfortably say that we would be able to make a simple, if not moderately complex unity program. We also got to use some hardware not typically available to us, and learn the features and advantages of each hardware system.</p>\n<h2>What's next for KinectVR</h2>\n<p>Included in KinectVR is some mock ups for an interactive game, as well as a virtual desktop for a more work centered environment. We hope to have the time to expand upon these concepts, and get a fully functional virtual desktop out of what we currently have. We would also, with more processing power and possibly more kinects, would like to get augmented reality integrated into the project. We had some moderate success with this to begin with, but unfortunately lacked the power to do much with it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">csharp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SamNChiet/KinectVR-Hackathon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SamNChiet/KinectVR-Hackathon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the hardware setup (and 12 hours of debugging) as well as software, design, and testing.", "I worked on designing the user interface.

So, in typical millennial fashion, we decided that we never wanted to have to look in a cookbook again.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Reizoko allows users to take pictures of the items in their fridge, compiles them into a list of ingredients, and returns the optimal recipe as well as relevant information and suggestions.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Step 1: The Front End</strong> \nWe began our design with the mantra of simplicity. We built an easy to use interface which ultimately leads users to take pictures of food items they would use to cook. The entirety of the front end was written from scratch in Swift in Xcode, which offered us flexibility in coding style.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2: Image to Text</strong>\nAfter the user took a picture, we used the CloudSight API, an image processing API, to identify which food product was represented in the image and then return raw data representing that product. The next step was to use natural language processing in order to convert that raw data into a form usable by our next API, Spoonacular.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3: Text to Recipe</strong>\nThe final step in our project, we used the spoonacular API in order to find the optimal recipe based on the list of ingredients, returning the recipe for which we had the most ingredients. The API returned a json object which we then used to extract raw information including the number of ingredients in the recipe that the user owned, the rating of the recipe, and a URL that we could display locally in the app with all relevant instructions.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge we ran into was that two of the people on our team did not know Swift for an iOS project. Then, we realized that one member of our team couldn't even run Swift because he has a PC, which we overcame by setting up a connection to a fellow teammate's Swift server, a function developed by one of the mentors (Gautam Mittal) in a previous project. Moreover, many of the API's we planned on using ended up requiring payment or lacked proper documentation, prompting us to email certain companies requesting full access for a Hackathon, a strategy that proved effective in most instances. Even after receiving access to the API's, we had never worked with REST API's, which posed a new challenge and many hours of seemingly pointless debugging, as is common with learning new subject matter. Finally, the quintessential Hackathon challenge of of time forced our team to really come together and outline ambitious but still reachable (through a combination of sleep deprivation and one too many red bulls) goals.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, we as a team had a cool idea and in less than twenty-four hours, we created a fully functional app from scratch. Moreover, we overcame differences in individual visions of the app to create a complete product which combines our passions and viewpoints.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things we learned at this Hackathon as the value of having a unified vision. We realized a few hours in that if we were all freelancing different parts of the app, we would end up with five different parts for five different apps. Thus, we had to periodically appoint a new person as the \"head\" of the team, who would put forward their vision for the app and point everyone else in the right direction to reach that end goal. Moreover, we solidified our knowledge of swift and the nuts and bolts of iOS app making. Finally, we learned that the technical aspect of any app is only one part of the user experience. Contrary to our expectations coming into the Hackathon, we spent the most time developing a sleek, elegant, but easy to use design for a product.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Reizoko</h2>\n<p>The core of Reizoko is not the product, but rather the people, and we as a group are highly motivated and prepared only for further growth. Our ideas for expansion include but are not limited to:\n    <strong>1) Take one picture of fridge and separate contents automatically.</strong>\n<strong>2) Make the image identification process faster.</strong>\n<strong>3) Maybe build our own classifier for food.</strong>\n<strong>4) Add filters allowing users to specify cuisine, diet type, and nutritional restrictions among other fields.</strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">spoonacular-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud-site-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/imgur\">imgur</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kgupta99/Reizoko\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kgupta99/Reizoko\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end, as well as fixed various issues with the server calls.", "I worked mainly on the front-end and implemented some back-end web scraping.", "I worked on the backend using Alamofire to send HTTP requests, and I specifically integrated the spoonacular and CloudSight REST API's into our iOS project.", "I worked on using the REST API's, as well as on troubleshooting various technical issues.

Further more, students of lower socioeconomic backgrounds sometimes do not have access to tools like the TI84 calculator, which allow them to utilize statistical procedures, whereas they might have access to computers in their schools. We used the synergy of these two principles to inspire the statisticians of tomorrow. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our Java application has the user specify URL with a search term, or something desired to be found on the web page.\nA java web crawler using Jsoup then finds urls, with that search term, and returns any relevant quantitative data to a statistics engine. The statistics engine performs user requested calculations and presents that calculated data in an appropriate format. It can perform basic statistical analysis of one or two links, Z-Test Confidence Intervals and Hypotheses tests, along with the corresponding T-Test Procedures. It can also calculate various forms or regression and upon choosing the optimal equation, display it graphically. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Jsoup- With the help of Jsoup we created a java web crawler that finds the first instance of the inputted search term.\n The program then parses the page the search term is located on, and gets relevant quantitative data with regard to the search term. \n Statistical Engine- Using  the Jsoup web crawler and integrating bing search query, we quickly found functions to use to perform calculations like normal distributions, student's distributions, as well as various regressions.                                        </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Because we only found out about JSoup halfway through the hackathon, our original web-crawler tried checking the content using a rudimentary HTML Parser we wrote ourselves, which was susceptible to code that did not follow standard formatting conventions. To solve this, we researched, and replaced our method with a methods from JSoup that reversed our process and therefore received the same result without compromising memory.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> We are quite proud of the integration with Bing, because we had to study HTTP request protocols to integrate Bing search query with Java, such that our algorithm can get results that are fine-tuned to what the user requests. We are also quite proud of our dysfunctional, self-built HTML parser, but it needs to be refined before we can implement it in an algorithm such as this.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned search engine query integration, as well as the complexity of many, many statistic formulas we often took for granted, as well as, of course, the importance of teamwork!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Stats Engine</h2>\n<p>We hope to improve the GUI, and include more statistical analysis options.

Lazy uses this philosophy to enhance the productivity experience and make a unique app unlike the thousands of other productivity apps out there.</p>\n<p>This psychology has also been proven with through a topic in economics and decision theory, called loss aversion.

To code the audio test we recorded the environment for over a period of time and then we analyzed the decibel levels that we got from the voice recording.

For brightness we got the value of the the screen's brightness because the screen's brightness is adjusted automatically based on the environment's lighting. The value of the screen's brightness is between 0-100. If the value of the screen's brightness is below 25 then the location is not optimally lit. If the value is between 25 and 50 then the location is moderately lit and if the screen brightness is above 50 then the room is optimally lit.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The hardest challenge we ran into was trying to make the test.

The first method, \"color generator\", produces random hex color values using \"math.random\". To use it, the user has to simply tap the blue circular button. As a result, the background will change to a randomly generated color. The process is simple, and easy to use. Moreover, the second method, \"tremble\" is another available option to relieve stress. When the triangular button is clicked, the mobile device vibrates for three seconds. A simple tap, can stop the vibration, and after the three seconds are over, the timer is re-set, and the user can feel free to start again. All of the options provide a back button, to the start screen of the application, allowing a simple transition between each method.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Real-Lief is built through the use of Android Studio, using the language Java.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We encountered some obstacles when designing the buttons, and implementing the color generator.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're satisfied to know, that we successfully built an app, that any person can use to fight through a stressful experience.</p>\n<h1>What we learned</h1>\n<p>We learned how to generate random colors, and control the vibration settings in a phone.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Real Lief</h2>\n<p>We're in the process of adding more options a costumer can use to relive their stress.

We decided to make an app which could have the potential to save lives by translating text to speech to an emergency service operator, and thus Emergency Contactor was created.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Emergency Contactor allows users to submit text into a web form that asks for information such as location, name, phone number, and description of the situation.

They decided to target a large problem emerging in today's society, especially the young people-public speaking. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The virtual reality application utilizes the power of the Oculus Rift to give a unique experience than any other screen. It gives the user the feeling of standing before a crowd at a podium to deliver a speech. This is to simulate a real life situation. The user is given a customizable script, that he/she will read. The speech recognition software verifies that all the words spoken are correct and accurate. The Myo even furthers the realistic feel. It shows a pair of hands that can be used to rehearse hand gestures, or identify negative hand tendencies. All these core technologies come together into one to deliver a powerful, efficient solution to nervous rehearsals in front of the bathroom mirror.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The application was build with one idea in mind-make the experience as real as possible. Kevin worked on the main scene of the application. All the people, the podium, the building, and the microphone were designed and implemented by him. Matthew worked on the Microsoft Speech API, to ensure that there was a fully functional speech recognition software. Justin worked on the Myo, to make sure that the hand gestures were accurate and precise. Marissa worked on the website, to make a efficient site that was also beautiful. After each part was completed, they were brought together as one, and VR Public Speaking Prep was born.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some challenges that were encountered were the issues with making the Microsoft Speech API work well with the Unity scene, having the Oculus Rift work on Windows 10, due to Oculus' non-support of Windows 10, and making the accurate hand gestures for the Myo.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The team is proud of their hard work and dedication on this project.

We also want to generate candidates based on geographic location.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sprite-kit\">sprite-kit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">csv</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">isidewith.com</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gimp\">gimp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">textedit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Hackathon-Team/CandidateCatch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Hackathon-Team/CandidateCatch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["OnBoard", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/asqzJ82S6oQ?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OnBoard \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/869/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Discussion feature for each of the pinned cards so the biggest design decisions do not get lost</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OnBoard \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/870/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Whiteboard functionality to draw out your design and explain each component, allowing members to visualize and build on ideas</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OnBoard \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/340/871/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Get OnBoard to bring your ideas to the front</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Why do we hack? To solve problems. We start with a goal, and test our ideas to solve a problem. We start with a brainstorm - we deliberate over our ideas, each of us trying to explain the design, discussing the pros and cons. Post-it notes on a wall, scribbles on a sheet of paper, markers on a whiteboard, but in the end it's hard for everyone to voice their ideas and most of our notes are illegible gibberish. As we build, designs get revised, we continuously go back to the drawing board, repeating this process countless times.</p>\n<p>Ideas get lost, reasoning behind decisions are forgotten, we lose focus, and a seemingly easy project can get held up by the smallest obstacles. <strong>But now, we present to you OnBoard.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>OnBoard brings your ideas to the front</strong>, allowing you and your team to easily focus on your design and manage your workflow. Get OnBoard with your team, and be able to share visual concepts, clearly explain your thoughts, and be able to bounce ideas off of your team members. Most of all, <strong>OnBoard puts the most important ideas first</strong>. Pinned cards with discussion threads ensure that the biggest design decisions do not get lost. Chat connects group members instantly, allowing for seamless communication. Draw out your design and explain each component, allowing members to visualize and build on ideas. Arrange boards in your workflow as your project evolves.<strong>OnBoard lets you take your ideas and collaborate.</strong></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>OnBoard is an HTML5 website, powered by Javascript. Drawing functionality is through JQuery and Javascript\u2019s canvas.We use Reactjs as our view library in conjunction with redux to manage the application state. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>OnBoards creation was slowed by not having a discussion forum that could effectively manage ideas and make our workflow efficient. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud of our whiteboard functionality and our discussion threads. By Getting OnBoard, you can use these to optimize your design process.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Working on OnBoard taught us to value the design process. As we thought which functions would be most useful to teams, we were able to apply a lot of these ideas and guidelines to our own development. On the more technical side, we learned how to apply node packages and JS libraries. We gained insight on the most intuitive UI and UX, and we hope that this is evident in your experience with OnBoard.</p>\n<h2>What's next for OnBoard</h2>\n<p>OnBoard endeavours to continue making discussions more intuitive for groups. Additional functionality like a Kanban board, and the ability to join multiple groups will be added. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-10\">windows-10</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gulp-js\">gulp.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">browserify</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/redux\">redux</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nvisage/Nvisage\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nvisage/Nvisage\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://nvisage.github.io/#/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://nvisage.github.io/#/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>nvisage.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the canvas and draw functionality using HTML 5, JavaScript CSS, Jquery and node js packages.

We were kind of sad that our previous project didn't work out very well, but we realized that the food truck had food readily available for us, because they were called. We then thought of how our high school campuses are open, allowing students during lunch and free periods to go get food and such outside of campus. We thought it would be a good idea to have instead of a giant mass of people swarming the nearest restaurant, we could have people take orders for each other. It was a win-win situation in our eyes.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web application allows students to request food and view orders from their classmates. We used the Twilio API to send text messages to the students who order and to notify them of their order status, as well as to the \"Dashers\".</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Before we started CampusDash, we tried a project with the Edison board. We ran it to several issues while connecting the board to the command line.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our password and email address verification, our Twilio API integration, and the CSS design.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CampusDash</h2>\n<p>The next step for CampusDash would be to create a chat room with the orderee and the student picking up the order.

Just a few weeks ago, I was invited to a camp at Stanford hosted by <a href=\"http://js.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">JS.IO</a>, which is a platform for making any type of application, whether it be iOS, Android, or a web app. Best of all, it's coded in Javascript. At the camp, I got beta access to it, which is what we used to create this project.</p>\n<p>When we started to brainstorm, we though it would be great to make an application. It would be simple yet addicting, like Flappy Bird. </p>\n<h2>WHAT IT DOES</h2>\n<p>You are an SD card in the middle of a motherboard. The bytes are flying at you like crazy, and you must dodge them in order to not fill up your SD card and overflow your memory!</p>\n<h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>\n<p>Your goal is to get as many points as possible, which is achieved by staying alive. Each binary you successfully dodge is counted towards your score, which is shown at the top of the screen. There's even a high score part at the bottom to try and beat yourself! You have five lives.\nThere are also brackets <code>[]</code> which fly at you. When you collide with the brackets, you will gain points.</p>\n<h3>LEVELS</h3>\n<p>There are five levels. Every 100 points, you level up. When you level up, the maximum lives you have is diminished by one, but your lives are automatically filled to that maximum.</p>\n<h2>HOW WE BUILT IT</h2>\n<p>We built it with a program called <a href=\"http://js.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">JS.IO</a>, which is not public yet.</p>\n<h2>CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO</h2>\n<p>We ran into several challenges, including syntax errors, lack of sleep, hardware bugs (with the JS.IO servers we used) many, <em>many</em>, <em><strong>many</strong></em> bugs, and much more.</p>\n<h2>ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE'RE PROUD OF</h2>\n<p>We're proud that we made it through it, and were proud that we stayed up all night and didn't fall asleep. We're also proud that we made a website to showcase the app, which can be found here: <a href=\"http://electrofighter.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">electrofighter.co</a> (provided by <a href=\"http://pop.co\" rel=\"nofollow\">pop.co</a>!). We finished in time, and we met our standards!</p>\n<h2>WHAT WE LEARNED</h2>\n<p>We both learned how to push to GitHub, which is now where our entire project (500 lines!) is located. We also learned how to debug in a deeper way.</p>\n<h2>WHAT'S NEXT FOR ELECTROFIGHTER</h2>\n<p>Electrofighter has some pretty messy code and will probably get a rewrite soon enough, as well as a boss fight and a few other cool features. We're hoping to release it to the Google Play Store and the App Store soon!</p>\n<h2>WHAT YOU CAN CURRENTLY DO</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, we don't have the licenses to submit these applications to the Google and Apple stores, but we have built (for free) a web version, which can be accessed below.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

Made at Los Altos Hacks 2016!</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>cH p ce p cl p cl p co p c, p c\\s p cw p co p cr p cl p cd p c! p\n</code></pre>\n<p>A \"Hello, world!\" program.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>i p h\ufffd\n</code></pre>\n<p>Outputs the input.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>g\ufffd\n</code></pre>\n<p>Infinite loop.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>ce s o r c\n p l h\ufffd\n</code></pre>\n<p>Counts down from 100 to 0.</p>\n<h2>Tutorial</h2>\n<p>Nonsense is stack-based, meaning that it uses an array (or stack) as memory storage instead of variables. The stack only holds numbers, and virtually all operators work using the stack. In this case, the stack is of infinite length and all stack items are initialized to 0.</p>\n<p><strong>TIP</strong>: Look at <code>interpreter.js</code> to help speed up the learning process.</p>\n<h3>Syntax</h3>\n<p>All commands are space-separated. The first character in each \"word\" is the command, and the second character is only evaluated as an argument if the command takes one. <code>\\s</code> is used in place of a space character if necessary as an argument. All other characters after are ignored.</p>\n<p>Here's an example of a program:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>i p\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, the same code can be written as:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>illegal potatoes\n</code></pre>\n<p>because only <code>i</code> and <code>p</code> (neither of which take arguments) are evaluated.</p>\n<h3>Operators</h3>\n<h4>Stack Pointer</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>l</code> and <code>r</code>: Move pointer to left/right one item. Example: if the stack is <code>[5,6,7]</code> and the pointer is pointing at <code>5</code>, then <code>l</code> moves pointer to point at <code>0</code> (remember: the stack is padded with 0's!), while <code>r</code> moves the pointer to point at <code>6</code>.</li>\n<li><code>n</code>: Takes 1 character as an argument and moves to the pointer to the stack index as defined by the character's charcode. Example: if the stack is <code>[5,6,7]</code>, <code>n\ufffd</code> would move the pointer to point at <code>6</code>, regardless of where the pointer was before.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>I/O</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>i</code>: Shift the first character from the input and push to the stack at the pointer.</li>\n<li><code>o</code>: Output number at the pointer.</li>\n<li><code>p</code>: Output charcode representation of number at pointer. Example: If <code>55</code> is under the pointer, <code>p</code> would output 7.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Arithmetic</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>a</code> and <code>s</code>: Increment/decrement number under pointer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Control Flow</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>g</code>: A <code>goto</code> command. Takes 1 character <code>n</code> as an argument and goes to <code>n</code>th command in the code. This could be used as a way to create an infinite loop.</li>\n<li><code>h</code>: Conditional <code>goto</code> command. Works like <code>g</code>, except it only executes <code>goto</code> if the number at the pointer isn't 0. Otherwise, the code continues as normally.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Stack Pushing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>c</code>: Takes 1 character as an argument and pushes its charcode to the stack under the pointer.</li>\n<li><code>x</code>: Sets number under pointer to the index at the stack.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Logic</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>G</code>, <code>E</code>, and <code>L</code>: Greater than, equal to, and less than operators. Modifies the stack at the pointer with either 1 or 0 depending on the criterion.</li>\n<li><code>A</code>, <code>O</code>, and <code>X</code>: Bitwise AND, OR, and XOR. Modifies the stack at the pointer accordingly.</li>\n<li><code>N</code>: Logical not. Modifies the stack at the pointer accordingly.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://molarmanful.github.io/nonsense-lang\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://molarmanful.github.io/nonsense-lang\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>molarmanful.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/molarmanful/nonsense-lang\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/molarmanful/nonsense-lang\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did it all from scratch.
