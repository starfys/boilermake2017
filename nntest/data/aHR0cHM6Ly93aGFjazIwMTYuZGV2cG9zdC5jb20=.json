People who are visually impaired find that being at home the safest because of the familiarity that they have with their house. Our mission is to bring the world to them, make it familiar, and make it as easy to navigate in other buildings as it is in one\u2019s own home. Our app uses bluetooth beacons placed at key locations around the building to notify the differently-abled when they are nearby the nearest bathroom, elevator, or staircase. </p>\n<p>The application runs on a mobile device so that the user can walk around with the app helping the user navigate through the building and making the building more accessible and visually impaired friendly. When a user comes within 3 meters of a beacon, the app buzzes, reads a location message, and changes color. Because this is an app for the visually impaired, the visual side of app design is very simple. </p>\n<p>This is a cost effective way to make up for our lack of accommodation for the visually impaired, as beacons can be purchased and installed for less than $10 each.  We want to stress that even while we developed this app with visual impairment in mind, the app can be used by people of any ability to navigate confusing buildings. We feel that this is important because it helps to remove some of the stigma that may be associated with using a device meant for those with impairments.  And let\u2019s be honest, wouldn't you like to know what floor of the science center you have found yourself?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Meeting the Demand", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Due to the lack of proper technological infrastructure countries in local communities like Haiti, Russia, and Mexico, many health non-profits like Partners in Health are unable to provide the full health support to the countries.

Rather than just inputting how many calories they have eaten, the user sets a daily goal for a variety of different categories, such as water, fruits, vegetables, and grains. The user is also able to keep track of different activities, like sleep and exercise. This is a more holistic approach for someone who just wants to be healthier and keep track of their habits.

When Uplift came to WHACK and shared their problem statement, we were inspired to build something that would help combat online abuse in a significant way. We agree that calling abusers out is important; however, we also believe that embarrassing an abuser often exacerbates the behavior, opposed to curbing it. Through gentle suggestions that aim to educate the user, we hope to end ignorant hurtful remarks online. </p>\n<p>As more and more schools provide computers for students, we hope that schools will pre-download our extension. We imagine this tool to be especially impactful for middle and high school students who may be just beginning to become aware of the social impact that their online presence can have. This extension will provide a real-time reminder for users to be mindful of their posts and comments.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Anti-Troll Harassment Checker is an extension for Google Chrome that analyzes text a user types in any text box, checking it for misogynistic, racist, homophobic, or other problematic content as well as performing a sentiment analysis on it. If any problematic content is detected, a popup appears with an appropriate quote, a brief explanation, and relevant links that the user can navigate to if they are particularly interested in learning more.</p>\n<p>Users can also click the extension's icon to view a popup with a text box and submit button, where they can enter and check select phrases.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote JavaScript code that executes every half second after a user stops typing sends the content that was typed to a background Python script (hosted on a Flask server), which utilizes the Watson API to perform a sentiment analysis. The script then sends back an appropriate response to display in the popup, which we designed with HTML and CSS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was our first time building a Chrome extension, and we definitely had some trouble understanding how the it connected to the browser, and how the server played a role in relaying information between the content and the background. \nAt first we didn't know how to access the content that was typed in the browser, and learned a lot about JavaScript on our way to getting that to work!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Using the Watson API was very new and cool for us, and we were definitely really excited about being able to use that to get a more accurate idea on how to judge content. In general, we stayed focused and cohesive as a team, and worked hard to create something that  we could see making a tangible impact on communities.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned so much about the structure of extensions, JavaScript, working with CSS, and how HTTP requests work!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Anti-Troll Harassment Checker</h2>\n<p>We want to transition Anti-Troll Harassment Checker from a local Flask server to AWS, and fix some bugs in the code. Currently the content checking in the popup text box works as expected, but isn't as successful with content typed in the browser webpage. We have responses from the server being printed out in the console, and eventually we'd like some sort of alert or desktop notification to relay our messages and links.</p>\n<p>We currently don't have links included in the popup message, and it would be cool to be able to have the links change based on the most current and reliable information available, as well as links the user has clicked on before. This way, the user can keep learning about more nuanced topics as they become more and more familiar with social issues through this extension.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">watsonapi</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jacquelineyoung8/harassment-check.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jacquelineyoung8/harassment-check.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote the backend in Python using Flask and the Watson AlchemyLanguage API.

It allows doctors in remote regions with poor internet connection to send medical requests to vendors. It also allows the vendors to better allocate their supplies and predict the demand for future orders. It collects the medical requests from doctors in those regions and processes the information in a relational database. It displays the order record for each vendor and provides data analysis for demands of each medicine in a dashboard.</p>\n<p>Our codes use Twilio to process the SMS messages from users and send the information to database. Our codes use MySQL to create and maintain a relative database that includes database to keep records of vendors, doctors, medicine, vendor-medicine, doctor-orders. Our project uses Node.js to build the backend, AngularJS to communicate between the database and the front-end, HTM,CSS, JavaScript, Angular-chart.js for the front-end design.  </p>\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Twilio - process the SMS messages from users and send the information to database</li>\n<li>MySQL - create and maintain a relative database that includes records of vendors, doctors, medicine, vendor-medicine, doctor-orders</li>\n<li>Node.js - backend language</li>\n<li>AngularJS - communicate between the database and the front-end</li>\n<li>Angular-chart.js - data visualization</li>\n<li>HTML,CSS, JavaScript - front-end design</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Authors</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arpit Bansal, Dorothy</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angular-chart.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/abansal3/whack-healthcare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/abansal3/whack-healthcare\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Accessing the Access Van", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Accessing the Access Van \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/847/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Accessing the Access Van \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/869/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Accessing the Access Van \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/846/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Accessing the Access Van \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/848/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Accessing the Access Van \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/879/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Accessing the Access Van \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/844/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We have seen that getting to class via the Access Van is cumbersome and inefficient -- students have to call and often aren't able to get to class in the 10 minute breaks throughout the day.  We've also seen how much more streamline dispatching from the Campus Police station could be if there was an expected rides schedule for each day.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Accessing the Access Van integrates various components into one easy-to-use webpage.  One aspect is a form where students can request rides online and in advance.  This data can then be seen from the administrator's point of view so that rides can be scheduled in an organized fashion.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The website itself was build using bootstrap, html, and css.  The form was coded using html as well.  The data collection and organization was done through Python.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating the front end with the back end was the most challenging part.  Also, we spent a lot of time writing code to process the form submissions and put them into a spreadsheet format.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We coded the form ourselves to implement different features, including a drop down menu and a drop down calendar.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We strengthened our ability to use html and css at higher levels.  We also learned how to use the terminal to navigate through our directories and run programs through the command line.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Accessing the Access Van</h2>\n<p>In the future, we would like to add an Night Access Van tracker so that students can fully utilize the access van service by better timing their travel.   </p>\n<p>We also would like to look into adding a texting or online feature to notify the Night Driver that they are waiting for a ride.  If the night driver was able to know where people were waiting to be picked up on their route, the system would be more efficient and less stressful for both parties.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["The Accessibility Index", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Accessibility Index \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/982/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Accessibility Index \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/985/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Accessibility Index \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/986/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Accessibility Index \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/988/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Accessibility Index \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/990/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Accessibility Index \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/991/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"The Accessibility Index \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/418/995/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of the problem spaces for this hackathon was accessibility. Our team was inspired by our peers who are differently abled. We realized there was a lot we could contribute in terms of allyship (building empathy) and service.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web app is a two facing platform. Clients enter the homepage and can choose two paths. If you\u2019re an ally (someone who does not have a disability and wants to contribute to the discussion), you may play our game. Our game aims to teach empathy in users through role playing. </p>\n<p>More about the RPG - The RPG seeks to foster empathy and allyship by emulating the experiences relayed to us by some of our poll takers with personal experiences with accessibility needs and conflicts. It uses abstractions of some different experiences of disability (the encryption and scrambling of text to represent learning barriers, and a hard, variant limit to energy as a resource for physical barriers). The user plays a character with an undiagnosed learning disability and an undiagnosed physical disability who starts out at the beginning of a school week with a new assignment that they are unable to complete because they cannot read it on time. Their goal is to complete the assignment. </p>\n<p>This is a choose-your-own game that seeks to represent some experiences of trying to navigate accessibility issues without a diagnosis, the process of being diagnosed and the time and monetary resources required to do so, issues of cultural approaches to disability (and what it is like to access the resources one may need when their family and friends don\u2019t \u2018believe\u2019 in disability and therefore do not help), and the disproportionate amount of energy and time it would take the student to try and navigate the issue with no help whatsoever. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, it is our hope that this game will be a learning experience for users without diagnosed disabilities to more deeply consider why accessibility is an important issue, and to think more flexibly about the variety of barriers individuals may face when navigating academic systems due to a lack of accessibility resources. We also hope this may encourage those who play to think about what kind of resources exist on their campus, and if those resources are available or functional. </p>\n<p>More about the accessibility resources - We envisioned this to be like a college prowler but specifically for questions relating to accessibility. Students at different schools can rate their campuses in terms of accessibility, resource allocation, professor attitudes towards differently abled students, etc.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Python, Javascript, and Flask.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>None of us knew each other before the hackathon and are really proud of how we came together to make our ambitions a reality. We each taught and learned from each other about new tools, languages, and hacks. </p>\n<p>We all also participated in polling research and academic research regarding the general knowledge our peer group has regarding accessibility issues, as well as existing laws, academic standards, programs and cultural spaces specific to the issue. This raised our awareness and empathy, and so we were able to deepen our skills in interfacing between software development as a technological feat, but also as a humanitarian feat, and the importance of working with people to create with them in mind. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our team was comprised of lots of first time hackers! We learned how to use the git workflow, how to navigate new languages/frameworks (flask, sql, python), and how to move through the design process to product shipping (interviewing, creating personas, storyboarding, code writing, debugging).</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Accessibility Index</h2>\n<p>In the future, we\u2019d love to work on furthering progress for the implementation. Right now we have a wireframe for the RPG but would really like to add gamification elements and improve the user experience. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://app-env.pjp3gekvtu.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://app-env.pjp3gekvtu.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>app-env.pjp3gekvtu.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lisaztruong/team2_whack2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lisaztruong/team2_whack2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front end,\nGame design and mock-ups,\nProject Proposal and facilitation", "", "", ""]]]
