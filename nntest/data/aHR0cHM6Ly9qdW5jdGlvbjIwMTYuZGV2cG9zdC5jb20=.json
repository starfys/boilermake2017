We were intrigued by the Sohjoa virtual bus stops challenge. It allowed us to design a bus service we would love to use ourselves: a cheap but efficient alternative for the taxi/uber. We wanted to hack a bunch of state of the art tech together to show how a dynamic bus service could work.</p>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>Event organizers have trouble getting their attendees to the event venue. Public transportation may not be enough and organizing custom transportation is expensive and time-consuming. The best practice for custom transportation so far is to organize a route from a pre-defined point X to the venue using a pre-defined schedule. The customers will still have to travel to point X before they can use the arranged transportation. They will have to schedule their day based on the transportation's schedule. If they don't want to deal with these problems they can choose to use their own car or get a taxi/UBER, which gets expensive really fast.  </p>\n<p>Technically, this kind of problem is often referred to as the last mile problem. We wanted to tackle a variation of this: the first mile problem. Even with just some tens of passengers there are millions of possible routes between them, let alone when a third variable, time, is taken into account.</p>\n<h2>The solution</h2>\n<p>Our project for Junction 2016 aims to solve the transportation problem by using <a href=\"http://sohjoa.fi/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sohjoa</a> to organize dynamic and cost controlled custom transportation. Our concept is a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. If the surroundings of a location are pre-scanned the bus can plan and drive routes that are planned on-the-go.  Our tool makes the required optimizations to the route, chooses a smart way to transport people from their desired pick-up location and tells Sohjoa which route and schedule to follow during the transportation. </p>\n<h2>The use cases</h2>\n<p>1) Event transportation<br/>\nEvents organize group transportation to boost visitor counts. Doing this in a cost efficient way is what really matters. Unlike public transportation there is a more clear business model: people bring in money, so it is worth investing money to bring them to the event. Our routing algorithm allows prioritization by cost, which means that people can be transported on a price per visitor basis.<br/>\n2) The commuter's first mile<br/>\nCurrently public transportation is organized around node points such as railway or metro stations. However, the last mile or so is often the most unconvinient for a commuter. Busses to less populated areas leave seldomly and can't stop at everyones home. Our service can create efficient routes that transport everyone from and to the general area of their home - adjusting dynamically to demand thus being able to take the shortest route to the destination.  </p>\n<h2>The tech</h2>\n<p>The service is running on a node.js server, with React and Redux used for the web UI. Our algorithms are written in Python so we can leverage state of the art Machine Learning libraries.<br/>\n1) Clustering user data<br/>\n  - Recursive DBSCAN machine learning algorithm to reduce the complexity of the spacetime data.<br/>\n2) Sjukstra routing<br/>\n  - Customized Djikstra that takes into account cost-factors that are specific to electric buses<br/>\n3) Routing with EMBERS<br/>\n  - Leveraging Embers route planning to get fast routes between virtual bus stops<br/>\n4) Data visualisation with leaflet<br/>\n  - Intuitive and easy to use planning and visualisation tool for virtual bus stops<br/>\n5) Telegram (SujuBot) end user demo<br/>\n  - Example of an end user UI. Helps envision how the service would look for an end user.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>The project required long hours and took our very best effort. In the end, even though at times we had problems and didn't always feel like we were progressing, we were able to create a prototype of a service that helps better imagine what is possible and how shared transportation could work. We have coded through the entire night and currently have our fingers crossed that our pitcher will stay awake through Sunday.</p>\n<p>Our main challenges were parametrizing and developing algorithms to solve the initial routing problem, we had to develop them almost from scratch. Integrating our different parts to a seamless and consistent service took lots of time and effort. Lastly, it was difficult to prioritize and scope a presentable MVP, the problem was complex and had numerous points of possible failure.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>Our project is left open ended. It could be taken towards multiple of development directions, but only time will tell. We hope that during the judging phase we will get inspiring suggestions or feedback on our project.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We all know this situation: You have an important presentation and the beamer is not working. Nowadays you pick up the phone and call up the facility worker or write an email. After a while the guy will eventually show up, analyse the problem, go back to get some additional tools and finally solve it. In the mean time you and 10 other people are waiting without knowing what is going on... Reporting and tracking incidents should be easy and efficient, everyone wants them to be fixed asap. There are many powerful tools that try to solve those problems, but they all lack one important thing: Simplicity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Facily enables employees to create a service request by taking a single picture, the software will take care of the rest. By combining a powerful machine learning driven backend and UX optimized user facing apps, the system we are offering brings your incident reporting to the next level.</p>\n<p>The system uses machine learning to automatically classify your request and assign it to the best suited service worker. Context information (e.g. sensors and historic data) allow us to automatically determine the urgency of an issue, as well as provide smart suggestions to both the employee and the service worker to fix the problem asap. Guided by these suggestions an employee will be able to do simple tasks and sometimes even resolve his problem before an issue is generated.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Both user-facing apps, are built with Ionic 2 and therefore support Android and iOS.</p>\n<p>The main goal for the employee app is to create a straight forward reporting process, that's why we decided to build it like a conversation. By leveraging machine learning and context information, the user's input is kept to the bare minimum making it very straight forward and fast to report the incident.</p>\n<p>The worker app provides the user with the needed context information to keep the round trips between service location and storage rooms to the bare minimum and empower the service worker.</p>\n<p>Both apps communicate through a horizontally scalable python Django backend hosted on Microsoft Azure and use the latest machine learning algorithms to classify incidents and provide the needed context information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Besides the usual coding issues, our main challenge was to keep focus on our initial goal: A simple solution for the user with a great user experience. The temptation was big to try to integrate every sensor available and display it to the user. But the key to success is to do one thing, and do it well. Once the app is working as intended, new features can still easily be added. But it's important to stay focussed on the task at hand. Keep it simple, stupid!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The user interface is very intuitive and fun to use. Using machine learning to classify images as well as learn from the context information to automatically create tasks. Another interesting aspect is that the system can automatically train itself by using the pictures and data provided by the users.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>It is important to define the main goal of the app early. We spent quite some time even later during development to resolve differences of opinion about some aspects of the app, even though we had discussed them before at some point.</p>\n<h2>What's next for facily</h2>\n<p>There are many more ideas we could not implement because of the limited time. The user facing app will remain approximately the same too keep its simplicity. However, the worker app, as well as the backend, can be easily extended. Some ideas we had include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect duplicate issues and combine them automatically</li>\n<li>Give suggestions of parts to take for the service worker based on topics</li>\n<li>Detect urgency based on environment\n\n<ul>\n<li>Customers involved/nearby =&gt; critical</li>\n<li>A lot of people near asset =&gt; urgent</li>\n<li>Multiple duplicate issues =&gt; high</li>\n<li>Assets can be marked as important</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Anomaly detection to find issues\n\n<ul>\n<li>A desk has been unused for a week</li>\n<li>Printer did not connect during working hours</li>\n<li>Asset has not been used for an unusual amount of time</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Train new assets by using pictures taken by employees</li>\n<li>Allow employees to give a signature on the device</li>\n<li>Natural language processing to analyze written requests.</li>\n<li>Admin Panel to see overall performance measurements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The appetite for efficient facility service solutions is huge, so our next step is to create a business plan, find possible investors and partners to promote the solution. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AndreasGassmann/junction-employee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AndreasGassmann/junction-employee\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lukeisontheroad/junction-worker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lukeisontheroad/junction-worker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dcale/incident_reporter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dcale/incident_reporter\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://facily.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://facily.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>facily.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Sakari", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We started out with trying to think of uses for the Oura ring.

This is our first hackathon and we've had a great time.</p>\n<h1>Our product</h1>\n<p>We chose to work on Intelligent Buildings, specifically on the GE Money Energy track. We set out to develop a solution which could help companies and private users minimise both their electricity bills and their environmental impact. Our application is split up into 3 distinct parts:</p>\n<h2>1: Data aggregation</h2>\n<p>Our algorithms scrape data from the web to gather information about a users previous electricity usage, as well as the prices for electricity for the coming days.</p>\n<h2>2: Presentation</h2>\n<p>The data is then summarised in a heat map of electricity consumption represented in a ring on Komdo.tech.</p>\n<h2>3: Analysis</h2>\n<p>Algorithms perform an analysis on the aggregated data in order to produce smart notifications about when the user is effectively consuming electricity. The smart notifications display how to change electricity usage to minimise both spending as well as carbon footprint. These notifications also display the amount of money saved if the changes where to be implemented. Users receive text messages about how they should change their energy consumption to save money and minimise their carbon footprint.  </p>\n<h1>Our Impact</h1>\n<p>We developed a platform which can deliver data to be represented and analysed in very different contexts. The algorithms can be modified to produce insights about electricity usage, and the aggregated data can be represented in varying forms (we chose a circle, because circles are round, like our dear planet). We believe our platform holds the potential to be used for future projects to help users better understand their electricity usage, and change it to better fit their ambitions.</p>\n<h2>The future for Komdo</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of our achievements and what we managed to build here at Junction. Our ambition is to continue working on Komdo by developing a mobile application and a customised environment tailored to each users needs. We will also continue to develop our smart algorithms to provide more versatile suggestions which span over a wide spectrum of future predictive analysis. A key future usage example would be delivering our smart suggestions about energy consumption changes to automated electricity devices such as Google NEST for example.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gustaver/Junction2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/gustaver/Junction2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://calm-peak-94128.herokuapp.com/app\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://calm-peak-94128.herokuapp.com/app\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>calm-peak-94128.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on backend, made sure everything was connected and hooked up properly.

An avatar accompanies the child on his journey and explains every step in a simple and visual manner.</p>\n<p><strong>Parents' view</strong>: By including the GE Opera API, parents receive live updates about the treatment progress and scheduled examinations.\nFurthermore, parents have a dashboard, allowing them to support the child during the whole affair, as well as being prepared for all eventualities.\nIn stress situations, things tend to get overlooked. By providing extensive checklists, the parents are able to focus on more important aspects.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using react-native, we simultaneously built one app for IOS and Android devices. It connects to our simulated GE Opera API, allowing us to display realtime status updates.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Having no example data or mocked API from GE Healthcare, we built an API simulation based on the data given.\nOn a non-technical level, we were forced to translate medical terms to easy-to-understand descriptions.

And not rarely we like to stay in bed on a rainy Sunday. In Finland Sundays are dark. So we need to turn on the lights while we're still in bed, so we can read a nice book.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Dynalight (TM) is a machine-learning powered real time data fusion all-around service platform for the smart home and company. A heat camera can detect and count persons so you can see the busy spots and easily automize the lighting in your building. Also gestures can be detected and used to control the lights, for example from your bed. \nWith our integrated VR Lightguide (TM) you can guide your guests even when you're not at home or in your workplace.<br/>\nAnd that's not all: Dynalight Biofilter (TM) can automatically remove persons and other moving objects from a series of pictures. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Here at Dynalight we only work with \"brightest\" ideas, so our team of experts hacked together this suite solutions in just 2 days, and just for you. So we used an array of tools, including unity, python, processing, a thermal and an hd camera on a raspberry pi and of course smart lights. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We faced many different challenges and learned a ton of stuff during these days: From trying to compile libraries that did not want to, learning to use OpenCV and the interface with the thermal camera, learning to feed images in neural networks, trying to access the smart lights via their REST API and using processing to detect persons in images.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We actually built a somewhat working prototype that counts persons in a live video feed from the heat camera. While working on many different approaches we also produced a lot of different ideas to interact with the thermal camera. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A hackathon is a great place to get to know people, built stuff together and learn from each other. It would be probably great to come with a plan and idea but it's also not necessary since when you start building and trying things out more and more ideas start coming.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Dynalight</h2>\n<p>We will extend our ideas and build on our prototypes. A first step would be to have one or more minimal prototypes that we could test with our users. Then, once the gesture detection works, we will stay in bed, switch the lights off and on, remove all persons from our pictures and count the people in our homes and get rich.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/augmented-reality\">augmented-reality</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Purrgatory", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Purrgatory \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/462/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Save the kittens!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to do something different, with a device that is new to both of us.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Kittens are falling from heaven, but they are fragile creatures and can not handle long drops.

You must then hit markers appearing on the screen in order to score points against your opponent. The player who gets the most points wins!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We use computer vision to construct a skeleton of the player from a webcam feed, using this skeleton we can calculate the relative distances from the person to the point and calculate whether a person has hit a point. Node JS and socket sessions share game state between clients.</p>\n<h3>Microservices</h3>\n<h4>Audio-Merge</h4>\n<p>Using Python, Request and Flask to implement a genre and BPM based API for Deezer. Allowing us to generate full mix tracks from Deezer's 30 second previews using Pydub.</p>\n<h4>Skel-Gen</h4>\n<p>Using Python, OpenCV and Socket.IO we remove the background of a video stream based on optical flow. This data can then be abstracted into a skeleton and sent back to the frontend. Finally, the frontend can detect if the body intersects the current markers and give the user a point. State is stored on the server meaning many clients are supported (more bus stops woo!!)</p>\n<h4>User-Match</h4>\n<p>Using NodeJS, Express and Socket.IO we match users at bus stops around the world. The first person to hit 10 perfect moves wins the game and, I'm afraid, the other loses.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Streaming HD video over Websockets is hard, especially with ~2.5Mbps upload. We instead segmented the video into important regions, reducing the data requirements by ~ 50x. We also send back a skeleton model that is significant smaller than a video feed, allowing a smooth gameplay experience.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Game state is shared between clients seamlessly, we've achieved relatively accurate skeletal tracking with only a single web cam, we've accounted for both portrait and landscape screens and webcams and we've generated BPM matched mix tapes using the free tier Deezer API.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Websockets, EJS, Computer Vision, Python and a million other things!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Bus Off</h2>\n<p>Let's get integrated in billboards and bus stops around the world, why not integrate this with Twitter? Send an embarrassing video of you and your new best friend dancing.

Therefore we decided to combine AI and health tracks and create an AI bot interface for fetching data from Kanta. It can be used in many kind of purposes, but for the sake of simplicity, we made a user case example for pregnant women. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It will guide you thru pregnancy. You can ask to get your weight or latest lab tests from MyKanta. You can also use it to check your pregnancy state and important days based on dates found at MyKanta. You can also write medicines, symptoms and other stuff and it will give you information if there is something available. You can also type some simple sentences like \"i am bleeding\" or \"i feel sick\" and it tries to figure out what is happening. </p>\n<p>The bot already recognizes almost 200 words (about 120 lab values with baselines), some sentences, severe conditions and pregnancy stages.  </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created Microsoft bot in Azure environment. While Tuomas learned and developed the AI bot, Timo build a pregnancy database and integrated FHIR to the project. We used php + c# for programming, Mysql for data storage and our own servers for hosting. Also we sipped lots of Nocco. And coffee. </p>\n<p>Thanks to Microsoft's brilliant bot framework, the bot works on multiple platforms including Skype and FB.</p>\n<p>We generated our own chat-api that can be found at <a href=\"http://www.fudbot.com/chat-api.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.fudbot.com/chat-api.php</a></p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Well, there is only two of us, so compared to many other teams, we needed to work extra hard. We also wanted to get some sleep and our apartment is at Westend, so timetable was tight for us. We also had some problems with Finnish FHIR server and final night we needed to switch to on in Canada (<a href=\"http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fhirtest.uhn.ca/</a>). Standards are still the same, but we needed to create our demo patient again. </p>\n<p>Also, FHIR and HL7 documentation is... all but logical and meant for humans. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>With team of two, we still managed to deliver a demo. We have never used Microsoft bots, Azure or even MyKanta before, but we managed to take over 'em all. We also made our own pregnancy knowledge database during weekend to use along MyKanta and other stuff. And nevertheless we ran out of time, we managed to learn our bot to had some actual AI. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>That if we want, we can achieve a lot during couple of days. However, we also learned that there is always problems when it comes to developing. Always. </p>\n<h2>What's next for MyKantaPregnancyBot</h2>\n<p>We would like to make the actual and full MyKanta implementation and expand this project for wider purposes. There is still a lot to do, for example, at this point you can't save thru bot. We wanted to make some data analytics but we simply didn't have time to do so. We do have some classes for predictive analysis already done so we can actually use this to lifestyle guidance purposes. We will also use this project as a demo of our service at Slush. We will integrate this to our own service among any others so we can generate risk models for gestational diabetes based on MyKanta data.  </p>\n<p>And we would like to integrate Microsoft Face API for recognizing user. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a

\u201cbottleneck\u201d of future mobility development is a lack of actual on-line information about available parking places and parking rules in big cities like Helsinki.\nWe are developing an <strong>application for parking cars on free of charge parking places (smart parking disc)</strong> and a service for the <strong>analyzing of parking events and parking places</strong>:</li>\n<li>For drivers it is a convenient mobile application for parking their cars, with a reminder about parking time out, and a navigation to the parking place. </li>\n<li>Mobile application for parking wardens provides access to information about parking events (when and where it is started and finished). API will enable the possibility for automation of their work (Parking Events API).</li>\n<li>Parking events statistics (time, duration, place) is used for collecting data about  parking places, providing on-line information about their capacity, forecasting available parking slots at some time-stamp (Parking Places API).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We have already implemented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic functionality of Android mobile application for parking cars.

Instant checkout is performed via P2P money transfer system upon the rent end.\nCommunication between car owners and renters is performed using in-app messenger.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Experts call CarBuddy \"Airbnb for cars\" :-)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>CarBuddy is a prototype of fully automated (keyless) P2P \u0421arsharing platform based on Remoto (smart car OBD-dongle and GPS-tracker), Embers (smart parking sensors) and TransferWise (money transfer between owners and renters).

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyday we define ourselves from the rest with our actions, choosing particular outfit over another or listening to certain kinds of music. We wanted to optimize the already existing recommendation systems to help users find the clothes and outfits their points of reference are wearing. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Tant suggests tailored clothing offers to its users by analysing their presence in Deezer and Instagram. The app is integrated with Zalando\u2019s Shop API to facilitate the purchase of the desired clothes. \nThe onboarding to the app is very simple since it consists of a 3-field form (gender, age and country) and the login to either the user\u2019s Instagram and/or Deezer account. When the user is ready to run Tant, our algorithm calls Zalando\u2019s Shop API to scrape all the brands in stock, then analyses the shopper\u2019s presence on the previously mentioned platforms and returns the most suitable pieces of apparel. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>To build Tant, we\u2019ve chosen Zalando\u2019s Shop API, Deezer\u2019s API and Instagram\u2019s API to develop our core service. Go has been adopted as backend language using BeeGo as the preferred framework since it helps us cut down the developing time. The development of the frontend has been carried out using HTML, CSS and JavaScript as core languages. Radix has been kind enough to offer us the domain tant.store for free but the site is hosted in our own server. To browse the web, we\u2019ve used Azure Cognitive Services as search API to fetch all the information regarding the artists.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into several challenges while developing and deploying the project. The fact of linking 2 different concepts (music and clothing) supposed a series of product design challenges until we reached the final breakthrough. On the one hand we had a trouble with Deezer\u2019s authentication library that didn\u2019t work properly with Go\u2019s OAuth. On the other hand, Instagram forces you to verify the application you are willing to develop, this implies a series of limitations regarding the calls to their API. In order to solve this issue we had to hack our way by using less elegant ways of achieving our goals, bypassing their sandbox environment as much as we could.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the fact of being able to link 2 concepts that might seem so distant conceptually speaking and blend them seamlessly in one product that is ready to use as it is.

Refining the current version of the algorithm to eliminate false positives and improve the results displayed at the moment. \nNext stages of development would include implementing a social feature to share outfits and music preferences allowing us to build a larger and richer graph that would greatly improve our recommendation system.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.tant.store\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.tant.store</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/zalando\">zalando</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/deezer\">deezer</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/instagram\">instagram</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Jarvis", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHCjT0kqaYE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jarvis \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/285/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Slide_01</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jarvis \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/676/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Slide_02</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jarvis \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/288/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Slide_03</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jarvis \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/286/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Slide_04</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Online shopping is around for quit a long time, but it always was impersonal. Online retailers sell clothing not knowing us and never seen us! Nobody can honestly say: Dude, this is not your color. It is just you and the web-site. And once clicked on some item, you will be seeing it on your facebook as suggested promo FOREVER until you finally buy it.</p>\n<p>We created Jarvis - the smart assistant who can scientifically select clothing for online customers using neural networks. All you need is to make a selfie so AI could recognize your unique type of person. After that, Jarvis will create the avatar that looks like you - same hair color,  skin tone, eyes colors. But you can also adjust it as well. \nThen you can choose what type of style you are looking for and Jarvis will find items on online shops that can be well-combined and will be perfect on you. Jarvis makes a job as a professional stylist. Because he knows what colors are good or bad for any unique person. </p>\n<p>The benefits of using this App:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can be sure that clothing you buy will be good on you.</li>\n<li>You click only on items you like and in the future, you also will like all targeting advertisement. </li>\n<li>You will be confident when buying clothing, and retailers will be suggesting correct items and as a result selling more. </li>\n<li>Everybody happy and stylish. \nIt is time for successful online shopping.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How we did it.\nDuring the hackathon we labeled about 50 faces (each of them has about 20 photos) and prepared dataset.

Unfortunately, there's one manner which is we need the Internet all the time. Not having access to the Internet means no knowledge and information. Unfortunately, most of the people in the world don't have access to the Internet. That's why I created NIC SDK (HTTP over SMS).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>NIC SDK recognize if user has the Internet access or not. If user has the Internet access, NIC calls your API and you get the data. If the user doesn't have internet access, that's where the magic happens. NIC SDK will get request, parse it, and send SMS to NIC servers, and return the data you need as SMS.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>In this hackathon, I couldn't manage to build a team, and I did all the parts alone. I built backend part to handle SMS and parse them as request, and I build customized SMS Manager for Android, to deal with incoming data. Moreover, I built one demo app which let's you Transfer Money via TransferWise without Internet access. You can access video demo below.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There was problems with integrating transferwise api and 46elks api. However, I could solve problems to show working demo.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I made base of platform that let's people to connect to the internet any time.

Imagine that you are a freelancer and earn your salary in Ether (or any other crypto currency) - with our service you'll be able to spend this Ether on many e-commerce sites. You no longer need conventional money to buy goods.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our service translates prices on e-commerce sites from conventional currencies to cryptocurrencies, on the fly, transparently for the customers. A user can add items to the basket, just like he would normally do, and then proceed to checkout. The user will then make the payment in Ether through our plugin app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a dockerized micro services infrastructure, hosted on the Azure cloud. Our solution includes such components, as: Ether blockchain node, Redis, Nodejs, ngrok, and many other components.\nOnce the user reaches the payment stage on the ecommerce site, he lands on our plugin app where a QR code is generated. Scanning the code with the Ether mobile app makes the payment. The transaction with the e-commerce site is handled by our service. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was really interesting and tough to build and run an Ether blockchain node, mainly because of the size of the block itself. We also had to orchestrate many different microservices and components to work together, which was particularly challenging to properly confiure. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We actually got the prototype working. We made an amazing team and collaboration was key to productivity and success. It was an enriching experience, where we all learned new things and shared knowledge with each other</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use docker, how to work with Ether, send and receive payments.

We started walking around at the venue until we stumbled upon JCDecaux's bus stop. Seeing the endless possibilities of providing entertainment to bored waiting people, we immediately knew this was the right challenge for us. We were still spurring out ideas about the bus stop while we walked on to the very other side of the building, where we found out about the presence of Zalando. Combining the many high tech impulses around us with the technological views of Zalando really opened our eyes. We were facinated by the fact that the challenges of JCDecaux and Zalando could be combined, which we think is a very strong cornerstone of Junction. </p>\n<p>Our society is rapidly changing and the traditional way of advertising clearly can not keep up with it. We saw an opportunity to shift from static advertising to dynamic advertising. The idea of ADDY was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We are introducing ADDY, a revolutionary way of advertising. ADDY is a smart screen that invites passers-by to interact with its technology, in order to bring a new fun way of advertising to the market. At the moment someone walks past the screen, the camera shifts on and ADDY seeks to get attention from the person. Whenever attention is gained, ADDY tells the person to come closer. If they do come come closer, an outline of a face is shown. Should the person fit their head in the outline, they will be told that it is soon getting cold and that they should be wearing a scarf.</p>\n<p>Before they even know it, they're suddenly wearing an actual scarf from Zalando! Well, not actually, of course it is projected like that on the screen. Nice comments like \"looking good!\" are popping up and the users will be stunned by their own looks, they have become the Zalando models they have always aspired to be. Besides experiencing this fun and unexpected turn, people will have more incentives to actually buy the scarf. The price is shown thanks to the Zalando API. After a countdown of 3 to 0, a \"picture\" is taken, meaning the screen will freeze for a moment, after which you can step back and enjoy what you had just been through.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We faced multiple technical challenge when developing ADDY. We used a C-based Computer Vision library written in Javascript (source: <a href=\"https://github.com/liuliu/ccv\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/liuliu/ccv</a>) in combination with an HTML5/CSS3 web interface. We had to distinguish between moving people (who walk past the screen) and watching people (who actually look at the screen). For this, we used motion detection and face recognition. When motion is observed, certain (tracking) overlays are added to a live webcam feed (designed in a HTML5 canvas element) which trigger the attention of the person. When a face is observed, another (tracking) overlay is added. The overlay, in this case, will be a product which needs to be advertised. Our plan was to integrate the ESA API so different scenario's could be chosen according to the weather (so, if it is cold in 1 week, a scarf will be shown; if it the sun will shine, sunglasses will be shown) but we didn't have any time left. For now we have integrated the Zalando API to fetch a scarf from the database and overlay this so that it seems like the person is wearing it.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>To make the concept as clear as possible since we found that it added value to both the customer and the businesses which will be using ADDY. The biggest challenge is to convey a clear message.</p>\n<p>A technical challenge we ran into: We've found that the JS library are quite useful to develop an MVP (Minimum viable product) to do some tests and show a demo. However, when developing for production faster and more reliable libraries are needed. JS wasn't enough to make all the complex calculations which left the overlays rather jerky.</p>\n<p>Another technical challenge we ran into was the amount of light that was displayed in the testing space around the bus stop. Because of all the lights, it was difficult to recognize faces and thus place the scarf correctly. We tackled this by turning as many lights off as possible, and therefore creating an environment in which it was possible to film the interaction at least once. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have noticed that at a lot of hackathons, many of the ideas are incredibly fun or amazingly programmed but simply not feasible. We are proud of the fact that we have taken lots of time to work out the business model of ADDY, and that it is actually very clear to see how ADDY can be a valuable addition to the world of marketing. During the process, we spoke to people from JCDecaux and Zalando regularly. They made us realize that the business model is very important as businesses need viable ideas in order to survive in the market. </p>\n<p>We are also very pleased to have a working prototype of a concept we've been brainstorming on for a very long time during the hackathon. The idea we are presenting seems quite futuristic, we believe. One partner we spoke to about our concept proclaimed he had never heard of anything like it, maybe only once in a science fiction movie in a distant memory.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The number of people that are reached by an advertisement is enormous, yet they are perceived as boring or worthless. This made us wonder why such an innovation as ADDY has never been done before. And frankly... we don't know? We do know that a fairly simple technological solution may have a massive impact on society. ADDY may change the marketing world as we know it, simply because the scene can use a lot of improvements.</p>\n<p>Last but not least; we have learned a lot about the Finnish culture. We are all from The Netherlands and we've been accepted warmly (I wish this was about the weather) into the community. Some culture differences had sent us on the wrong track at the beginning. We have learned that Finnish people are shy out in public, which has forced us to make decisions that have turned out to be quite okay actually! For example we heard that Finnish people would not do big interactions in front of a big screen when other people are around. This is why we also decided we did not want to make use of the touchscreen, even though it's an amazing addition to the specifications of the screen.</p>\n<h2>Meet The Team</h2>\n<p>Bas Schleijpen - Bas likes to jump into the shower when deadlines are near. When he is dried up, he's a skilled code writer.\nJoris van Rijn - This man's smooth jacket and classy shoes say it all: Joris is ready to rock the hell out of Junction. And he sure will.\nCorn\u00e9 van Son - Corn\u00e9 had successfully infiltrated the Junction crew prior to the event. He's a man who sets out goals, and then crushes them.\nGustavo Leal - Gus loves to sleep. A lot. Whenever he is awake though, he's an amazing artwork and interface designer.\nBert van Gestel - Bert loves to walk around, talking to all sorts of hackers and relevant partners. This slimy talk results into slimy pitches.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ADDY</h2>\n<p>We will see where it goes after this hackathon; hopefully our idea will be recognized by the companies we ought it valuable for. In this way we can for example integrate the ESA API to create content to give very accurate weather predictions along with products that might protect people from bad weather. </p>\n<p>Our demo was just about Zalando, however there's an endless list of all sorts of companies, whether they are local or global, that can severely profit from ADDY's services. But there's even more purposes for ADDY to serve than just companies: think about charities, raising awareness for issues, educational purposes. Again, the possibilities are beyond imagination.</p>\n<p>The demo was also just limited to bus stops. But why only bus stops? These screens can be placed anywhere. Busy shopping areas, airports, hospitals, schools, supermarkets, and the list goes on and on. This is an idea that could grow out to be a very important player in the world of marketing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://experimenting.tech/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://experimenting.tech/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>experimenting.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["PhoenixJourney", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhoenixJourney \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/078/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Main Game Scene</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhoenixJourney \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/081/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Main Menu</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhoenixJourney \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/083/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>\"Game Over\" Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PhoenixJourney \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/084/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>\"Resurrection\"</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to follow the theme of the jam, \u201cResurrection\u201d, but we wanted to be unconventional. Respawning was the first idea, but it was also something that anybody could think of. We thought we could do better.\nThe first ideas went towards procedural generation. Resurrect as something different every time, maybe. But that would have just been a regular rogue-like.\nThen we thought about the elements of the game. We brainstormed and came up with the conclusion that characters and settings are a big part of what makes a game a GOOD game.\nWhat character can we associate to resurrection? And we thought: the Phoenix! And what settings can we associate with it? An endless fly towards the sun, to be able to resurrect from its own ashes. Ockham\u2019s Razor. It\u2019s so simple, yet so special. Simple characters, simple game mechanics. All of it wrapped in a beautiful environment and a fly towards what cannot be reached by mortals. Modern Daedalus and Icarus.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Phoenix Journey is a mobile procedurally generated endless runner game focused on the small details that make things great.\nYou play as the Phoenix and fly towards your goals, avoiding obstacles and dodging traps. In the meantime, you pick up what you earn in your path.\nObstacles are inevitable at some point. As a Phoenix, though, you have a second chance. You can resurrect. Try to get to the point where you restore your life. But with a time limit.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We broke down the main tasks and each one of us chose the ones that they preferred to work on. We kept a Spreadsheet with all tasks and bug to track. We set up a BitBucket repository to be able to cooperate and speed up our work.</p>\n<h2>Assets used</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/44205\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/44205</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/37457\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/37457</a></li>\n<li>all sounds are from <a href=\"https://www.freesound.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.freesound.org/</a></li>\n<li>music track is from <a href=\"http://www.newgrounds.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.newgrounds.com/</a></li>\n<li>some particle textures were done beforehand by Sini (our team member)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Satisfy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Satisfy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Armata\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Armata</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we ran into was managing the time optimally in order to make up for missing one of our team mates! - who got sick on Friday night. We planned our tasks and organised our schedule to complete the project within the deadline, allowing a slot of time for polishing and debugging - which, we realised, was fundamental.\nA big challenges was coming up with an original idea and an entertaining gameplay. We had plenty of ideas but some of them, for a reason or another, were not feasible for a game jam. We still decided to aim high. In the end, we managed to complete our project, even if ambitious.\nAnother one of the challenges was putting up with the difficulty of more people working on the same Game Scene given that the project was set up in a repository. We split up our own changes into personal Test Scenes and our Game Designer managed to merge everything together.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of having made a great team and also a game that we are happy with! We didn't know each others so agreeing on most things could have been challenging, but luckily we all had pretty much the same views!\nWe are proud of having managed to complete the game, even if we considered it ambitious - aim to the sun!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt a bunch about version control! Some merges were hard to handle but we did it!\nSome of us didn't have experience with Unity and managed to contribute a huge lot. We learnt about animations and how important details can be. We learnt a lot about GUIs and Unity assets.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PhoenixJourney</h2>\n<p>We would love to develop the game further into many different levels! We think the PhoenixJourney has potential and Android/iOS are great platforms to support it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitbucket\">bitbucket</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sourcetree</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">krita</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/AlexRDev/hillomunkit/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/AlexRDev/hillomunkit/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2bteV46YnWWWWZWRUw4YjFWQXM/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2bteV46YnWWWWZWRUw4YjFWQXM/view?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Unity, C#, menus and GUI, testing, Android, ideas", "Art direction, character from design to final asset, particle effects, level design", "", ""]], ["WalkieTalkie", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>IMPORTANT</h2>\n<p>Table number: <strong>D18</strong></p>\n<p>Primary Track: <strong>AI</strong></p>\n<p>Secondary Track: <strong>GameJam</strong></p>\n<p>Partner challenges: <strong>Skype</strong> <strong>Azure</strong> <strong>GameJam</strong> <strong>In-store conversion supercharged</strong> <strong>Jelastic</strong></p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>All of us are fans of books.

For example when the users mention an email about a topic, it can go through a mailbox analyze the emails to understand which one the users were referring to and display the relevant one in chat. Similarly it is integrated with cloud storage and return images based on what is displayed on them.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We will bring the way of visualization to the next level and help UPM differentiating from the competition by using latest 3D technology with Mixed Reality. We were inspired by the possibilities of <em>Microsoft HoloLens</em>, 3D models in Virtual Reality and new ways of interaction between humans and machines.</p>\n<p>We are convinced, by using the <strong>HoloAstic Transport Visualization</strong> <em>(HoloAstic = HoloLens + Fantastic)</em> UPM will save money and increase customer loyalty by improving delivery reliability. The daily work on tracking orders is easier to understand and options for decision making are vastly improved. We have calculated a rough business case, and can show that our solution will save more than** 1.2 Million \u20ac annually**.</p>\n<p>Our solution includes two extensions to the HoloAstic Transport Visualization to create a complete ecosystem:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Solution Module 1: Transport Prediction - A calculation engine</p></li>\n<li><p>Solution Module 2: Delivery Tracker - A simple mobile app for truck drivers</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We are using the transport data from <em>IBM Bluemix</em>, enhancing it with additional transport information and external data and our solution visualizes the data on a 3D world map.</p>\n<p>The world map is showing ALL ongoing transports and orders of UPM. An indicator (RED, GREEN) shows critical transports. By using voice commands, the user is able to choose one customers and reduce the data according to his selection. </p>\n<p>In addition gesture and speech enables the user to drill down to a specific order / transport. Detailed information (product, grade, estimated time of arrival, ...) is shown to get more insights. Alternative transport methods are shown if applicable and simulations are calculated how Estimated Time to Arrival can be kept.</p>\n<p>In addition a UPM employee can invite q customer to join the session. Customer and UPM employees will be able to collaborate and deciding on the best alternatives to reach the original estimated time of arrival. In our use case, there are multiple alternatives - truck, ship and train. By clicking on the alternative route, the data will be transferred back to be Back-End.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Our Solution consist of the following parts</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Main Solution: consists of full 3D visualization showing a top down view of all UPM transports</p></li>\n<li><p>Module 1: transport prediction will merge real time data and historical data to calculate exact arrival times</p></li>\n<li><p>Module 2: the delivery tracker, a mobile app, allows drivers to update the delivery status in real time. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>First we analysed the available data and discussed the different data models with UPM and Bluemix experts. Then we created paper prototypes to design the flow necessary to visualize the data.</p>\n<p>Finally we design all necessary 3D models (earth, truck, ship, train) and made them interactive. In parallel we have integrated the Bluemix APIs to include original UPM data directly in our solution.</p>\n<p>Technology used was: Microsoft Hololens, Cross Platform Development Tools, SketchUp, Unitiy 3D, Git, Visual Studio, C#, ...</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Collaboration: We had challenges to share our code with GIT. Solved.</p>\n<p>Data model: The data was not very easy to understand. Some adaptions were necessary to make the data usable. </p>\n<p>Complexity of 3D models. It took us a lot of time to create 3D models and then reduce the complexity of all models to ensure good performance.</p>\n<p>Availability of WLAN: As we have an online application transferring a large amount of data, it was sometimes very hard to get it running because WLAN was N/A.</p>\n<p>UI/UX Design: We invested a lot into the interaction between Human and the 3D Models. This is why our UX Designer tested several ways in prototypes before we started implementation.</p>\n<p>Our biggest concern, related to presentation is the weak WLAN which might  cause performance problems. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>The whole solution created by our team. We did not expect to get it running within the short time. We managed to divide the roles in the team very clearly and work effective.</p>\n<p>Back-End, Front-End, Visuals, UX, Preparation of Pitch, ...</p>\n<p><strong>HoloAstic Transport Visualization</strong> is is the very first solution on Microsoft HoloLens that allow easy analysis of transport status and logistics for the paper industry, specially customized to  UPM needs. </p>\n<p>It is also possible to run the <strong>HoloAstic Transport Visualization</strong> on different devices like Mobile, Desktop - cross platform</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Teambulding, UPM\u2019s business and logistic processes and to make a simple visualization for it.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>What's next for HoloAstic Transport Visualization</h2>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>We need to extend the use case. Of course it was not possible to make all data in all variants available in the Hololens Solution in such a short time. </p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Extend the use case with new scenarios</p></li>\n<li><p>Increase amount of dynamic data and the visualization of it</p></li>\n<li><p>Increase customer collaboration capabilities</p></li>\n<li><p>Add additional calculations and predictions for transports</p></li>\n<li><p>Add Decision Support functionalities</p></li>\n<li><p>Remote Guidance with Skype or other tools (e.g. with Truck driver, loading,

What we know for sure after one-year experience in competitions: best apps come from people\u2019s everyday troubles. Firstly, we touched the floor with getting rid of annoying consultants at shop places. They often come not in the right time and disappear when we need them. Then we combined it with IOT and after receiving feedback from amazing partners (TEMPCOMP and Kesko - both) we came to the final idea, which profits customers and stores at the same time.</p>\n<h2>What it does?</h2>\n<p>CashMesh is a Bluetooth sensor network, combined with store lighting system. It allows tracking user movements inside shop facility and provides him with a small handy hintME! button to call consultants when customer really needs them. For sales person it displays all up-to-date information about products, special offers and troubled customer position in store. \nBased on customers\u2019 movement throughout time, CashMesh utilizes Microsoft Azure to make a \u201cheatmap\u201d of store facility area to identify and optimize production placement for even better conversion. </p>\n<h2>How we built it?</h2>\n<p>The hintME! is a thin smartcard with one button and Bluetooth module. For tests we used Raspbery Pi3 with powerbank module and a button, assembled in a 3d-printed case.\nWe viewed a lot of manuals and read half of Stackoverflow to find a viable technical option to build our product on. A mesh network of smart bulbs was built with help of Casambi modules (smart Bluetooth module from TEMPCOMP), iBeacons build in it and some Arduino units.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>First challenge was to design a complex system, which can incorporate our vision in both appropriate hardware and software. \nOur team is rather experienced with hardware and embedded programming along with mechanical design and fast prototyping. However, we didn\u2019t have a good frontend guy, so that was rather crucial challenge at the hackathon beginning.\nDuring the hack we had to make sure we have accurate coordinates of each shop customers, which was a rather hard task considering iBeacons tolerance. </p>\n<h2>Acomplishments</h2>\n<p>We did a good job, because TempComp hardware was a real hard nut to crack. Nevermind, we could overcome all challenges and build a MVP with the best possible characteristics in this hackathon setting. \nWe made an awesome frontend design, providing landing, salesman app  and marketing heatmap pages.</p>\n<h2>What we learned?</h2>\n<p>Improved fast code prototyping from complete scratch, boosted our social skills (found an excellent frontend guy) and refined our market understanding.</p>\n<h2>Future steps for CashMesh</h2>\n<p>We really hope, that we will reach hearts and help to solve realworld problems that are still a burden for challenges providers.

Hate speech hurts minorities.</p>\n<p>Fake news sites are at the heart of this all. They are known for spreading hate speech, committing fraud, copyright offenses, and most of all, creating confusion and distrust towards legitimate news outlets. If you do not trust anything you read anymore, you have fallen victim to fake news. We want to make you trust again.</p>\n<p>Fake news overpowering real news is a growing problem for social media giants. Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc. are searching for a solution how to tackle this problem. </p>\n<p>We want to provide a fact-checked, transparent, reliable, comprehensive, and up-to-date data on Fake News Sites through an API for everyone to use. We will recognize fake news for you.</p>\n<p>Our solution can be used to, for example, create apps for the consumer, or as supporting data source for building newsfeed algorithms in social media services. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We have created a service that recognizes fake news. You can give an URL (or URLs) of a webpage to our API, and it will tell you if it is a fake news article.</p>\n<p>The api calls are very simple: http://[server]/fakenews/?url=firsturl&amp;url=secondurl</p>\n<p>The response also contains information on where the fake news classification originated from (which shows who/what classified it as fake and why it is fake). Reliability of the data, as well as transparency, are the key in providing this service. As important as it is knowing which are fake news, is why they are classifies as fake news.</p>\n<p>To showcase a possible use case for the fake news API we have also created a browser extension for Chrome. This extension will highlight and warn you of links that point to fake news sites, for example in your Facebook feed.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used Python and Django Rest Framework for providing the API.</p>\n<p>The Chrome extension was written on JavaScript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Bugs in the code created by ourselves. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>Teamwork! Also we felt that we created something meaningful, current, and possibly commercially viable.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned about the scale of the fake news and hate speech phenomenona, and how they are affecting our society.</p>\n<p>We have learned to use new technologies, neither of us had experience of Django Rest Framework or writing browser extensions.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HAPI - Hate Speech and Fake News API</h2>\n<p>We have now created a simple prototype that proves that the idea works. </p>\n<p>The big picture (see picture) is that we want to have a classification system based on machine learning that will suggest new possible fake news sites or hate speech sites that could be added to our database. </p>\n<p>What  we have in line next:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the technological solution (it's a prototype, it ain't pretty)</li>\n<li>Commercialization of the API: Freemium model where a limited rate will be available for free for everyone to use, heavy duty use costs money.

Our database has been created from the fake news site listing in Fake News Watch website (<a href=\"http://www.fakenewswatch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fakenewswatch.com/</a>).

Instead, we had a scale at Amsterdam, where we had to wait five hours until the next plane. We wanted to visit Amsterdam, but we hadn't planned it an we didn't have much time. This inspired us to build this useful app.</p>\n<h1> What it does: </h1>\n<p>The app provides you with a tour shown in a map adjusted to your budget and your limited time.\nThousands of travellers have faced the following situation: Should I stay to the airport, or can I go to visit the city in the few hours I have until the next plane takes off?! Usually the answer is to stay in the airport because we don't want to lose the plane. \nOur app is here to change that! Just introduce at what hour do you want to start the express tour and when and where do you want to finish it. Also provide your budget, and we will take you over the most awesome parts of the city making sure you're on time for your duties. The app will also suggest you some nice place to eat, always adapted to your wallet.</p>\n<h1> How we built it: </h1>\n<p>We've worked in a completely cross platform environment (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows), and built an app for iOS, Android and the web. To do that we've coded in python and used deveo to synchronise our work. \nWe've integrated a bunch of APIs to get the data we needed, most of them are open. We've developed our first version of the app just for Barcelona, because it's a city that we love, and it have some awesome open data provided by the administration. Some of the data that we get from there are: points of interest, activities, museums,...However, not all the information that we needed was open so, we've also used close data sets from Foursquare and Google.</p>\n<p><strong>Open Data sets:</strong>\n<a href=\"http://opendata.bcn.cat/opendata/es/catalog/CULTURA_I_OCI/agendacultural/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cultural Agenda of Barcelona</a>,\n    <a href=\"http://opendata.bcn.cat/opendata/es/catalog/ext/TURISME/puntsinformacioturistica/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Points of Interest of Barcelona</a>,\n    <a href=\"http://dades.eicub.net/api/1/museusexposicions-inventari\" rel=\"nofollow\">Museums of Barcelona</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Close Data sets:</strong>\n<a href=\"https://developer.foursquare.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foursquare</a>,\n    <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/places/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Places</a>,\n    <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/?hl=es-419\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Maps</a>.</p>\n<h1> Challenges we ran into </h1>\n<p>The biggest challenge we faced was finding and integrating all the data we thought that was necessary. Because we combined very different sources, but we needed to work with all of them as equal. \nWe wanted to have a nice looking product but we didn't have a designer in our team, and we wanted to have it in both smartphone and desktop screens. So we put a lot of effort and work in the design and the front end.</p>\n<h1> Accomplishments that we're proud of </h1>\n<p>We're really proud of the overall result because we think that we've come with a product that can be enjoyed for many tourists. The app also shown us some places of Barcelona that looks so interesting and we don't even know after living there for so many years. </p>\n<h1> What we learned </h1>\n<p>Some members of the team had no previous knowledge of web developing or python, and now feel confortable working on it. Other members have learn how to teach and still being able to progress on their responsibilities.</p>\n<h1> What's next for notMy.site </h1>\n<p>The following steps for us are going global and offer this service world wide instead of just in Barcelona. But not just that, we want to collect tons of data from the users, and integrate more services and information. To give the user a unique experience, and let them have a great time where before they just had a boring idle time. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">open-data</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/deveo\">deveo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://notmy.site\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://notmy.site\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>notmy.site</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I've been collecting data from the APIs", "I have developed the backend functionalities, collecting data and computing the best route possible.", "I developed and designed the hybrid application, as well as defining the product with my team colleagues."]], ["eyeServant", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3g23cwyC5nU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Sales Pitch</h2>\n<p>Ever felt too lazy to pick up your stuff from across the room? Ever dreamt of having your own personal butler? Are you tired of robots having complex interfaces with scary buttons and crave something simpler?  Well, dream no more \u2013 the future is here! With the help of our eyeServant you can grab something and have it delivered to you with just a glance of an eye. Look at the object you need and then look again at the place where you want it delivered \u2013 and the eyeServant will do all your work for you. You will never need to leave your comfy couch again!</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the eternal human laziness. Nothing to be ashamed of, we just say it as it is. Humans go the great lengths to save themselves some unwanted effort \u2013 and we aim to help them to do so. </p>\n<p>But jokes aside, the main purpose of the solution is to help people with limited mobility in their everyday lives in a truly simple and unintimidating way.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The goal was to control the Baxter robot with the Tobii EyeX eyetracker and make it move objects from one place to another. The user would look at the object and then look at the destination where the object should be placed \u2013 and consequently the robot would do all the work for the user and move the object.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>However, we ran into some challenges while trying to communicate with the robot. It turned out that the robot we were using came with the wrong firmware (the manufacturing firmware instead of the research firmware) and ultimately we could not control the robot via commands from the computer. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Instead we pre-programmed sequence of movements via the robot interface. Then we created the Unity program that reads the data from the eyetracker and checks what is the user looking at. If the user looks at one of the marked spots (marked specially in the Unity app for the purpose of the presentation), the signal is sent from the computer, via the Arduino board, to the Baxter robot, and as a result Baxter performs the next movement from the sequence. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re very proud of the effects of our work \u2013 even though we ran into some technical difficulties while connecting to the robot, we managed to find a workaround allowing us to create the demo of the system. Those dirty hacks are what you are usually the most proud of at the end of any hackaton. :)</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that if you see the biggest, the most expensive toy/hardware on the hackaton, always dare to ask to work with it \u2013 someone might just say yes. But seriously, we learned a lot about the Baxter robot (and about its different firmware variants) and how it can be programmed.

But the most important thing that is affected when you wake up low on quality sleep is your motivation and planing.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Omoura uses data from the Oura ring and uses it to motivate you accordingly and helps you plan your day better and more effectively. Omoura is based on the minimally invasive design philosophy where in the mobile app provides you motivational clues and suggestions for re-planning your day based on your calendar data for the day.</p>\n<h2>The Scientific Basis</h2>\n<p><em>\"If your lowest resting heart rate occurs during the night at a later time than usual, that can be a sign of an increased need for recovery or that you are sleeping at too high a temperature in your room.\"</em> - <strong>Ben Greenfield</strong>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xu-w9UGoWT7cjJ4uVNaetm35D-Z_jugFGB2uglxHYNg/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Read more</a></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Since Omura is based on minimally invasive design philosophy, we don't talk much about your actual statistics from Oura ring. <em>We make sense of them, for you.</em>\nOmoura primarliy uses the Readiness Score from your previous night's Oura ring data and does a series of further checks if it discovers that you are in the RED. It then checks your personal calendar data for the current day and presents you motivational quotes and re-planning suggestions such as - go easy on work, skip work altogether or then use the weekend to catch up on some quality sleep if it is the weekend.

Fancy coffee cups can be rather frustrating. Alright, Mac is indeed a little cool\". _</p>\n<h2>What's next for OMOURA</h2>\n<p>Omoura is a humble beginning to a rather ambitious \"Health Assistant\" app. \nWe plan to have a Omoura's own cloud platform that pulls relevant content for you based on your sleep and readiness data for the last night. Picture this: \nYou wake up with not such a good night's sleep. Omura knows from your preferences data that you aren't a \"METAL\" soul and would like to have a light and easy start to the day. Omura cloud based platform gets you the latest inspirational news pieces in the order of their relevant reactions from other Facebook users using the Facebook Reactions API. And in the meantime, until you're ready for the bad news, we can keep the News about the US's new president elect, The Donald, away from your sensitive eyes and brain. \nOmura also plans to be a recommender system for health and wellness related products, a good current example of which is the Paulig Muki, that presents relevant quotes to the Omoura user based on his sleep data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">oura-cloud-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muki</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CardoKambla/Omoura\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CardoKambla/Omoura\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Tried to make sense of the data from Oura API and researched around for more relevant variables that determine sleep quality.

Uniquely, only the opponent of the player is shown on the map \u2014 the player can figure out he's own location by himself. State-of-the-art microlocation technology is used to make this possible. </p>\n<p>The story is about a tribe of skilled demon-hunters hunting poor persons occupied by the resurrecting demons. </p>\n<p>The match-making is done by the server. The player's goal is to get near the opponent undetected, and fire the weapon (no aiming required) first when near enough. The trick is to detect the opponent from the crowd as early as possible (the one looking around &amp; at his mobile is a good candidate). Then, just approach the target casually (and definitely not staring at the mobile), and BOOM. </p>\n<p>The firing of the weapon causes the weapon, er, I mean the mobile phone to emit a loud BANG, and start a reload timer. Were you too far away? Too bad: you are definitely detected now! Time for some running... If you were near enough (and first to fire), a satisfying \"AAargh!!\" is emitted from the victim's phone, and you emerge as the winner. Alas, the demon is going to resurrect in some other body soon. Get ready for a new fight!</p>\n<p>The game mechanic allows for server-side tracking of players, and, through dynamic match-making, guiding people around. The mobility- and data driven gamification possibilities are innumerable. Want to know what route people choose between points A and B? Check, just give the player at A an opponent near B. (The opponent need not exist to begin with, but do not tell this to the player). Want to get a payer out of your player? Check, just give him a target near the goods he desires. Want to entertain, follow and guide small patients around a hospital. Check, just reskin the app to show a little less killing.</p>\n<p>We made the game with Unity engine on the client, and Cloud Function -microservice-based server in the Azure cloud. The microlocation tech was provided by proximi.io. The biggest challenge (for which we are very proud of) was the development of a Unity plugin for proximi.io service.</p>\n<p>We are also extremely proud of the novel game mechanic. It allows for inaccurate positioning (not to make finding the opponent too easy) and bad connections (ditto, and in the case of complete failure of opponent connection, the demon just resurrects into some other player nearby). The story, the tech challenges &amp; possibilities, the theme of the jam and the game mechanic support each other uniquely! The same goes for (commercial) gamification possibilities: the story supports dynamic changing of opponents to satisfy the needs of the service provider.</p>\n<p>Of course, building a complete client-server architecture for a location-based PvP game in such a short timeframe is quite a feat in itself. Not to mention writing these pitches last-minute, staying awake overnight or whatnot.</p>\n<p>While there were many technologies we were familiar with to begin with (e.g. Unity, Azure cloud services), we had to learn some Android coding, proximi.io SDK and how to code &amp; build challenging Unity plugins with native components.</p>\n<p>Above all, we had great fun and feeling of accomplishment. We formed a great team; although most of the team works for the same company (Next Games), our roles have not allowed for us to work together this intensely before.</p>\n<p>Next, we go on working in our regular jobs (4/5 at Next). We acquired new skills and developed some interesting tech, that might find novel usages in our future products.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">proximi.io</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photshop</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3ds-max\">3ds-max</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nosql</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">documentdb</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/am11/junction2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/am11/junction2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Look For Me!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Look For Me! \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/425/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Please note that this application is aimed for the blind, therefore this contains mainly debugginginformation</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Erwin got the inspiration thinking about how new technology, e.g., advances in Artificial Intelligence and related computer vision developments, can have an impact on people's lives. For most people, advances in technology, especially in the mobile device sector, enhance comfort and deliver entertainment. However, for some, new technology can have a much greater impact on everyday life. </p>\n<p>We started a brainstorming session after we met, under the brainstorming we come up with the idea to develop an application to assist the blind. At the core, we aimed to create a solution which can \u201clook around\u201d, recognize objects, and store this information together with (indoor) location data for later use. Bundled with an easy-to-use voice interface, this would help the blind find the objects in their surroundings.</p>\n<p>Our idea further evolved after reading about the GE Healthcare challenge; \nvoice commands and text-to-speech could also be useful for other groups such as children. \nAt a hospital the children might feel lost or disoriented, we all know that the machines can look really frightening especially for children. \nWe thought that if we made an app to show our young ones what the machines does they might be less frightening. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The application helps the bind people to find objects and their location, especially indoors, without the need for a cane. The only thing the blind person needs is his/her cellphone with our application installed. Currently, our application has these functions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Automatic object recognition. The user takes a photo via our app which then uses an Artificial Intelligence-enhanced vision API to detect objects in the scene. This data is saved together with the position (latitude/longitude as well as a human-readable room name) so that the user can later ask the app about his/her relative location to the seen objects. For our prototype, photos are taken with a manual click. Later, this would happen automatically to keep an up-to-date database of all relevant objects around the user.</p></li>\n<li><p>Look for Me (1). The user can ask questions like \u201cWhere is my guitar\u201d and our app tells him/her the answer based on the previously recorded information, e.g, \u201cIn the Main Hall, about 10 meters left of you.\u201d This helps the user in navigating to the desired object.</p></li>\n<li><p>Look for Me (2). The user can ask questions like \u201cWhat is in front of me?\u201d and our app tells him/her the answer. This is based on indoor beacons which could even allow for dynamic, complex objects like health machines where an object recognition using computer vision is unable to correctly recognize the object. Of course, this feature can help sighted people as well, e.g., children in the aforementioned hospital context with unknown objects.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>After our brainstorming session, we started to discuss how we should develop our application. Neither of the team had developed an application for iOS before, but both Christian and Erwin had written Android applications before so we decided to built our prototype on Android.</p>\n<p>We started by researching APIs for IPS (Indoor positioning system), Image/Object Recognition, voice-recognition, and Text-to-Speech on the first day of Junction 2016.</p>\n<p>On day two we started building our application. \nThe first function we wrote was the object recognition function using Google\u2019s Cloud Vision API together with proximi.io\u2019s (indoor) positioning API. The second one was the voice interface using Android\u2019s Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech features. There, we also implemented functionality that calculated the relative position of an object to the user based on the location of the user and the orientation of his phone.</p>\n<p>Now one hour and 15 minutes before the submission we\u2019re still trying to inprove our application but with no success. After some research we found out that the most common problem for a blind is to find their things. Another problem they often have is to navigate in their home, hotels, venues etc.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was to get all the APIs and other data sources to collaborate with each other. We put in many hours to fix issues related to that. Also, the Android emulator wouldn\u2019t run on Macs so we only had one physical device to prototype on. </p>\n<p>While the indoor positioning API provides high-accuracy results using beacons and even supports so-called departments, e.g., for rooms, it was unable to map location data to department/room names. Therefore, we had to implement our own mapping using polygon geofences for the known departments.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we did not manage to integrate Firebase into our project although we\u2019d have loved to use it for our database.</p>\n<p>Another challenge was to convert between 0 to 360, -180 to 180 and -pi to pi angles with varying interpretations of what is clockwise/counterclockwise was surprisingly annoying. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, we actually managed to build a working prototype of our idea in just about 40 hours.\nThe automatic object recognition via the vision API works rather well for the tested objects, also the (indoor) location data provides accurate enough data.\nOur voice interface is simple to use and, together with the relative location/distance computations, allows the app to \u201clook\u201d for the user and either tell him/her where a desired object is or, e.g., what an object in front of him/her is.</p>\n<p>We managed to work around some limitations of the proximi.io API after talking to their representatives here at Junction. Thanks for your help!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team member Lauri had never used Java or developed for Android before so this was an ideal opportunity to learn the basics.</p>\n<p>We also have learned how to use the Google Cloud Vision API for Image/Object Recognition and Android\u2019s voice features (Speech Recognition/Text-To-Speech). We did also learn about IPS (Indoor positioning system), and therefore wish to acknowledge proximi.io for this opportunity to work with IPS.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Look For Me!</h2>\n<p>Our prototype requires manual action to take photos which were then analyzed using the vision API. We\u2019d like to build an efficient solution which continuously monitors the user\u2019s surroundings to keep up-to-date information on all interesting objects around him/her.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we\u2019d like to implement a local vision API for object recognition so that our app does not depend on an active Internet connection to work. Advances in AI-based object recognition are promising for such an approach.</p>\n<p>Although the indoor positioning has a rather good accuracy, often around 1 meter, we\u2019d like to implement pin-point navigation by using the camera with object recognition continuously. For example, simple \u201cleft\u201d/\u201dright\u201d commands near the searched object can allow the user to find it even easier and faster.</p>\n<p>Finally, we\u2019d like to augment our results with further data. For example, if the user asks about the object in front of him/her, it\u2019d be great if our app would not only tell the object\u2019s name but also other information, e.g., a more detailed description or other (contextual) information.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">proximi.io</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-cloud-vision-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">speech-recoginition</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">texttospeech-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">object-recoginition</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ai</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ibeacons</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/christiannageby/Junction2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/christiannageby/Junction2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["KAFFEED", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We want to enhance all coffee moments by enabling Paulig's <strong>MUKI</strong> to provide its user the content feed they desire.

Our solution efficiently tackles the aforementioned problems while maintaining an elegant, modular and scale-able form. The primary role of Guardeon is to maintain independence in later years living while still providing primary caregivers a means to keep an eye out for their loved ones.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Guardeon tells the story of each day by logging events that are registered through our array of sensors, allowing knowledge of the activities of those within its area. A plethora of sensors communicates with our cloud hosted database to keep track, in real time, of the cared for. The primary caregiver is also able to customize the number and type of sensors around the house to collect the most effective and meaningful data. Our demo exposes three inputs that can be used to monitor activities. First, a button represents a pressure switch that pushes an event to the database whenever a door opens or closes. Second, a raindrop sensor is analogous to the shower or a faucet running. Finally, a temperature sensor can be used to track whether or not the oven or stove is on. Together these points in time represent a breadcrumb trail of the residents\u2019 activities while still preserving their privacy. After this data is collected insights can be made, anomalies can be detected, and most importantly safety can be ensured.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>A ESP8266 WiFi module, running a flashed Arduino script, was used to communicate between the sensors and the database. Our sensors, as mentioned above, consisted for the time being of a pressure sensor, raindrop sensor and temperature sensor. On the software side of things, Jelastic\u2019s cloud service was utilized to implement the database. The web app was implemented using HTML, CSS, and the Javascript framework VueJS. And finally, our API interface, allowing access to the database from the web app and the hardware, was implemented using the Flask framework for the Python language.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some difficulties included creating the web API in Python because it required learning the Flask framework to create our RESTful API. The limited knowledge of this realm hindered our speed and accuracy in developing this portion of the project. Additionally, creating the Jelastic database was difficult due our lack of knowledge about the service. On the breadboard side of the equation, our WiFi module responsible for both running code and communicating with the database was finicky at best. Beyond that we also had to battle spikes in current that reset the system and disrupted sensory data transmission. Overall, we were able to overcome these challenges in one way or another. In the future a more cautious approach to both the backend software system and the hardware implementation would be beneficial.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We built a really cool full stack IoT system! From circuit design to UI of a web interface we each brought our special talents to the table a developed something extraordinary. It was gratifying to see each component come together. To have the Arduino send a \u2018POST\u2019 request then to see the connection to the database and the subsequent actions involved in processing the request, was a great experience. Likewise designing a sleek UI that was able to utilize our backend to deliver a quality service was incredible. Join these together and Gaurdeon becomes a force to be reckoned with. Of course there is much more development before it is ready for release, but for only having a weekend, we did pretty well!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>So much. For each of us the knowledge gained was more concentrated in certain areas more than others, but it was because of this concentration that we were able to create Gaurdeon. Electrical engineering came into play designing circuits, Flask was a new framework to the members that worked on the back end system, and end-to-end implementation was a new experience for nearly all of us.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Guardeon</h2>\n<p>Guardeon\u2019s use cases are not limited to only what we developed here, its set up can be configured through the user-friendly web app to tackle many different scenarios and thus serve a different purpose based on how the client sees its benefits. Additionally, the ever growing sector of machine learning has a very close tie to our system based on the quantity of data as well as the meaning behind it. We already have many ideas how we can implement these techniques to unlock a treasure trove of insights provide by the event data that Gaurdeon collects.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jelastic\">jelastic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Back-end developer, API creation.", "Front-end web application development and design", "hardware development, embedded software", "Hardware developer, electronics", "Back-end developer, API creation."]], ["FutureBusStation", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwXRNItnI3w?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FutureBusStation \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/257/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Interactive menu</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FutureBusStation \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/258/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Showing incoming busses with interaction</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FutureBusStation \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/259/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Showing targeted advertisement</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Ads in bus shelters are mostly static and the same for everyone.

All of this results in more than 1,5 billion pounds of waste yearly in America. More than 90% of receipts are instantly thrown away. For the individual, paper receipts are a pain in the ass. Your wallet is full of faded receipts in case you need to return or complain about your purchase. You maybe have to sort them on Sunday from all the transactions you made with your company card in the bar and then physically transport them to the accounting department. And what if you've lost your receipt!? No can do. We are living in the 21st century. We should have a better solution for our receipts. Oh yes, and 90% of people would want a digital receipt. Something to think about!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application uses NFC technology simultaneously with mobile payment to transfer the receipt instantly to your phone, thus totally eliminating the need of paper receipts. You can also easily filter and search for your receipts by date, company and card.

Management companies usually are not so good as they should be and nowadays many people change their management company to the way when they manage the house on their own. Let's call that way \"homeowner partnership\". In case of partnership, homeowners should elect a head of the partnership and committee from the homeowners, than committee hire employees such as accounting, labours etc, who do the actual work. All further decisions are made only by voting of all homeowners and only in case of 51% \"yes\".</p>\n<h3>The Problem</h3>\n<p>Russian Federation Rules related to homeowner partnerships says that the partnership cannot collect any amount of money to hold on a bank account. The partnership can charge the homeowners only in the end of a month after the fact they used some kind of services only.</p>\n<p>It leads us to a big problem when something bad happened. Let's say, we have roof leaks. In this case we must collect the money to fix the problem and we can only do so through the meeting and collective decision making by voting. So, we must announce a meeting of homeowners. The announcement have to be at least two weeks before the meeting. There should be at least 51% of homeowners at the meeting and they should vote accordingly. If they decide that it's okay to collect the money, the homeowners will get the receipt at the end of the current month. Than, some day in the future they will pay. </p>\n<p>It means 3 months have passed and we still have not collected the money to fix the roof! And this is true for anything, for each even really small issue. :( </p>\n<p>In my case my house partnership uses a telegram chat as a default communication cannel, so every homeowner represented and can vote. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The bot allows the head of partnership to create a survey. In the survey, in case if a homeowner answer yes, bot provides a mandatory form thru which the homeowner instantly transfer money to fix the problem to the partnership's bank account. When a homeowner votes yes, we hold the money on their bank account, and if at the end of the survey we have more then 51% \"yes\" we actually charge them.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Telegram + Bot API + C# </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Most of the time we tried to find a real problem, spec it out, find existing solutions, and if there is nothing, start implementing it. So, we started a few hours ago :)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We found a lot of small and big issues and existed tools to solve them. We are proud of the depth of the discussion and consideration of the problems of even smallest but critical psychological aspects of using the product.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to work in a team.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PayBot</h2>\n<p>We are going to use it for our homeowner partnership. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/telegram\">telegram</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/yandex-money\">yandex-money</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I'm a product designer.

However, this is hard to notice without measurement.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app - aum - brings HRV measurement to meditation. During each meditation session HRV is measured using any Bluetooth heart rate monitor, such as Polar H7 or Suunto Smart. After the session HRV measurements are displayed and compared with measurements from the previous sessions. This way user can get an objective feedback loop of the effects of his meditation.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We integrated Bluetooth heart rate monitor using Swift and provided an interface for React Native.

</div>\n<div>\n<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n<p>===================================================================</p>\n<p>Let us think about pastime we are fond of. Travelling, fleeping news feed, watching movies, any more ideas?\nBut what is not only pleasant but vital? The answer is food. We cook it ourselves, buy semi-finished products and visit restaurants. of course. Restaurants existed many many many years ago and are not going to dissapear.\nThat's why our idea is connected with this service.</p>\n<h1>What it does</h1>\n<p>===================================================================</p>\n<p>Imagine. You have just appeared at the restaurant door but the staff already knows, what kind of dish would please you most of all, while you have no idea what to order. What if  you also get discount for your food preferences?\nWe developed a system, combining features of: mobile apps for booking and searching restaurants; CRMs.\nDealWithMeal provides the further options:\nAutomated process of a restaurant visiting (Searching by criteria(), booking a table)\nIntelligent recommendatory system, which helps to choose the most desired dishes.\nDiscount system  (for example, for favourite visitor's dishes)</p>\n<h1>How I built it</h1>\n<p>===================================================================</p>\n<p>It was very complex process. We had a lot of work to do so it was very important to organize ourselves perfectly. We all know each other pretty well, so we had a good interaction and it helped us to get everything done in time. Finally, what was actually done? Firstly, we have spent a lot of time brainsorming and developing the main algorithm and architecture of our program. Secondly, we pointed the aims, that must be reached. It was enormous work to make the main architecture, think over questions about details in realization of some features. While we were implementing the project, we faced a lot of problems and bugs, some of which were so stupid, that we have laughed when they were fixed.\nOur system has the further main components: backend (Django Rest Framework), frontend (JQuery), iOS app, recommendatory algorithm (machine learning).\nOur algorithm is intended to advise dishes to client in 3 different situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is client`s first visit to any restaurant (connected to our system);</li>\n<li>Client has already ordered something in any restaurant (connected to our system);</li>\n<li>Client has already ordered something in current order.\nThere is no matter if client is ordering a table at website, by app or just at restaurant \u0432\u0402\u201c we will advise him something he would be glad to eat!\nOur server is built using REST-architecture, so it has quite similar cases of interaction with app and frontend.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Challenges I ran into</h1>\n<p>===================================================================</p>\n<p>The very first challenge was to generate idea. It is very difficult to come up with something new, but finally we've done it. And now we believe in DealWithMeal.\nThe other challenge was to concentrate on work. Junction 2016 has manifold program: amazing events, interesting partners and guests, new people. But call of duty made us sit and code.\nWe also managed to keep good communication channel between the members of our team. It is difficult to reach understanding, when everyone has a unique task.</p>\n<h1>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h1>\n<p>===================================================================</p>\n<p>Our team is proud of our project. It seemed  impossible to perform such a result for 36 hours, but we dealed with it.\nWe also dealed with developing entire, intelligent system, which can be really useful both for restaurants and visitors.\nWe are also proud of each other. Every member of the team is vital, every member is inseparable part of  Team \"BORSCH\".</p>\n<h1>What I learnt</h1>\n<p>===================================================================</p>\n<p>First of all, we have learned how to deal with the problems if the time is short. Secondly, we have learned how to separate the duties effectively. We also have drilled the co-working skills and met many interesting people.</p>\n<h1>What's next for DealWithMeal</h1>\n<p>===================================================================</p>\n<p>Our aim is to implement our project in real life. We are sure that it is very useful.\nWe would like to extend our reccomendatory system and work not only with dishes, but with restraunts' logistics, purchasing; to improve the algorithm, to make it faster and more intelligent.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">django-rest-framework</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://188.166.65.99:8080/login/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://188.166.65.99:8080/login/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>188.166.65.99</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/maks-sh/Junction2016-Borsch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/maks-sh/Junction2016-Borsch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I am front-end developer of desktop site.", "I worked on recommendatory system", "I worked on the recommendation algorithm and architecture development", "I worked on the backend", ""]], ["UPMHack business case", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UPMHack business case \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/992/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Potential</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UPMHack business case \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/007/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Net value</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UPMHack business case \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/017/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Conclusions</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We have noticed during other hackathons the teams has not taken business value conciderations into account the way they should.

Besides that, children are often scared and nervous in the anesthesiology and operation processes.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We split our idea in 2 parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An application that will automatically send updated information to family depending of how the surgery is going, reducing the time that doctors and nurses are giving to families during the surgery.</li>\n<li>A robot that helps the kid to reduce fear and calm him down. It will be a friend which mirror kid's emotions, giving a protection sense and comprehension.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The robot chassis would be made with 3D printers, of a biocompatible and non magnetic material. It would also include microcontrollers and DC motors. For the physical interaction with patients and familiars, some cameras are included to recognize faces and emotions to give personalized answers. To give realism to the robot-face, light projection technology will be used (from the inside the head). Finally the robot would include a motion system based on marks recognition along the hospital.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We mainly highlight the problem of the age of the children. Our robot can be used for a wide range of ages, from 0 to 8 years old, but not excluding the other ages, where games might be redesign according their age.</p>\n<p>Besides that, understanding children was another interesting challenge we dealt with.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The eBuddy is a different and new alternative to be used as a personal friend for kids, to give them enough power and confidence to overcome surgery. Besides that, both robot and app will help doctors to focus on their job, reducing caregivers time (avoiding giving updates during the surgery) and providing a more comfortable and calm kid.</p>\n<h2>What we learnt</h2>\n<p>One of the most important things we learnt is to deal with different points of view the same problem can cause. Contact with real employers allowed us to understand better what are the <strong>real</strong> problems the health sector has and how we need to go through solutions.</p>\n<h2>What's next for eBuddy by SalmaTech</h2>\n<p>We have a lot of more ideas that our robot may implement in the future. For example, we are thinking about widen the age range of kids to 12 years, creating an interactive \"friend\" to whom the boy can talk in order to distract him. We think the range 8-12 years old boys do not want to feel like 'little children', and a real-time, artificial intelligent friend may help.</p>\n<p>A smooth, fluffy and washable cover that can be used to give a feeling of sympathy, delight and affection in children.</p>\n<p>A better design of the body and structure can de done.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">uml</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">face-recognition</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">emotions</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">robotics</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">app</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">database</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">artificial-intelligence</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-office\">microsoft-office</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2fekZZ9Qg1BTjRfOGRtYUl3Qms?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2fekZZ9Qg1BTjRfOGRtYUl3Qms?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Energion", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Energion \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/468/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Recommended time route usage</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Energion \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/464/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The best prices in the timeFrame</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Energion \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/492/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>All the prices for current/next day colored with the best/worst time to use the energy</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We've got our inspiration searching for solutions involving the potential ways to save the energy.

Based on the prices, we can control how the interested people would use their electrical appliances based on the provided information.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>First of all, it was a tough sleepless night.

Another team member is proud of the cake she (or he?) cooked during the event. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot of things, not just about the energy. A little bit about design, more about the mobile application design and the data flows within the complex system.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Energion</h2>\n<p>The next thing would be improving the mobile app functionality (UI improvements, extended notifcation info, price history and user accounts, <strong>ACHIEVEMENTS</strong> within neighbours/friends!) and uploading it to the appStore to make the higher number of people aware of the energy issue.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mpandroidchart</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">retrofit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Energion/EnergionAndroid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Energion/EnergionAndroid\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["OutfitMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMtHF2UV0Xc?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"OutfitMe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/333/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Maria uses OutfitMe</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our dear friend Maria, who is totally into fashion, was complaining how difficult and time-consuming it's to find clothes she liked while browsing fashion magazines and Instagram of her favorite superstars.

We also didn't forget about shop's needs. Salesforce platform is a CRM system that provides with detailed analytics about sales and customers. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were two major challenges for us. First, to define the right training model for our AI. And second, to find good images in enough number (we needed at least 1000 images for each brand\\ age group\\ cloth item\\ color and so on) dataset to train the algorithm. <br/>\nAs dataset we used is quite small, our app might not work perfectly, and we plan to continue training our ML algorithm using more pictures.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It's amazing how, by choosing the right technologies, we were able to built an AI solution only in two days, that just recently was required months of development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Strikely</h2>\n<p>We plan to work on neat UI, so Maria could completely enjoy her experience with OutfitMe App. Also, we need spend couple more days to train our AI algorithm on a bigger dataset.

There are always occasions where you don\u2019t know what to wear or how to\ncomplete your look. We\u2019ve worked on solving these common problems among men between the ages\nof 21 and 38. </p>\n<p>We\u2019ve found ways to accommodate your style trough the Zleek app. We inspire,\neducate and accommodate you through styles and choices that will fit the type of person you are. For\nZalando, that means more sales, and for the consumer it means an effortless shopping experience.\nThe secret to impeccable style is knowing how to coordinate the colour of your clothes and dress for\nyour body type. Our app is the middleman between you, the customer, and the online shop. The app\nacts as the most helpful shopping advisor as it demonstrates options that fit your signature style,\nbased on the picture you take and your own input.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve found ways to accommodate your style trough the Zleek app. The app acts as the styling advisor\nspecifically to help match clothing items to curate a look by taking the persons style in mind and find clothing for your body shape.</p>\n<p>How it works </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>You will have to pick a style out of four general styles that you feel related to. Take a picture of your outfit and highlight a specific item you want to either replace or want to match it with other items to buy a look. .</p></li>\n<li><p>Based on colors and shape of the clothes you are wearing, we can present the ideal items that will suit your current\nwardrobe as well as interest you in something stylish you didn\u2019t even know you would love.</p></li>\n<li><p>With the easy touch of a button, you will be able to proceed to check out and safely transact your order.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We focused on the difficulties in the project and started solving them at first. For example for extracting data from an image in terms of garment, color and pattern. We didn't succeed in implementing a very useful clothing parsing library, we found <a href=\"http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/%7Eesimo/publications/SimoSerraACCV2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this research paper that has an implementation of the solution.</a> With some more time and an Unix based development environment we are sure this is implementable in a short notice. </p>\n<p>Suggesting garments to a user was the most difficult part for us. It was important for us to know the fundamentals of fashion consulting and put those rules into code. During our research in this field we came across various set of rules that we can use. We focused on color combination styling and wrote the set of rules that lead to a more stylish look within your own style category. Other possibilities that we didn't implement in the designs but have designed in terms of code is clothes suggestion based on your body build. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We identified 2 main challenges. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classifying garments through an image and finding colors and patterns</li>\n<li>Making suggestions based on what the person is wearing. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We proudly converted the basic fundamentals of how a fashion consultant gives advice. By mainly focusing on color matching. From there we are able to build further with body shape. </p>\n<p>Even though we didn't have something working that extracts data from an image, (data like colors and patterns in clothes). We got closer than people expected we could come. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Leo: java, playframework, matlab, opencv\nManish: Fashion consulting, matlab</p>\n<h2>What's next for Zleek</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Narrow down clothing options for customers while having better clothing suggestions. We can give more accurate suggestions if we have time to do proper research on fashion consulting.</li>\n<li>make better suggestions by analyzing previous preferences and purchases</li>\n<li>ability for user to share the suggestions made by Zleek and run a poll to get to a perfect find.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kagan94/Zleek\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kagan94/Zleek\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["SafeBank", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Although there is a ton of various applications on the market, only a few apps are installed on every single device and they are messengers.

We wanted to explore the future of shopping. Where we can reduce shipping costs , warehouse costs , we could probably replace a lot of salesperson with robots. Having only a few employees at offline stores would work because everything else will be automated. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Zalando Pop Stores are the Popup shops that dont really sell stuff but acts more like a public display where people can try on the things they like.There are just a few pieces of clothes in every size available and they aren't for sale. They are available just for trials. </p>\n<p>Example : \nZaalando's Retail store 1 : There are 3 devices in the scenario : A tablet at the entrance will entertain a customer by helping them choose what they want and what is available in the store saving a lot of time and helping them customize the look. \nDevice 2 ( for Consumer ) Another device is in the trial rooms which will help a user directly purchase a cloth in the trial room by scanning the bar code on it . The product will be added to the user's cart. If the user has any issue with the fitting or so they can ask for another size from the staff in seconds via the app only saving a lot of time thus increasing product trials. Notification will be sent to the salesperson and they can respond immediately. </p>\n<p>Device 3 ( for SalesPerson) - There is one device with admin Dashboard for the Salesperson with data specific to that store. Your staff can monitor and understand your sales with the help of data visualization that we provide about your products.Everything from scanning items, trying products, discarding and keeping merchandise, and more.Customer shopping habits, likes and dislikes, product performance, and fit issues which will then help in managing better.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used several sets of technology mentioned in the project details. We went through several iterations and broke down the problem into smaller pieces to understand it completely so as to provide a completely unique solution which was cost effective. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the major problems was understanding the European market where Zalando prevails. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We really think that this can solve a lot of time and money for small business. Also , through this product Zaalando can reach out to both Businesses and Consumers. B2B and B2C will work quite well as Zalando is already targeting small businesses. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt about a different set of problems which is not at all considered in regions like Asia. We learnt about thinking  and psychology of customers of an unknown market. We tried to solve the problem by creating a B2B and a B2C product at the same time. This is a unique problem which can solve a lot of problems in the Ecomm market globally. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Pop Stores by Zalando</h2>\n<p>Smart Mirrors, AR/VR for trying out outfits in trial rooms without changing clothes.

With ParkMyCar, the most enhanced technologies (IoT, satellite imaging, and accurate localization, etc.) can be integrated. Based on our solution, a promising global business model can be established.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>In the mobile app, the user can choose an area of interest, and see how many parking slots are there. Instead of driving around to find a parking slot, our mobile app directly shows the various options one has: public parking space, charged parking houses, etc. The app does not show only free parking slots, but it also informs about prices and maximum allowed parking duration. \nCar drivers will also be possible to book a parking space in charged parking houses. This opportunity enables the parking house owner to set the prices dynamically; like airline companies sell tickets for different prices.</p>\n<h2>How we monetize our work</h2>\n<p>We have different options to do so. The app will show some advertisements which can be removed for premium users. In the future, there will be even more monetize options. 1) We could charge a brokerage for parking payments in charged parking houses. 2) Car manufacturers could include our parking system in their self-driving cars. 3) Information about the user's interests (Facebook, etc.) will enable showing fitted advertisement in places where the user is going to park. 4) Cooperations with other transportation services such as Uber, Taxi, etc.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The information about free parking slots is collected from our IoT-based prototype that includes several sources such as sensors and video cameras. Additional information from statistical records and external APIs (Embers, ESA, etc.) has being set up.

Or the frustration as a maintenance professional when you just get an email that a coffee machine in this huge building is broken, and you have to send 3 emails to figure out where it actually is.  ATS, Automated Ticketing System to the rescue. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ATS automatically collects data from sensors and devices and when it detects something is broken or needs attention, it automatically creates a ticket and assigns it to the maintenance person closest to the problem with the expertise to handle the problem according to rules made by your company. Maintenance professionals have their own mobile app where they see their current tasks, their locations and priorities.</p>\n<p>The maintenance professional have several options. Once they receive the tickets, they can accept and start working. They can raise an issue saying they have a problem fixing the issue or assigned task. Once, they are done, they can mark the issue resolved for now. </p>\n<p>It also provides a dashboard for managerial or monitoring purposes with the list of personnel and the list of tasks assigned for each personnel. We have a plan to add many more features to both the android application and the dashboard. For now, a prototype of its working is near to complete.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We have a PHP backend with MySQL database that keeps track of the tickets, persons and rules in the company. It also receives the data from the devices and locations of the personnel with the Tieto API and uses that data along with the rules crafted by your company to automatically assign the tickets. We also built an android application for maintenance personnel, where they can see their tasks to do, specific information, location and error codes from the machine that is broken. They can also report a problem regarding the broken machine using the app. The foreman can control the flow of tickets manually, if needed, using the web dashboard. We also constructed a simple Arduino-based sensor and simulated the data generation and posting it to the backend.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge was the lack of time. We came up with this idea during Junction, so we did all the planning during Junction, which decreased the amount of time available for coding, so we didn't have time to add all the features we wanted and improve the user experience and usability. We also had problems with getting our mockup sensor to work with our backend. The problems were mainly focused around Windows's serial port drivers. Nevertheless this won't have an effect on our programs functionality when the sensors have an API.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Effective utilization of infrastructure data. \nCrafting a full stack system during one day. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As this was our first hackathon, the time we had available was smaller than we had initially thought and we learned that if you want to create something, you really have to take into account the time you have. Maybe next time we will create something that can be reasonably done in 48 hours and is still innovating and useful. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Automatic Ticketing System</h2>\n<p>Adding more functionality and features: Usage of GPS data from employees' mobile phones, providing the client's of the maintenance company access to a map of the problems and status of the problems in their building. Improvement and refinement of the UI for the mobile application and the foreman's dashboard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tieto-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cakephp\">cakephp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/k4rriL/ATS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/k4rriL/ATS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I also contributed in the idea.

Like really really bad. It takes him at least an hour to get out of bed. It doesn't matter what time he sets his alarm clock, he is always late. We are trying to help him and people who struggle with similar problems. That's why we decided to create an app just for that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You set your alarm clock for the morning and go to bed. In the morning the App will go ring ring ring. Now you have a choice: you either stop the alarm or snooze it. But with snoozes come great responsibility. Every time you snooze you will be charged a small amount. The more you snooze the more money goes. We heard money is a good motivator. But don't worry. It won't go to waste. After you hit snooze you contribute to a local charity. But I bet you say \"Haha, jokes on you. I will close the alarm clock and fall back to sleep!\". This is where OURA rings comes to play. With it's super sensitive sensors the Chnooze will know when you fell asleep. Guess what happens then? Yep, charity! \nFurthermore, OURA ring data is used to analyse your activity patterns. You can see on a pretty graph how are your snoozes and daily readiness connected. Do you feel more tired with more snoozes? Do you need to make some changes? Do change, and instantly see how that reflects on your well-being.\nTo add a little bit more fun, Chnooze is also connected to your Muki mug. Get a cheerful message every morning you wake up without a snooze. If you do snooze, we will try to motivate you with some we-know-you-can-do-better images.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The main app is currently on Android. For that we used Android Studio and Java. The app uses built in alarm services to set and call the alarm. Data is displayed on a radar graph using MPAndroidChart. For data, the app makes request to our server. Before that, user has to authorise OURA API in the app.\nThe Server runs in Azure as Web App and is connected to SQL server on Azure. We use PHP and Laravel as Framework. The server is responsible for app specific user authentication and also allowing OURA API access. \nWe used Deveo to manage our project. All parts had their separate git (android, API, sales and wiki). We used build in issue trackers to get closer to our milestones. Also Toggl was integrated into Deveo for easier time management. \nServer was deployed through git push straight to Azure. All post deploy scripts were handled there. Deveo wiki has all the available endpoints to the server with descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Everyone had their hard parts. For API setting up the server was one of the hardest. Azure has it's own configuration that had to be met. Also had some problems with connecting to the OURA API. Downgrading GuzzleHttp (used for get and post requests) helped. \nAndroid app also had some problems with OURA connection when the user was not previously authenticated in OURA. And there are always some little things that take time and then you go 'Oh.. silly me'.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are all really happy to be part of something big. Being here is already an accomplishment. Being able to work as a team is what we aimed for. And we think we did it good. Maybe we didn't have time to implement all the things we wanted, but we had a chance to do something awesome with cool OURA rings and innovative coffee mugs. We can't do that every day.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Nothing goes as planned. Ever. \nSome team members learned a lot more about Android. Some about sales. Some learned that server side configuration should be left to system administrators.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Chnooze</h2>\n<p>We still need to tweak some features to make a best app to cure our friend's problems. The minimum we want is the app to be ready enough for him. But we aim for a full app and working with OURA and Muki to deliver an lifestyle app that is helpful and fun. Hope to see you all using it some day.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">oura</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muki</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/inkscape\">inkscape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">icomoon</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://chnooze.press/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://chnooze.press/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>chnooze.press</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.deveo.com/antdroids/projects/chnooze/wiki/Home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://app.deveo.com/antdroids/projects/chnooze/wiki/Home\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>app.deveo.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Lets Gamify", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>\"Together everyone achieves more\".</p>\n<p>Employees are the backbone of any successful workplace.

mobile_based application and telecommunication technologies to develop a smart repository prototype to help individual people, restaurants, shops, municipalities as well as companies in managing inventories efficiently and economic.</h3><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>What it does:</h3><h3>\nWe have developed new hardware, web-server and a mobile application to remotely control current status and trend of goods consumption in our kitchen, home, restaurants, companies inventories, etc. as well as effective management of recycle bins in buildings and cities. Our device detect every-time consumption and transfer data via raspberry-pi (which can be replaced by a hub later for industrial use) to the web-server. In addition, we have developed a website and an application which presents current status of our repositories, trends, and suggest the items that need to be supplied, a price list from different shops, shops nears to our current location.</h3><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>How I built it:</h3><h3>\nWe have used 3D printing to build our prototype repository model. The load-cell HX711 is used to detect the weight and send it to an AVR-micro controller to transfer via a Bluetooth module to the raspberry-pi. A shocker sensor has been used to start the micro controller every time we change the materials inside container and raspberry-pi turn off the micro controller to save the battery and have a long life system. The raspberry-pi is passing the data to a web-server. We have created a website (using C# and jsp) based on the received data to analyze and present the trend of consumption, available amount of materials and some sample recipes. An android-based application shows our current status of repository remotely, suggests the items that should be supplied and the price list from some shops. It also shows the markets near us on Google Map.</h3><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>Challenges I ran into:</h3><h3>\nWe are going for both IoT and Intelligent Building tracks (not a challenge).</h3><p></p>\n<p></p><h3> Accomplishments that I'm proud of:</h3><h3>\nIn a short time, we could develop a smart device and services on top of it with few Euros which could solve challenging problems of different entities in society, including our homes, industries and cities.</h3><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>What I learned:</h3><h3>\nWe learnt about couple of interesting new applications, software, IoT, Smart buildings, cooperative team spirit, tight schedule projects, etc.</h3><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>What's next for InvECO:</h3><h3>\nWe believe our idea and solution could be successful in real environment and we would like to take this idea to business context and develop a new start-up based on that.</h3><p></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">avr-microcontroller</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Build A Raft", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGJrUSxih_8?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build A Raft \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/655/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build A Raft \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/661/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build A Raft \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/954/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build A Raft \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/955/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Build A Raft \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/658/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Build A Raft</h2>\n<p>Once upon a time there was a game...\nWell this isn't like that!

Mobile first!</p>\n<p>The business values of the feature are: fast data collection of users' preferences, more items' displays (leads to higher conversion).</p>\n<p>When the app is started, several items (marketing team decides on which) are starting to fall to the center of the screen with a high speed, persist for a short period of time, vanish. The idea is to show pictures fast, to imitate the regular way customer \"scans\" clothing when passing through in a real-life shop, deciding whether the item is attractive or not. User can swipe right if liked the item, and left if disliked (Tinder-like approach). Also item can be left unprocessed. After the flash research is completed, user can either continue with the app or go to a separate page with results. Results page also allows user to  get forwarded to the item's main page or play again. Stats are collected for following analysis (in this prototype they are shown on a separate page).</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Simple prototype built with mentioned above technologies in a team of four developers with various backgrounds.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Writing front-end codes is quite challenging for back-enders, it is sometime not easy to get a table for a team, agreeing on the technical aspects of the implementation might get tricky, lack of time is always there, team members' cooperation takes time, gluing the developed codes together is challenging.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We are proud of</h2>\n<p>We actually have something to commit here today, quite an achievement for the first hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>Think and agree on the possible idea in advance might boost the process. More time for initial discussion is required, everyone should take part. Team needs a leader for both: technical and business (delivery) processes. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Zalander</h2>\n<p>Further marketing analysis of the data collected. Creation of the \"admin\" pages for easier item management. Gamification of the process by introducing competition elements. As an example, users swipes to guess the most popular items in specific category, again, the statistics are collected as well as the amount of display times raise. </p>\n<p>If the usage of swipe gesture in a described manner will prove to be successful, then it could potentially be also introduced to main shopping-apps as a replacement for \"clumsy\" way of adding items to

Hele bemoaned the lack of good apps for tracking your sports trainings without hassle. We thought this was something we could change, and so we decided to apply to Junction to get the idea off the ground.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Betrain has four main features. (1) Keeping a training diary with integrations with popular existing tools such as Polar flow services, SportsTracker and HeiaHeia and making analyses of done workouts to follow the development. (2) Conversational interface which allows you to easily fill the diary without having to write stuff done on a mobile screen. (3) Deep learning AI to recognize problem areas and provide real-time feedback and advices. (4) Same AI used to fill out monthly training templates based on performance goals.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The speech interface is built on top of two components: Microsoft's Bing Speech API providing speech-to-text and text-to-speech, and Chatscript for dialogue management. Interfacing between the APIs and applications turned out to be rather difficult, with Chatscript even having its own application protocol. Debugging took much of our time as usual. In addition, we produced mockups of our app's screens and implemented 75% of these in React Native.</p>\n<p>We planned to get data from the Polar API and to train a deep learner to predict an athlete's near-term development in performance using Tensorflow. We never quite got around to implementing this feature, but it's definitely on the table as we continue perfecting the app in the future.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Time was our enemy number one. Even though many of us barely slept, our initial app idea was too ambitious to even produce proofs of concept of most of our planned features.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We got a good start on our project. Even though a lot had to be scrapped, we got things done. This provides a good basis for continuing our app in the future.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to configure and use React Native and Microsoft Azure Services. We also sharpened our javascript skills by figuring out websockets.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Betrain</h2>\n<p>We'll continue to make this into an app, hoping to make it available sometime in Q2 2017.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chatscript</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/notepad\">notepad++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Junction-2016-Aalto-Helsinki-Fitness/PTSI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Junction-2016-Aalto-Helsinki-Fitness/PTSI\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the frontend, coding one of the app pages for Android.

This time we were simply out of ideas for the proposed tracks. We decided to do game jam as we've never done one. Our main idea was to come up with a simple but somewhat new gameplay idea. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>After the sixtyfourth world war, it has finally come to the end.

We were abitious and chose the technology that wasn't the strongest one for our team. Eventually it lead into Juha doing all the hard work for implementation, and rest of us weren't able to help out at all. So it was built on pure perseverance.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We have never built a game with Unity, or practically any game before with level management / storyline. 1/3 of our team was able to do anything with Unity right away, so it offloaded too much work for single person. So we tried to come up with an original idea and make somewhat different gameplay, but didn't have time at all to actually wrap the GAME around it. At its current state our project remains as a proof-of-concept for an idea of a gameplay and not a fully featured game as we intended. Our algorithm to check the level clearance was actually too slow.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Actually implemented something that was planned.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Unity is nice when you know it, and bitch when you don't. We learned that we should've made a cookie-clicker instead of aiming higher. It's good to be ambitious, but sometimes it's more satisfying to actually deliver something 100% working than delivering a half-baked product. Next time.. there's always one, we hope that we have better ideas that are easier to implement.</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Wall</h2>\n<p>Maybe, someday, make it to be what we intended it to be eventually, someday, maybe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CoderCoded/TheWall\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CoderCoded/TheWall\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Don't Stop!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o8ZNsEgyCZQ?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Don't Stop! \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/913/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>initial screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Don't Stop! \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/914/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>info screen_1</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Don't Stop! \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/915/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>info screen_2</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Don't Stop! \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/916/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>info screen_3</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The main idea is to make bus waiting time, which can be sometimes longer than 10 minutes, more useful and meaningful. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>John Snow is a tourist who is visiting Helsinki and <strong>he knows nothing</strong> about the city. He arrives at the bus stop and looks at LCD touch screen, where real time information about available buses and their arrival times are displayed. He selects one of the available buses and application displays animated route. During the animation app starts providing interesting, fascinating and worthy to know facts related to the surroundings, such as: Correlated to history places, Parliaments, Stadiums, Companies etc, those could have valuable information. This means that the application can be thought as a little guide for the surrounding places.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Application has two parts. Front end, which is mobile application(android, fully native written on Java) and the back-end which is built on ruby on rails. Also we used local HSL api to get information about buses, their estimated arrival time and related bus stations. So, the app retrieves information from our API, while the API - from HSL api. We used the heroku to publish our API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Few of the challenges were coordinate positioning for the smooth Animation, HSL API integration, creating responsive design and 3 days of no sleep. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are happy that we solved the problem and the app is intended not only to entertain the users but teach or remind them significant facts about the surrounding places.

It creates an innovative playground of different data sets and connections between them, suggesting you new data sets you can use and where you can find it.</p>\n<p>It aggregates observations in different open data stores' datasets into simple metadata objects and allows to search in them.</p>\n<p>Our proposal is each dataset from all the databases are aggregated to model which consists :</p>\n<p>Origin\nTitle\nVariables\nKeywords\nLanguage</p>\n<p>When user inputs a search query, we make a search on Title, Variables and Keywords and present the results retrieved.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We have built a mockup service with ruby on rails, deployed it on azure.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had challenges to understand what different APIs deliver to user and how to get it all to common ground. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We came with a plan to unite various public APIs which provide statistical data.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We have learned about data available from public datasets and what kind of information they deliver in Finland.</p>\n<h2>What's next for EasyData</h2>\n<p>This tool can be used not only for health and welfare data but also in other fields of science.\nAlso, next step is connecting EasyData for various different data sources that will give the wide choices, relevant and precise information and easy understanding of innovative data combinations for users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Learning API's of target sources, lending page of our site.", "", "", "", ""]], ["Factory floor goes Mobile", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjFFpnZMtu0?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Factory floor goes Mobile \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/449/999/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Screen shot of mobile app</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The use case immediately sparked ideas in our process minded heads in how we could improve the process of obtaining information about the reels and production, and <strong>reduce the time</strong> used and possible <strong>errors made</strong> in this process. After discussing the use cases more with UPM we also discovered that our solution could be <strong>useful for also other areas of the supply chain</strong>, e.g. technical sales, logistics and even customers. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>At the moment UPM factory floor supervisors have to manually analyse the paper reels taken aside in production. This involves getting a bar code from the reel, walking to the office, inputting data to the production system and making decisions on what to do with the reels taken aside.</p>\n<p>By introducing QR codes to paper reels and shipping manifests, and providing the UPM factory floor supervisors with an web based application to read these codes, we make it possible:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For the UPM factory floor supervisors to analyze reels in situation, without the need to walk to the control room and manually enter information. </li>\n<li>Supervisor to get a simple view \u2013 only the decision making critical information is shown. No overloading with information. </li>\n<li>Give supervisor the ability to decide if they want to change e.g. prime, reason code or nexthand directly in the mobile app for the right reel while standing right next to the reel. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>The application <strong>removes</strong> possibility for <strong>human error</strong> as no information is inputted manually - which in turn reduces the issues down the line in packaging and all the way in customer satisfaction. This will have positive financial impact. \n<strong>Future proof solution.</strong> QR codes can include all sorts of data that can add value to the supply chain. Once the QR codes are part of infrastructure, additional solutions that make use of the QR code can add value for sales, logistics and customer.\nIt <strong>reduces the time</strong> supervisors need to spend on the process of going through the paper reels which allows them to focus on more useful work. \nThe QR code directs the user into UPM\u2019s system. In order to access the information, the system will require an authentication. When someone is not logged in and he can't access QR code data as he lacks authentication into the system. So this new system won\u2019t change the current security that UPM already has. <strong>QR codes are as secure as UPM\u2019s own systems.</strong></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wanted to know 1st the business needs before we went into more detail on the technical implementation. As we've seen before, understanding the business issues and needs are always the key to solving any process issues. After understanding the need we built a NodeJS based web application to demonstrate the feasibility of providing a simple application to workers on the factory floor. In addition we mocked up what a fully developed version could look like.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into:</h2>\n<p>Project initially wouldn't deploy to Bluemix. Started with only about 7 days of development experience with any of the platforms/frameworks used.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of:</h2>\n<p>Pretty much all code, since this is our first real NodeJS project.\nWe're also proud of the solution we thought of as it is easy to deploy, has a great business case, and has potential to improve work for many different departments at UPM. </p>\n<h2>What we learned:</h2>\n<p>On the coding side NodeJS, Express, Pug/Jade, Bluemix, DashDB, bootstrap. On business side we learned how paper mills function, what issues they can have, and what issues paper business has in general. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Factory floor goes Mobile:</h2>\n<p>Greatness! Integration to factory systems would be a logical step - and finding more use cases with small changes to the basic concept. </p>\n<p>For trying out the solution you need valid UICs or Unit Codes. You can use any one from the database, but here are a few examples just in case:\nUIC: 25007808440290, 23002327040290, 26002583630284\nUnit code: 902500780849, 902500780853,902500768160</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cloud-foundry\">cloud-foundry</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dashdb</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">atomic.io</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://upm-reel-identifier.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://upm-reel-identifier.eu-gb.mybluemix.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>upm-reel-identifier.eu-gb.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Demo (MOnitoring Employee's Desk)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bjJIFmo_UUU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>There are many applications working in the smart building based on the occupancy, presence, and flow of the population in smart buildings.

The team\u2019s diversity that could have been a challenge, turned into the real advantage.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt the basics of conducting an emergency drill and discover the need there is for occupants and building operators to better communicate on those matters in order to provide as much information and clear status to the fire brigade. Especially with changing working habits (working remotely\u2026), it is difficult to appoint a permanent role to the occupants. Safety should be the primary concern of office workers, even if risks are remote.</p>\n<h2>What's next for \u201cEvacuate!\u201d</h2>\n<p>The prospect for our project is quite wide and full of opportunities: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Define best practices and KPIs for emergency evacuation drill exercises. We started by developing some metrics but the analytics of the results in the long run should provide a quantity of information necessary to create the best evacuation plan.</li>\n<li>Increase the potential of usage of any available data source for incidents location (fire and others), record last locations of occupants to detect if they are in danger (in case of eventual system failure as a result of fire or other emergency situations) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an elaboration on this, the co-operation with both authorities (fire brigade, rescue workers etc.) and building stakeholders would have huge implications from the Big Data perspective. The data collected in cases of emergency would be stored from each location up until a possible moment when the actual incident takes out the sensors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This would give authorities and building stakeholders better information on how the smoke travels in the building and how and why some systems might fail in case of emergency</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The case of emergency situations would also extend beyond the Finnish spectrum, and include states of emergency for e.g. natural disasters and terrorism.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nginx\">nginx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-rds-relational-database-service\">amazon-rds-relational-database-service</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["SkypeNet", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SkypeNet \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/030/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Activity Flow</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Language learning ressources are seeing an uprecedented rise but most focus on teaching grammar or vocabulary. Our paradoxical intention is to use a bot to bring out the human aspect of language teaching. With our skype bot you can call, have a conversation and be corrected. An opportunity that not everyone has. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You call the bot through skype. You start conversating with it. It keeps the conversation going. It expects answers within a topic and points out if there is a misunderstanding. Just like human interaction the person then has to repeat themself even clearer this time. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Microsoft Bot Framework and connected it with Skype. Using Bing Speech Recognition we get the audio interpreted as text. Then we pass it to the bot brain that is able to predict conversation topics and keep the conversation going. What we aim at is for the bot to learn through the Emotion API (Microsoft Cognitive Services). The criteria for passing is that the user is happy and the conversation is flowing freely. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>This is the first time for all of us to use the Microsoft Bot Framework. It is the first hackathon for one of the members and we learned to work together in a diverse group. Beyond our imagination we got a demo-able product up and running. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SkypeNet</h2>\n<p>The work that we need to complete with the bot is obvious but within reach. \nWe hope that we get to promote our service as a serious language teaching tool and that Skype will be able to introduce our product to its users. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/asp-net\">asp.net</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/skype\">skype</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/panichmaxim/SkypeNet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/panichmaxim/SkypeNet\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/educriado/junction-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/educriado/junction-2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked along Aliona to make the bot intelligent by memorizing the conversation and generating new topics and responses, starting with a basic model.

Our mixed background in lighting and power application and interior modelling gave us a wide spectrum of ideas to improve the experience inside a building in spite of who you are. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, the working model would gather feedback from occupants about the overall satisfaction and perceived satisfaction of lighting, temperature and feeling of draft. The building would then adjust those features related to the space the feedback is given in, while also optimizing building energy consumption.</p></li>\n<li><p>Second, the application would have reporting tool for easy and rewarding reporting of issues related to, for example, the maintenance. The user would simply write down the issue, estimate its urgency, take a picture of the issue and simply submit. The application would by default mark the location of the issue unless the user specifies a different location than where he submits the issue. Later on, the maintenance, cleaning personnel, etc. would navigate with the application to the issue.</p></li>\n<li><p>Third, the occupants would gather <strong>Good employee</strong> pointswhile they gave their feedback, reported issues or came by public transport/bike/walking. Also other sensor data, such as used amount of paper would be weighted. Basically, if the person didn't come by a private car, he would earn a point. In the end of each month, the most environmentally conscienous and most active person would get the Good employee award. <strong>In simple terms, this is a gamification feature</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>Fourth, the application provides a simple few click reservation of a meeting room from our dynamic room management system. At the initial time when the reservation is done, the user would estimate the number of persons attending. During the final hour, the application would ask from the host (or each participant of the meeting if specified). From this refreshed data, the app would assign a room best suited for the new participant amount. Also, if knowing the participants and their location, an optimal location could be identified in terms of, for example, distance or estimated energy consumption. The room temperature and lighting level would also be dynamic and react to for example on the monitored/expected number of people in the room.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the application would improve energy efficiency and also increase the satisfaction of all users of the building.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>First, were thinking to just sharpening a concept of our app and present a mock-up. But with the increased team size and coding skills we thought of going further. We ended up an having a mock-up and a very limited online test bench with UI built as WebGL (developed in Unity). The build has a lot of buried knowledge (scripts) not yet utilized in the UI.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Mostly project management related issues. What to do, when, and how. Though we had discussed before, the team composition and focus went through drastic changes just before the hackathon and also every day of the hack.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>All the things we learned by not giving up.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Some of us learned to code in a new language and in a new environment. Mostly, we learned about the ins and outs the life at hackathons. Everything is possible. </p>\n<h2>What's next for BuildingEnchancer</h2>\n<p>We will keep improving the logic and UI/UX.

In the end it will hopefully end in a confident and happy customer buying new clothes from Zalando. </p>\n<h2>How I built it (We)</h2>\n<p>We used the Microsoft Bot Framework and combined it with the zalando API.

Sleep is very important part of our lives, and we wanted to integrate health data into your daily tools.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Theresa fetches data from end user's \u014cURA account and can answer several questions about the sleep data in natural language. Theresa has access to your history data so you can track back your sleep. It is possible to ask about sleep duration, quality and heart rates for example. Theresa asks user's feeling at the morning. Theresa can tell what was the main problem in user's sleep based on user input and sleep data from \u014cURA.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Theresa bot is developed on Microsoft Bot Framework. It has a nodejs backend hosted in Heroku container. Natural language processing to transform chat messages to entities and intents is done using IBM Watson. Theresa is connected to the \u014cURA REST-API in order to analyze sleep data of the end user. With the help of Bot Framework, Theresa can be used via Skype, Telegram, Slack and all other major messaging platforms.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Main problems was with integrating the \u014cURA's OAUTH2 authentication to the chat bot. We resolved the basic problem of redirecting back to the chat, by using custom HTML-site working together with the bot but decided not to develop the authentication flow in order to focus creating better interaction about the end user's sleep data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to develop very useful bot in short period of time with the help of Watson APIs. We managed the train the bot to understand different ways to ask the questions quite well. We managed to create possibility to collect qualitative data and add features through simple and intuitive UI.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Microsoft Bot Framework and especially how to use IBM Watson APIs. We also learned interesting facts about sleeping and how to improve it in daily basis.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Theresa</h2>\n<p>It would be easy to train Theresa more intents. We have ideas how to collect more qualitative data about the sleep of user and use it to improve \u014cURA algorithms. Currently Theresa answers basically just facts about the raw data, but it would be great to ask Theresa about how to improve sleep and health. For example, it would be nice to ask Theresa \"How can I make my sleep better?\" or \"What was my problem last week?\"</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">botframework</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/slack\">slack</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/skype\">skype</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/telegram\">telegram</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">oura</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mikkokut/junction-2016-theresa\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mikkokut/junction-2016-theresa\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://telegram.me/theresabot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://telegram.me/theresabot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>telegram.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I prefer tea.\n", "I drank the coffee brought by Emil.", "I kept the coffee coming."]], ["Navicce", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Navicce \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/581/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Navicce \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/015/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Navicce \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/016/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Navicce \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/859/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Nowadays office buildings, warehouses, stadiums become bigger and more complex. Quite a few people find it confusing to easily navigate through this constructions.</p>\n<p>One of many questions which Google asks its interns on interview is \"How to go from point A to point B if you don't know the way?\" Many interviewees answer \"I will call a taxi\". But what if both of those points are inside the same building? Navicce will easily solve this problem for you.</p>\n<p>Just imagine \u2013 you have important meeting in office center, which consists of 6 buildings, each having 80 floors and over 60 offices on each floor. The only thing you know about your suggested destination is that you need to be in conference room 6 in office of company A. With Navicce all you have to do is to type this into the search field and find gyroscooter which will be provided for you. The system will take you right to the doors of mentioned office. While Navicce does all the job of navigating and transporting for you, you can even read news or get ready for the meeting.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Navicce uses indoor maps and autopiloted vehicles to help people find way to their destination in a building. The only thing user should do is to point his destination and go to the vehicle station \u2013 place where our vehicles are stored, which is located near places with biggest flow of people, such as entrances of the building or near elevators. After coming to the station, user just stands up on the vehicle and autopiloted system transports him to specified destination.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>There are three core parts of Navicce:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Custom map builder. It allows owner of the building to create indoor map with our format in easy and fast way. It needs only map of building, which is usually already done for emergency purposes, and small amount of time to point out walls. \n(Unn.png)</li>\n<li>Routing. Our first choice for routing engine was EMBERS Routing API, which we wanted to scale down to one office center or even one building. Unfortunately, we found that Routing API works only with outdoor routing, but indoor routing can be a good way for further development. We implemented our own algorythm, which works on small example data, but we believe that we can integrate EMBERS API for further scaling to bigger buildings.</li>\n<li>Autopiloted vehicles. In conditions of hackathon, we were unable to create full-scale prototype of our system, but we found some ready solutions, implemented with piloted gyroscooters. It can be easily attached to our system later as we have all needed infrastructure.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the main problems was to make our mobile application user-friendly.

We came up with the following scenarios. </p>\n<h3>Niel Non-trendy user</h3>\n<p>He doesn't have any knowledge about fashion. He usually wears the same clothes and if he gets any new ones, he will usually shop with his mom. Now, he would need a fashionable look for a party whose dress code is \"smart casual\". He wants to spend the minimum effort in shopping and he's quite clueless what to even buy.</p>\n<h3>Felicia Fashionista</h3>\n<p>This user knows exactly her style. She follows fashion and has a lot of fashionable clothes. Now she would like to find more trousers that fit her existing shirts.</p>\n<h3>Mama Marie</h3>\n<p>She has two children who desperately need more clothes as they grow out of the previous ones. Her kids aren't old enough to have their own preferences. She wants to find clothes that look nice enough but that don't break the budget.</p>\n<h2>Existing solutions</h2>\n<p>Most of the time, finding nice clothes in an online shop is a tedious and time consuming process. The user is presented with a massive amount of images of different clothes together with terminology that is not easily understandable to a user who doesn't know too much about clothes, e.g. what is the difference between skinny fit and slim fit jeans.</p>\n<p>Some online shops for clothes do offer cohesive looks with customisation to some extent. Zalando has such a tool already. However, Zalando's tool fails to take into account the user's budget and it doesn't make the browsing an easy task. First you have to find a ready made look that is appealing to you and then you can start to customise it hoping that the look will stay fashionable after your customisations. It also falls short in providing the user with a look to match the user's needs; complete looks are difficult to find and browse by type (streetwear, casual...).</p>\n<h2>Our solution</h2>\n<p>Our solution is a trained machine-learning model that combines individual clothes into complete looks accordingly to the user's needs such as their budget and the type of clothing they are looking for (smart casual, office clothes...). Furthermore, the application lets the user change clothes in the look by recommending other clothes, such as shirts, that go well with the rest of the look, i.e. the trousers and shoes.</p>\n<p>Our method takes care of that all the pieces of clothing it suggests dovetail into each other resulting always in a fashionable, cohesive look. Users can even look for complete outfits by uploading an image of a person wearing fashionable clothes.</p>\n<p>In the future, we will let the user login with their Zalando account which makes it possible for them to bring the clothes they have already purchased from Zalando to the system. This way, they can find matching clothes to the ones they already have, completing their looks to the max of fashion. This gives the user more reason to continue buying from Zalando. If he buys his clothes from Zalando, he can benefit from the system when he wants to buy new clothes that match the old ones.</p>\n<h2>The algorithm</h2>\n<p>The algorithm elaborates a set of clothes that all can be selected to make a cohesive, vogue look based on the user's needs. In order to do so it queries Zalando's API to search for clothes and their recommendations. It uses a machine vision approach trained by Zalando's products to find similar items to expand the recommendations it got from the API.</p>\n<p>We trained two machine vision models: one to find similar products based on the product image and the other to find matching outfits in Zalando where a person was wearing fashionable clothes. The formal model was trained using 2221 product images, whereas the later was trained using 1138 images of models wearing Zalando's products.</p>\n<p>The final recommendations shown to the user are chosen by comparing their colours to each other and how they fit together in the color wheel. This ensures that all the recommended clothes are fashionable together and a perfect match. To have a colour matching algorithm that is similar to human perception, we performed all colour operations on CIELAB colour space.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>There's only a limited amount of resources for fashion. Most of the time you would need to work with pictures which complicates the whole process of finding fashionable clothes automatically.</p>\n<p>The API doesn't provide nearly enough functionality for our needs so we had to overcome the issues by workarounds. </p>\n<p>Machine learning together with tailoring the UI posed tremendous challenges. Ensuring the the user has an easy time browsing the clothes and that the suggested clothes are actually fashionable and go well together were the greatest challenges throughout the project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>In addition to learning about web technologies such as django, jquery, bootstrap and mongodb, we learned quite a deal about building a functional prototype fast. We learned that you shouldn't just jump right into coding but instead invest plenty of time in prototyping, understanding your potential users and existing solutions.</p>\n<p>Prototyping and frameworks weren't the only learning outcome. A great deal of trial and error went into building the machine learning model. Staring from feature extraction to actually processing images was an uncharted territory to us and thus it turned out to be an extremely educational venture.</p>\n<p>We didn't step out of our comfort-zone just in the machine learning part, but we also looked into the artistic and learned about the science behind matching colours. In doing so, we learned the principles of using colours in design. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag

Looks even better live! :)</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The hormonal system of the human body is complex, and many outside factors affect things like blood glucose levels. People with diabetes need to self control their blood glucose levels. To do that, they need to learn what makes the blood glucose rise and go down.</p>\n<p>Wellness trackers provide easy, perhaps fully automated, or even fun ways to track many signals. Learning from that data, and converting the information into behavior change is still a challenge.</p>\n<p>We believe Personal Health Records like Omakanta make it easier for innovative companies to develop services that help make sense of all the data. PHRs foster collaboration between companies, and put people in the center of it all, allowing citizens to control where their data is used and how. We hope to see ecosystems emerging on top of these platforms.</p>\n<p>For instance, Mikael from our team has a startup Sensotrend that concentrates on making life easier and providing insights for one small user group (insulin-dependent people with diabetes) really well. He still sees that people with diabetes are all individuals with their own needs and challenges, and there's no way one app or service can solve all of those. People need to be able to choose from a variety of apps, that can all work with the same set of collected data.</p>\n<p>The real <strong>health benefits</strong> and <strong>business case</strong> for services like this come from the way we enable healthcare organizations take a major step towards digitalization.</p>\n<p>Healthcare organizations can already separate their customers (the patients) into segments. Most people with chronic conditions are already empowered and independent, and capable of managing their own condition independently. Only a small minority requires all the possible attention.</p>\n<p>To be able to categorize people with chronic conditions, and to keep tracking the categorization (things change in life, as we know), the organizations need the self-monitored and self-reported data from these people. People will submit their information when provided with easy-to-use tools that bring them real value (like ours), even more so when rewarded with benefits like possibility to manage appointments and ordering supplies autonomously. Healthcare organizations can enable these features for people who do submit their self-measurement data often enough, go take their lab results regularly, and don't have hospitalizations or other events warranting a meeting with a healthcare professional.</p>\n<p>With the help of this categorization, <strong>healthcare organizations can reduce cost from where it is not required</strong> (over-serving people that do well) and target their resources in a meaningful way. This is the easiest place to save. It also has the most potential for saving. And it's logical to start the digitalization efforts with this user group, that contains the natural early adopters.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We take information from wellness apps and devices (in this case Oura ring and a continous glucose monitor and an insulin pump system) and visualizes that information together. So people with diabetes can see and learn, for instance, how lack of recovery causes stress, which causes blood glucose to rise, and how that can (once you understand the cause) controlled with medication, but also with changes in behavior.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We're using open source components Nightscout (nightscout.info), xDrip (<a href=\"http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/</a>), and other components (<a href=\"https://github.com/pazaan/640gAndroidUploader\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/pazaan/640gAndroidUploader</a>) built by the #WeAreNotWaiting community (see <a href=\"http://www.healthline.com/health/diabetesmine/innovation/we-are-not-waiting\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.healthline.com/health/diabetesmine/innovation/we-are-not-waiting</a>) to read data from medical devices.</p>\n<p>We're integrating directly to the cloud API of the <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oura</a> ring, as well as some other wellness trackers, and use aggregator services like <a href=\"http://www.wellmo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wellmo</a> to extend our support to dozens of different apps and devices, as well as manual tracking. Wide coverage of supported apps and devices gives our users the freedom to choose the tools that best suit their individual lifestyles. We believe this is absolutely essential!</p>\n<p>We use <a href=\"http://www.sensotrend.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sensotrend</a>'s exising technology to fetch the data and mash it up as insightful visualizations. We don't store any data in our (or Sensotrend's) service, rather fetch it from wellness apps directly, and store medical data to <a href=\"http://www.kanta.fi/en/web/ammattilaisille/omakannan-omatietovarannon-maarittelyt\" rel=\"nofollow\">KanTa</a> (or <a href=\"http://www.taltioni.fi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taltioni</a>, another Personal Health Record system). This way the data is always in full control of the citizen.</p>\n<p>Both KanTa and Oura connections were built from scratch during the Junction hackathon, demonstrating how easy it is to integrate systems. Almost all modern API's are based on OAuth2 authentication and authorization, JSON data format and REST calls.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>KanTa system had a problem with the firewall, not all interfaces were fully functional for developers outside the organization (with a VPN access, everything works...). Oura system worked well for us initially, but some other developers required more relaxed security features, and when Oura enabled those it caused some trouble for us.</p>\n<p>A very positive challenge was that we weren't able to fully concentrate on hacking, as there was a semi-constant stream of partners, people interested in diabetes treatment, and especially government officials, allowing us to discuss and share our vision of the emerging ecosystems on Personal Health Record platforms.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We had very good discussion and feedback both ways with both KanTa and Oura representatives. We hope we have given them valuable feedback, and also encouragement that their APIs and services are really required and being used. The same for us, we've received a lot of feedback stating that there is a true need for services like ours.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We had some interoperability issues with both Oura and KanTa. Even when an API is well specified and tested internally in an organization, you can really tell whether it works after you bring it to a hackathon or interoperability event.</p>\n<h2>What's next for diabetesdata</h2>\n<p>We're actively participating in the development of KanTa system, building integrations to sandbox environments and helping define the data structures. We are also eagerly waiting for the production environment to become available. We're also continuing our discussions with the public healthcare organizations, and plan to bring our service (or services) online in production as soon as KanTa is ready for it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">oura</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kanta</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/fhir\">fhir</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">oauth2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nightscout</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jelastic\">jelastic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/redux\">redux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">radix</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">diabeto</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mikael-junction2016.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mikael-junction2016.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mikael-junction2016.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://junction2016diabetesdata.online/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://junction2016diabetesdata.online/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>junction2016diabetesdata.online</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Neovectio", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows to monitorize the people that its inside a bus and the bus stop where they are going to leave, the people that is waiting for a bus and the people that will catch a bus on the following stops.</p>\n<p>With that data, we populate usefol information on the bus stop screens and act with that information.</p>\n<p>Also, on our own cloud we change dinamically the bus lines, removing some of the bus stops and making it more smart.

Preparing yourself for these high seasons it\u2019s difficult and even more if you have to focus on a subject you absolutely dislike.\nTo avoid getting over-stressed, we got distracted so easily. Our most dangerous enemy it\u2019s our phone. We\u2019re constantly receiving tons of notifications of social media apps, our email or the weather forecast. Despite we try to make our best effort, it is not common to stay concentered for long periods at the same level.\nWe\u2019ve been asking some hackers here at Junction: most of them said they normally are focused on what they\u2019re doing while it is of its interest, and also, they agreed that their distractions increase while the interest decreases. </p>\n<p>As students, we wanted to give a solution to this problem. We decided to create a bot, using Microsoft Bot API, which helps you organizing your schedule and your tasks. It works hand by hand with a ghost android App which take control over your smartphone by blocking it and avoiding you to access it. (Except for emergency case, of course).\nThe phone can be block by programing an schedule or at the moment for a custom amount of minutes/hours. Once is block, it doesn\u2019t allow you to write your pin code or draw the pattern by replacing the lock screen with a custom window. And it\u2019ll only unlock itself at the end of the schedule or every 25 min for 5 min to give you some breaks.\nThe bot adds some functionalities, which the main one is create an schedule for your duties. Divided in three categories, you can manage to reproduce your university/school timetable subject by subject, program all exams and/or all your assignments.\nIt can also give you the list of all future activities and/or the next you have programmed, and even how much time is left for an specific task to be started. It helps you giving you a more graphic idea of how much free time you will dispose, and when. - The third functionality is to erase activities for any reason are cancelled.</p>\n<p>We built our project using Node.js, Android and the Microsoft Bot API with the Natural Language Recognition API (or LUIS).  We use Skype to communicate via life chat with the bot. The backend host by Azure send callback functions to the ghost application who take control over you device.</p>\n<p>We had to face issues and problems that challenged us as we had no previous experience both with Microsoft Bot and Azure. So we\u2019re glad we didn\u2019t give up and managed to solve it. We have to admit we couldn\u2019t solve some of them if it weren\u2019t for the help we received from the Skype partners who came to Junction.</p>\n<p>This project it is only a prototype compare on what can become. We hope we help students worldwide and make thier studying experience better, and we belive Focus can be far extended adding uncountable features,</p>\n<p>We're so glad we develope such project as Focus as it opens us a new door to the AI-bot world we hadn't worked on before Junction. Bots are a crutial tool we'll have to get used to, so we want to be familiar with them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

Only when you approach (system detects nearby front facing user) does it scale the current global campaign to half size and opens up the interactive information kiosk and local community message board.

At night? Here's an event and locals clubs. Reading neighbors messages? Here's a community project or cultural event. Just posted a status update involving food related keywords?

I believe that is where we grow and thrive. Wandering around the city brings me joy. Both chaotic and organized districts have their own stories, those stories then reflect the characteristics of the people who are raised in these places, isn't it fascinating? A cup of coffee to go, walking along streets downtown, smiling at the person who is walking towards you, isn't it just pleasant?\nI want to have others, the urban dwellers to enjoy the rich culture and simple joy the city offers to us. Therefore, I wanted to show them the beauty of the city, of Helsinki. Meanwhile, there are many people in urban region are having sedentary lifestyles, I hope by showing interesting regions I can encourage people to be more active. Last but not least, although I like the urban area much, urbanization has created so many problems to the environment and jeopardized human's well-being. Time like this, we need to take responsibility of improving the urban environment, by promoting walking, I hope people can reduce use of motorized vehicles, which can potentially help the city be greener and safer.\nI hope through my effort, citizens can be motivated to learn more about Helsinki, the city we all live in and attracted to. Ultimately, everyone can actively involve in making Helsinki a better place, and create the HEL we deserve :)</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Currently, walkable-hel offers different features (nightlife, school, restaurants, shopping center, tourist attraction and nature) in Helsinki downtown. User can choose the features she/he is interested in, and creates a personalized walkability map of Helsinki downtown.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>walkable-hel is a simple visualization. So building the web application was not very difficult. We used leaflet as the main library to support web map application. The tricky part is getting the right data and processing it so the data is ready use for visualization. I got most of the data through OpenStreetMap, some through HSL. The former has many entries, makes it difficult to process. The latter one is not well-defined, makes it equally difficult.

It's not easy to work on a project when you have to stop coding several times to get some hot water.</li>\n<li>Oura's ring:\nThe main problem we had with the ring was that we didn't know if it was correctly synchronized with the smartphone because sometimes the App told us that the ring's battery was 0%, but about 1 minute later it was 100%. Finally we realized that we wrongly connected our smartphone with another ring that was near of us.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>After hours of hard working, we've created some cool bar graphics with Android based on the information the ring obtained. </li>\n<li>We've chosen two different things and worked with them until we got one simple but really cool idea.</li>\n<li>We've had fun, worked a lot but also finished the project.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We've improved some skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We learned some new Android and Java concepts like Retrofit and Json. At first, it took us a while understanding how does it work, but with a big effort we did it!</li>\n<li>Due to the great communication we have, we could transfer our knowledge between us and improve team working skills. So that's a good way of learning from each other. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Wake cup.</h2>\n<p>Some ideas came up while coding but there wasn't enough time. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>We've thought of using the screen to pop up important messages, like some stuff the owner of the cup couldn't forget.</li>\n<li>The sleep activity brings many possibilities for developing new ideas with this device. We thought about studying the connection between the amount of sleep a person gets and the weather of that particular day.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gson\">gson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">oura's-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muki's-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Yonimevicio/MakeCup\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Yonimevicio/MakeCup\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Cristian and I have been working on the frontend, we used Android Studio and the Muki's API. \nBut half of the time I've been heating water for the Muki cup to get charged.", "I worked on the backend with Toni.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Have you ever missed a bus and have been caught up waiting with no things around except the bus stop? Isn't it boring to have the smartest technologies in the world and still having plain static ads shown on the bus stop billboards? Why the content creators are deprived of the tools and capabilities which mobile app developers have? We believe it is a time to open a new vision, the vision where ad creators become app developers having the opportunity to deliver engaging, IOT enabled and context based ads frictionlessly. We introduce visionOS.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>At its roots visionOS is an operating system running inside the JCDecaux bus stop. It provides the essential API services to let ad creators access data from various sensors like camera, motion tracking and thermometers. In addition, visionOS makes it possible to include third party API's into the app like Deezer, Snapchat or Swarm.</p>\n<p>All uploaded ads to the JCDecaux content server are then uploaded to the bus stations running visionOS. Ads have metadata configured before it is uploaded to the JCDecaux CMS. The data defines to which stations it must be sent (Finland, Sweden, France, Germany \u2026 maybe all. It is possible to configure targeting on the per-station basis). Vision OS runs the ads one by one and checks two conditions (questions).</p>\n<p>Should the ad be shown at this moment of time?\nWhat is the money proposal for being shown?</p>\n<p>The add to be shown is analysing the environment by using visionOS sensors API. The criteria includes: </p>\n<p>Location and recent news (near a conference?) -----&gt; show a car ad\nWeather ---&gt; raining ? -----&gt; show umbrellas\nBuses are late? -----&gt;  Show a car ad if people are at the stop</p>\n<p>And any other criterias, the advertiser wants to consider. Apps have full access to the Internet and can evaluate any condition to get their value proposition right. </p>\n<p>The content and the way how IOT and third party API's are used are up to developer what generates a great space for creativity.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built visionOS with the help of Unity technologies and prototyping tools like Sketch. Along with the project we created the sample use cases for engaging ad campaign.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Unity learning took a significant chunk of time. If we were to do it again, we would use web-based solutions, for example, we could write a web-only app to show demo.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Amazingly engaging ad examples showing the full creativity potential of the system. Clear business vision how visionOS will transform ad business. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Unity, rapid prototyping, brainstorming and idea validation.</p>\n<h2>What's next for visionOS</h2>\n<p>We genuinely believe that visionOS will transform the way how ads work.

A swift 3 app is scalable and contains some image recognition algorithms and provides a comfortable interaction with the REST API.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Quite a lot about teamwork in extreme situations. Also we've learnt some interesting things from image recognition, like different color distance algorithms. We really enjoyed the process of thinking of an algorithm and development of the working service itself. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Zalando Wardrobe</h2>\n<p>We are planning to add some Machine Learning algorithms to make an app's recommendations fit each user's taste better, based on what sets of clothes they like the most. Nevertheless, Zalando promised an API, which will make the mapping of real clothes with ones in their database possible. This will definetely make the process of adding the clothes to the wardrobe easier - user will just scan a bar code. Also it's possible to aggregate different shops inside one app to make the database of available clothes bigger. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/zalando\">zalando</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Ostrenkiy/ZalandoWardrobe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Ostrenkiy/ZalandoWardrobe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/beaverkiria/zalando-wardrobe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/beaverkiria/zalando-wardrobe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on iOS app, especially on engineering and API interaction.

A preliminary unified approach to these two parts of the program should be present.</p>\n<p>With proper recent hardware able to encode webm and a cable connection the system is able to push lossless display feeds with sub 0.5s latency through Ethernet. </p>\n<p>On constrained WiFi or 10 year old CPUs, it's able to stream the computer's display with reasonable quality, which is more than we ever imagined possible. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Streaming low latency video in 2016 through the web is sadly impossible.</p>\n<p>The challenges were many and apparently unsolvable according to the status quo.</p>\n<p>But we tried anyway.</p>\n<p>Our first goal was to minimize encoding delay. The video taken from the screen had to be compressed, and that takes time. ffmpeg is probably the most undocumented piece of black magic ever known to mankind, and getting through it used up our mind the entire 2 days of the hack.</p>\n<p>Gathering configuration options and endless trial and error succeeded into creating the perfect ffmpeg command to get a screen and push it. On Core2Duo systems usually incapable of encoding at more than 3 FPS.</p>\n<p>We wanted to make the GUI for the app in Electron, however we found out the hard truth then. Using web technologies, the only way to stream is to use webm (vp8/vp9) or a pure RTMP stream in the old, dead flash player. </p>\n<p>The first proved challenging considering our computers didn't have hardware encoders for webm (and nobody does, since those first started appearing last year!)  Direct PC to stream proved impossible, so a middleman had to happen. </p>\n<p>Software encoding webm on a system that was already running under load was ridiculous. Even when unconstrained, it would add massive input lag. </p>\n<p>The grasp of Adobe into streaming was so large streaming can't be conceived without them. RTMP was made to be a protocol used by them and Flash Player, but many open source implementations of it have started to appear. Browsers, however, don't support it. We tried many different implementations and approaches for an entire day, but in the end, without any other options, we moved onto a native display.</p>\n<p>It'd be easy to think this would solve all of our problems, but truth is, they hadn't even started.</p>\n<p>MPlayer is the only video player capable of streaming low latency video, period. No other player can, we are unsure why we as a species got to that point, but that's how things are. It also needs launch parameters that tell it to disable most of its functionality, and lose some quality. All in the name of low input lag.</p>\n<p>Better, newer hardware would've made things easier for us, as our computers were simply not powerful enough to be considered worthy of streaming anything. But in the end, it worked. </p>\n<p>Maybe a little too close to the end because we ran out of time!</p>\n<p>The python communication of keystrokes is not completely finished, mainly because it's our third one (the first one ran on nodejs for electron, then we had another one in regular js!) thanks to the constant scrapping of platforms. Thanks to streaming not being in HTML5, or anywhere in the web.</p>\n<p>But how do Twitch and YouTube do it?</p>\n<p>They have massive encoding lag. Twitch moved recently from pure RTMP to mp4 streams and the suffer now from almost minute long delays. YouTube is lower, but it has massive server farms powering it hundreds of times more powerful than regular laptops.</p>\n<p>The other similar services for screen streaming locally have similar tricks in the ffmpeg bag, adding custom silicon for decoding/encoding to further minimize lag. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We got within an inch of them in two days, which is awesome!</p>\n<p>Seeing how we got stream delay from 20 seconds to .2 was amazing, and so was watching my laptop's screen on my friend's computer. </p>\n<p>We actually got to learn lots of useful languages, and techniques. Some of them were a bit niche, but actually quite useful.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the intricacies of ffmpeg, video streaming, python, pygtk, javascript, some more nodejs for server usage, keyboard and mouse capture... we scripted them with xdotool, even programmed a bit of Junction Plays Pokemon to be demoed if the time came. We had a lot of fun doing all of this.</p>\n<p>For some reason Ruben's laptop kept nuking the HDD's MBR and it required GRUB to be reinstalled every boot. We tried not to reboot it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for FastMirror</h2>\n<p>Finish the mouse handling! It needs to be able to actually play FPS games, not just RPGs. It will also get proper per-platform hardware encoding and decoding once we get back to our main rigs.</p>\n<p>(Let's not talk about 6AM ssh'ing into your home 2000km away trying to get vdpau parameters)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ffmpeg\">ffmpeg</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">arch-linux</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">netcat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sockets</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mplayer</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rtmp</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I mostly hacked ffmpeg to work.

We wanted to turn that time into something useful. Why not help others while waiting for a bus..sound good?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using touch screen at bus stop it let's idle people (who are waiting for bus) put that time into filling out survey to donate money to charity.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Used: HTML CSS Typeform inscape and MS AZURE. Using Bus stop touchscreen we place product survey into HTML script. When survey is being filled out, user uses button at bottom, that sends info to database. Visual structure was being tweaked by Inkscape.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>For us the biggest challenge was to explain the idea how one can donate money that they dont own just by pressing buttons while waiting for bus. Ofcourse there' s alot more to that than user might think (precise audience targeting by companies that are paying for surveys, helping others by donations,  using spare time to something useful, development of bus station as it self, development of data analasys and marketing ways, provocating people to look socially good, development of JCD business).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>Development of the idea this kind. Its not a win-win. Its a win-win-win all over... We're proud that with marketing tool like this it motivates companies not to just put money into marketing but put it in a way that promotes company AND donates to charity at same time. Why would you do it any other way than this?</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about technologies that can be implemented in bus stops and operating systems, that are being used to power advertising screens. Research about paid surveys also showed that they are quite valuable for companies and the overall amount of money donated over time might be quite meaningful. This challenge also gave us new insights into coding and designing.</p>\n<h2>Business viability</h2>\n<p>The money, of course, comes from companies that want to conduct any kind of targeted research. The possibilities are limitless, because surveys can be placed in distinguished areas (near a bar, sports center, university etc.). After receiving the needed quantity of responses, a fixed amount of money can be sent to charity and also to the owner of bus stop ad space.  This kind of advertising would be superior to usual online surveys because of the  placement, surveys would be filled much quicker, respondent would be socially driven to help therefore would answer honestly and would be tempted to use time he has to wait for public transport.</p>\n<h2>BEFORE VISITING OUR DEMO WEBSITE</h2>\n<p>The project is made for bus stop screen with aspect radio of 9:16 so, for best experience, adjust your browser window accordingly.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">radix</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/inkscape\">inkscape</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://projectphlox.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://projectphlox.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>projectphlox.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["GuessWho", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Could you ever imagine such boring thing as a bus stop to be entertaining, interactive and educational at the same time? Till now, bus stops have been platforms for advertisement, but what else could a bus stop be? We're excited to present you a way to change view of city and inspire people to explore local talented artists.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This bus stop application incorporates public data from city museums to provide its visitors with a great experience of learning local talents by means of a simple game. Bus stops visitors are proposed to guess authors of some pieces of art. All of the drawings are gathered from some local museums and galleries to attract people to visit these culture sites. In order to make navigation easier it also shows location of the gallery that exhibits the latest work of art from the screen.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Since the app itself is a web-application, we used quite common stack of technologies: html + css + js for front-end and python + tornado as back-end.\nWe fetched content from Finnish National Gallery that provides oped data for works of art presented in it:\n<a href=\"http://kokoelmat.fng.fi/api/v2support/docs/#/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a></p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We continuously tried to put ourselves in position of bus stops visitors. Our main efforts were connected with providing as smooth user experience as possible. Application interface was significantly simplified in order to make it accessible for everybody. It turned out to be challenging to find a way of building application workflow so that process of bus stop screen usage remains a continuous process. Another important task was to avoid molestation with useless information. Modern cities are overloaded with advertising and political agitations but lack truly beautiful and peaceful spots. So creation of minimalistic design that just can't annoy somebody was another key factor.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are truly proud of our idea that allows to solve multiple important problems. Our project brings art to the masses and helps to promote unknown local talents. It helps people to tolerate long periods of public transport waiting. And it just simply decorates your city making it the biggest alfresco museum.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it is really hard to implement front end in a team of 5 data scientists.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GuessWho</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we want to extend our database of pieces of art so it will contain works of artists from all over the world. It will allow us to push our ideas to another cities. But in order to do it, it is extremely important to show all the other galleries and museums that moving towards publicly available data is a great tendency. \nSecondly, we don't want to limit ourselves by popularizing work of painters only, but also extend it with work of famous writers and public figures.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tornado\">tornado</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Alpus/jcd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Alpus/jcd\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://guesswho.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://guesswho.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>guesswho.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["CashX", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashX \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/004/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Cover</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashX \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/003/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Opening Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashX \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/001/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Chat Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CashX \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/002/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Other post</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When you come back from holidays or trips from another country you always have cash left from the local currency.

He got the key from a keybox and the PIN via text message from the host. Everything worked out well. After two month, he passed that flat again and just for fun typed in the same PIN he got earlier. When he figured out that it was still the same PIN it was an alarming event, as this is a huge security issue. So he came up with the idea for AirKeyNtry.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a physical keystore but in difference to already existing ones, it is equipped with a GSM module. Thus, it is possible to change the PIN to open the box remotely via a smartphone application.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>To build the box we used Autodesk Fusion 360 and 3D-Printers. The hardware in the box is powered by a Raspberry PI which we hooked up with a number pad and a GSM-Module. The app is written as a native Android application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Setting up the hardware environment and get everything working together.

A lot of daily tasks at the building is mostly done manually despite the advancement of technology and therefore with the help of sensors around the buildings, we could reduce the amount of redundant work tasks for employees to focus on what they are good at. This will further motivate the employees of the buildings to increase the work efficiency and satisfaction of work placement.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Meeting optimizer uses the user's input specification such as date, time, the profile of invited people, the number of people and the type of the meeting to search for the best ranked meeting room to choose from. This will reduce the redundant tasks of going through a list of unsuitable meeting rooms to choose from and in return it shows the best suited top 3 meeting rooms. The less options make the decision making process quicker and easier.  Using what the user has chosen for the room provides a valuable data to feed the intelligent machine to learn about what this particular user has chosen for a set of specifications (e.g. date, time, invited people profile, number of people invited) later on. This training data will be used to rank the meeting rooms according to the users' preferences to facilitate an excellent environment for effective and fun meeting. Furthermore, this will help reduce the resources for the building facilitators to allocate the resources more efficiently by duplicating the most popular room options models and by reducing the most undesired meeting room models. On our User Interface, the floorplan shows the intensity of colours to tell the users how frequently the desks or rooms are used by the employees using the data collected from the sensors.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used node.js for the backend and html, css, jquery, and javascript for the frontend. The semantic ui css framework is used for the improved User Experience. We also used CubiCasa Content Platform to provide floor plan material as svg file and tieto data API guides to learn about what kind of data is available to implement. The floor plan shows a visually beautiful and informative data about the desk and meeting room usage. This helps the decision making leaders to decide what rooms are serving the best for their employees' needs. The Floor plan has rooms and desks as elements to click on and it contains information about the frequency of usage, the capacity of room, is it being used, and when they are booked for. This information for each room is used in our algorithm to show the best options to choose from.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Not enough time and sleep. The data was not sufficient to get for our project and therefore we needed to create an example data to work with.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Visually showing the building data to convey the information quickly to the users. The seamless and easy meeting room booking flow to reduce the amount of time spent on creating event and reserving meeting rooms. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt the use of building data and data structure. How to implement User Friendly features to make an intuitive app. Taking raw data and turn them into valuable information to show them visually appealing as well as intuitive to the users. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Meeting Optimizer</h2>\n<p>Implementing Machine Learning to learn the user's preferences on which rooms are most wanted and used.

First of all, we have disassembled vehicle and only after 24h we've prepared it. And after this vehicle works for around 20 minutes, before battery spoiled :) We used dirty hardware hack with drone batteries to solve this.\nWe havn't choosen combo of 2 GoPro because of hard solving addressation problem (we cannot set different IP addresses without reflashing it), so we tried to use GoPro + Xiaomi YI combo. Merging 2 streams with different protocols (rtp for GoPro and rstp for Xiaomi) was also a challenge. We solved it using Skype and screen sharing from computer with both stream opened (btw this computer has 3 physical wi-fi adapters).\nParallel, we tried to capture some usefull information from neural interface. After connecting Muse to PC (first we worked with android version, for whole saturday) we figured out, that we used it wrong (it had very high error rate on two sensors). We tried 2 approaches to solve this challenge - structural and with machine learning  support. Finally, we used structural principle.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>Solving this challenges in field of hardware, VR, algorithms for neural data processing.

But that idea did not convinced us very much. After some other ideas we decided to <strong>split the team</strong>. Finally, I am here <strong>by my self</strong> with this idea. Helps people to <strong>order their food</strong> with a friendly user interface and pay their order before going to the restaurant or whenever they want to.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Find places nearby that may interest you</strong> and can show each restaurant's menus. But that part it is not implemented.</p>\n<p>Using that, people could be able to <strong>go to a restaurant with friends and pay without caring about the receipt</strong>.</p>\n<p>Usually that receipt have the total amount and each friend of that meeting have to pay his part. Having the menu information and the order in the phone, you could check what you ate/drank and pay it to the restaurant or to one friend (who pays all the bill at the end).</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Just <strong>Android</strong>, Firebase may help for the restaurant's menu, but the deadline is very near and I can not do that alone. I used View Pager for the main view and simple <strong>Material Design</strong> (by Google) palettes to select the color of the image and the background.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Decide to do it all by my self just 18h before the deadline. For the rest, like <strong>Http Requests and Image Loader</strong> I used libraries.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p><strong>Doing that project in 12h</strong> and having a cute interface, user friendly too.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Nothing at all, but I had a lot of fun. I like the <strong>design of the app</strong>. Next time I will try to find some technology to do an easy backend. </p>\n<h2>What's next for FeedMe</h2>\n<p>Adding menu for each restaurant and paying with friends (or alone) from the phone. Using some bank transfer app like Verse or Transfer Wise.</p>\n<p>Also the restaurants may need an admin panel with all the orders they have and some place to insert, update and delete items on their menu.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/felixarpa/FeedMe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/felixarpa/FeedMe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["All the work: Design, icon research, android implementation, idea, etc."]], ["Harambe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Harambe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/517/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Whoops!

Building data seemed very hands-on and diverse. It was interesting and fun to think all the possibilities how to use and analyse the data.</p>\n<h3>What it does</h3>\n<p>Turboclean is a mobile app prototype that helps building maintenance companies to avoid unnecessary job tasks, prioritise daily work and also enhance customer experience. It does this with utilising various IoT sensors and the massive real-time data they provide, for example measuring the consumption of toilet paper or usage of common office spaces. As another cool feature we implemented possibility to alert maintenance personnel in urgent situations by using Bttn's IoT hardware.</p>\n<h3>How we built it</h3>\n<p>We started by analysing the data and envisioning the everyday challenges of maintenance business. We wanted to focus on end-users so first we decided to build an application for janitors. After short discussion we started building a mobile web app with Node.JS and React. During the development process we used Trello to organise work and to prioritise certain features.</p>\n<h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>\n<p>The biggest single challenge was a bit surprisingly deploying application to Heroku, maybe because we didn't pay enough attention to it from the beginning and that caused unexpected delays to schedule (and yes, we also tried Azure without any better results). Some challenges also were caused by different coding practices and backgrounds. We also had some techinal issues with our laptops, like one corrupted C:\\ drive... :)</p>\n<h3>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3>\n<p>Despite all the challenges, the final prototype is not just a bunch of fancy features put together, but rather a cohesive and working piece of software. We are also proud of our intuitive and good-looking UI, which isn't something to be expected by a team of developers. Our team also managed to develop a quite okay algorithm to prioritise tasks based on sensor data and distance from current location.</p>\n<h3>What we learned</h3>\n<p>Everyone of us learned a big bunch of new programming skills, technologies and teamwork skills. As a another new thing we experienced hacking with different hardware devices. Also version management and DevOps were relatively new to some of our team members. This was also the first hackathon for all of us, so the weekend was overall full of new ways of thinking and coding.</p>\n<p>So in this point of view, Junction was a huge success and we'll definitely participate hackathon again.</p>\n<h3>What's next for Turboclean</h3>\n<p>Our application could be easily modified to suit different work environments. It works best with separate tasks in different locations. Among the building maintenance the app could be used for example in gardening or security business. We hope that this project encourages people to utilise massive IoT data available in new innovative ways.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bttn</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tieto-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muki</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/trello\">trello</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://demo.turboclean.space\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://demo.turboclean.space\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>demo.turboclean.space</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/villevuor/turboclean\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/villevuor/turboclean\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did environment and deployment setup and was basically responsible for user experience.", "I mostly worked with backend: planned and created database structure and also managed some of the DevOps parts.One of my major tasks was also parsing sensor data from Tieto and importing it to our database for further processing.", "I am quite a beginner in development.

We are all familiar with services like Uber and Airbnb, but what about fashion? We all have a lot of different clothes just laying around in our apartments; clothes that we barely use. The grass is always greener on the other side, and we constantly want new items of clothing, so why not borrow from each other?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Co|wear is fashion-as-a-service product. By being able to lend, and lend out items of clothing to other people, users can find new clothes. The different kind of items are displayed in GoogleMaps with pins at their respective locations.</p>\n<p>If you like the item, similar items offered by Zalando are displayed. To spread the word and find new and exciting outfits, we have the Explore function. Explore allows the user to see the latest fashion pictures from Twitter. The user can then contact these fashionistas who aren't using co|wear and ask to borrow their clothes. We are essentially using existing social platforms to market our own.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the entire product using Javascript, with a frontend written in React.JS and a backend written in Node.JS. We use a mongoDB to store users and items. In the backend we implement and talk to both Zalando's API, as well as Twitter's API. In the frontend we use a GoogleMap to display the user's current position and your closest borrowable items.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One big challenge was to establish the scope of the project and what to focus on in the allotted time. We also used languages and frameworks (React.js) with which we had very little experience in order to learn. This felt like a fun challenge up until yesterday night at 2 in the morning.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the overall feeling of the product that we've managed to build in 48 hours. co|wear is currently a prototype, but the basic functionality is easily demonstrated through our code. We also feel that the idea has potential to shake up a very traditional market.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As always we have learned to work under pressure. It is a challenge to build something in 48 hours, and especially building something complex. We have also been given a lot of input from Zalando regarding their interests, and how we could make a business plan out of a simple idea.\nWe have used new programming tools, which have been both fun and frustrating - but in the end extremely rewarding.</p>\n<h2>What's next for co|wear</h2>\n<p>There is plenty of work left. We want to make it easier for people to purchase at Zalando using our service. We would also like to create efficient algorithms for the recommendation system, as it is a core revenue-creating functionality of the product. We also want to improve the ease at which we poach users from existing social platforms. Not to mention, to develop the business model on which the product is built. Intrigued?

Of course you have, because you don't have a ModSense power strip.\nDo you at least know how much power you are wasting with your electronics when you are not using them? Well... we can also help you with that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>ModSense is a smart, modular and connected power strip</strong>. You don't have to adjust to the product, the product adjusts to you. Add how many modules you need, to plug how many devices you want. All sockets have power measurement and can be turned on and off remotely, controlled in a web browser or by a mobile application. You can program your power strip to turn on/off the devices at a certain hour or under certain conditions ( e.g. the temperature in the room is above 25\u00baC, so you want to turn off the socket controlling the heater or if you shutdown your computer it can automatically turn off the peripherals). Because it is modular, each socket can have a different feature, like temperature sensing, air quality sensing, noise sensing or it can even act as a wifi repeater. All this data is sent to a server where it is accessible through a web browser and a mobile application where the communication works both ways.

Everybody likes solving some quiz questions or hearing some jokes but also playing some brain training games in their free time.

That works pretty well if you have the time to commit to it; the process includes annotating a set of sample images to match an outline model of what you are trying to recognise. I figured this would take too much time and I need to get something done quicker than that so I can determine if this project is even viable.</p>\n<p><strong>7pm</strong> I found a JS library that can detect features using Haar Cascades in an image or video stream. It works really well but I would have to train the haar classifier for different pieces of clothing my self; there aren't any readily available classifiers for that purpose I could find on the internet. With OpenCV it's fairly straightforward to train a haar classifier so I'm going to try that first. All I need is a large set of positive and negative image samples and I'm all set.</p>\n<p><strong>8pm</strong> Started exploring where I could get a large enough set of quality images for training. Zalando website has a few with white background. I reckon this kind of images are optimal for training a Haar Classifier. The official hackathon API at quick glance doesn't seem to provide enough suitable images and I'm definitely not going to download them by hand so I'm gonna have to find a way to automatically fetch the images. Let the hacking begin!</p>\n<p><strong>9pm</strong> I put together a small python script that fetches the page html with specific search queries. Using regex I can easily parse the product codes and point to a media url where I can download the images. Sweet! Moving right along.</p>\n<p><strong>10pm</strong> The downloaded images were mostly perfect frontal images of t-shirts and trousers with white background. Some of the downloaded images contained the model as well or some background noise. Have to manually remove the images that are no-good for training.</p>\n<p><strong>10:30pm</strong> Started training the haar cascade. This is going to take a long time unless I find some serious hardware physically or the cloud. Microsoft guys left already, I need to think of something. Meanwhile I'm going to focus on designing the UI!</p>\n<h3>Saturday</h3>\n<p><strong>1am</strong> I need to tweak the parameters for cascade training a bit. The CC was overtrained with 16 stages. I'm dropping to 8 and letting it run trough the night while I sleep. I'm trying to find some Microsoft guys to get me some cloud time to run the training algorithm. Everyone's asleep...</p>\n<p><strong>2am</strong> Working with the application UI with TouchstoneJS which is a traditional React app boilerplate but with no documentation. Getting strange errors from router and a bit tired after such a long coding spree. Going to go to sleep soon.</p>\n<p><strong>11am</strong> Back at it! The cascade was trained with 8 stages while I was sleeping and produced a result. Need to test it with js-objectdetect. If it works well enough this project will become totally viable so I'm getting excited.</p>\n<p><strong>1pm</strong> The results are not very impressive. I think I need a better dataset. If I could find images of t-shirts in different backgrounds and without it would be perfect. In that case I would need at least 50 positive images and 500 negative images. Hmm... need to explore possibilities.</p>\n<p><strong>2pm</strong> So I went on and took a total of 250 pictures (positive and negative samples) of Junction hackers who volunteered. Every volunteer had a t-shirt on so this project will probably be best for finding matching trousers for a t-shirt. Now I need to process the images and choose positives and negatives. Downscaling can be done with python. I need to think about the cropping part.</p>\n<p><strong>3pm</strong> I created a nice set of scripts for preprocessing the images via ImageMagick. This includes downscaling and cropping sections. I want to be able to train my cascade a bit faster with better accuracy (I'm fairly confident at this point that my dataset is OK enough). I talked to the guys at DataCenter and they were generous enough to give me access to their Jelastic cloud. I set up a container with 16 cloudlets for a total of 6.4GHz CPU power. Now I'm building OpenCV on the Ubuntu container. <code>make</code> seems to correctly utilize the available resources with the <code>-j</code> flag on. Just have to wait for it to finish to test the training performance. For this purpose I have to build <code>opencv</code> with the flag <code>WITH_TBB=ON</code> to allow multithreading.</p>\n<p><strong>4:30pm</strong> Build complete. Let's test!</p>\n<p><strong>5pm</strong> Training the cascade requires too much RAM, my process is getting killed by the platform. I'm unable to find DataCenter guys here to give me some more RAM. I might go with Azure. Meanwhile the local training was completed after ~6hrs. And testing the classifier produced a RESULT for the first time! The algorithm can detect t-shirts with moderate success. Having short sleeves and open arms with a U-neck works the best. The only thing to do is to apply some tweaking and we can determine the color of the shirt, which will be our main criteria for finding a matching pair of trousers.</p>\n<p><strong>6pm</strong> Apparently Atom's image preview interprets image orientation wrong so the rotate command I added in my preprocessing mixes up the detection a bit (the image needs to be tilted to work properly). I'm going to train a new cascade on Azure and tweak the parameters a bit. Whatever the result I will have to go with it. There's not enough time.</p>\n<p><strong>7pm</strong> Wow, setting up Azure was really a breeze. I set up an Ubuntu F16S virtual machine with 16 cores and 32GB memory with the Azure pass subscription. Compiling OpenCV from source took ~3 minutes as opposed to ~30 minutes in the DC Jelastic. Obviosuly more hardware = more power, so Azure is more fitted for this purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>7:20pm</strong> Omg. The training completed in ~10 minutes as opposed to ~6 hours on a standard 2015 MacBook Pro. Really awesome!! Thanks Microsoft!</p>\n<p><strong>9pm</strong> Implemented object capture from HTML5 video and tested on an android phone (Huawei Honor 8). Detection works, but the algorithm requires some tweaking due to a large number of false positives. When the image is moving (or a person wearing t-shirt moves past the image) it gets crazy. That's a good sign.</p>\n<p><strong>11pm</strong> The 12 hour coding spree is starting to take a toll on me. I'm just trying to wrap everything so I get a <em>demoable</em> app that looks good enough. I'm switching UI frameworks to BlockJS, a very lightweight prototyping framework written by me, to introduce less overhead.</p>\n<h3>Sunday</h3>\n<p><strong>1am</strong> Things are starting to look okay. I'm happy with how the UI/UX is starting to unfold. I've got most of the components planned and designed and half of them implemented. When I have integrated the Zalando API and bound data to elements I'm gonna go back to optimizing the classifier algorithm.</p>\n<p><strong>02:30am</strong> Starting to intergate Zalando API. Much to my dismay I found out that the API doesn't have a trousers category. I will have to match shirts with shoes instead.</p>\n<p><strong>05:30am</strong> Still at it. Can now determine the mean color of a t-shirt from an image. Should be enough for demo purposes if I can get a general color classifier done that works with the data returned from the Zalando API. Also I just realized I don't distinguish between men's and women's clothes. Need to think of something quickly!</p>\n<p><strong>7am</strong> I had to write a RGB to HSL color converter to determine the basic color from the mean value. The color classifier seems to work okay. Code quality is horrible at this point, but if it works it works! I've been coding for 20 hours straight. Phew. Still going <em>strong</em>...</p>\n<p><strong>8am</strong> Omg! It works. The app is now integrated with the APIs and classifiers and it gives exciting results. I would count this as success! It's not yet time to go to sleep however. Need to make sure that it works on Android and possibly create an .apk</p>\n<p><strong>10am</strong> After some preparation work for the demo, I published the webapp on <a href=\"http://fabmatch.online\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://fabmatch.online</a> (Thx Radix for the domain!). I didn't have time to build it into an .apk but it should be fairly straightforward later on. It works as a Home-Screen app with the standard web view, but introducing a crosswalk build will offer more power and smoother experience across all devices. These days hybrid apps perform really well if the correct technologies are chosen.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm most proud of my custom trained haar cascade. I had no real experience with OpenCV before and I managed to come up with something that works.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned to use microsoft Azure and Jelastic cloud. Training CV algorithms with custom datasets is no longer a mystery.</p>\n<p>I also learned that people will appreciate your cool idea and be ready to help you (by providing images of themselves for CV training) without hesitation. Always use the resources available around you in creative ways. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Fabmatch</h2>\n<p>More data = better image classification. I have a feeling that with the technology I built this could actually be a viable product. And it would probably work pretty well if the CV algorithm is trained with enough data.</p>\n<p>The business case for this application would be for partners to increase sales via recommendations to users. If the user finds real value from this app by finding clothes that they like more easily it would be wise for businesses to be part of the platform. They should provide APIs for their product catalog to be able to recommend products for the user.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/andreasur/fabmatch\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/andreasur/fabmatch\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://fabmatch.online\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fabmatch.online\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>fabmatch.online</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Forever alone ;__;"]], ["JobJob", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"JobJob \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/307/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>JobJob - Easygoing job search.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We we're frustrated with current recruitment processes from both sides: emphatisizing both the recruiter and the applicant.

In addition, it takes a lot of time if you are going to think about and control everything yourself. Smart systems are coming out more and more, but there are still no systems that fully automate everything, that's why we have created the EcoControl system.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The EcoControl system is a complete system for optimal control of lighting and power consumption both in homes and commercial buildings. The system saves electricity by automatic control of all your electrical appliances.</p>\n<h2>Lighting</h2>\n<p>The system has several sensors for optimal lighting control. The movement sensors automatically turn on the neighboring lights whenever motion is detected. All light installations in the system are dimmable and change the lighting throughout the day, so that lighting is not as bright in the evening before you are about to go to sleep as it is in the morning and midday when it helps you stay awake. Through light detection, it can also make the inside lights follow the natural outside lights throughout the day.</p>\n<h2>Temperature</h2>\n<p>The temperature sensors in the system work together with the heaters, to automatically turn on/off heaters adjusting to your set temperature. You can change your settings from anywhere you want, and through our WiFi enabled smart plug your changes will be sent to the heaters immediately. This system, together with the motion detection and scheduled timers, will optimize the heating in the building so that the temperature always is comfortable whenever anyone is in the building, but at the same time saves electricity by turning down the heat when everyone is gone.</p>\n<h2>Humidity</h2>\n<p>Humidity sensor automatically detects when rooms are getting too humid, and turn on dehumidifiers accordingly through our smart plug without any human interaction.</p>\n<h2>Device control</h2>\n<p>Through our WiFi enabled 230V smart plug, you can basically hook up anything you want to get automatically controlled by our system. The plug can react on events, and you could for example use it to turn on the coffee machine as soon as it detects movement in at the workplace.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first started out by reprogramming the SAMD21 using embedded c-programming in Atmel Studio. We added the functionality for pushing the light sensor data on the mesh network, and receiving messages to set the dimming level of the lights. In parallel, we also started programming the WiFi system-on-chip module, which controls the load. Also, at the same time we tested the Azure web services, tried to think what to hack with the Paulig Muki, and set up all of the necessary backend infrastructure for out idea to become realizable. 48 hard-work-no-sleep hours later, the result is awesome.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting an entire system working consisting of multiple languages and nodes. We litterally hacked this together. It was a fun experience with loads of challanges along the way.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>That it really pays off to be persistent and not give up before you make what you wanted. Teamwork is important and together we accomplish things we never could have done on our own. 3 people does not make it 3x times faster, it speeds up the development far more than that.</p>\n<h2>What's the next for EcoControl</h2>\n<p>The next steps and future implemetations for the EcoControl system is to add Non-Intrusive Appliance Load Monitors (NIALMs) that detects the power consumption of all appliances in the entire building. With just a few of these you can get full reports on the live status of the building and historical data and graphs. You will know exactly how much is used on heating, coffee making, charging of Teslas and so on. With our WiFi enabled plugs, you can then apply these to everything that uses a lot of electricity, and let our system do the rest of you and optimize your power consumption.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">super-stack</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tepcomp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">intelligentbuildings</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pauligmuki</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ge</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">embedded</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">engineering</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mqtt</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">radix</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kristapsdreija/Junction_nodeMCU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kristapsdreija/Junction_nodeMCU\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ecocontrol.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ecocontrol.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ecocontrol.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joahar/Junction_2016_Intelligent_Buildings_Challenge_SAMD21_Node\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joahar/Junction_2016_Intelligent_Buildings_Challenge_SAMD21_Node\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://freeboard.io/board/D1Ewyy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://freeboard.io/board/D1Ewyy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>freeboard.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on the Atmel SAMD21 board setting sending and receiving of the data we needed on the mesh network, and the presentation of the project.

Additionally, there are dozens of services to display your raw health data using fancy graphics and sophisticated animations. But why don\u2019t you use them?</p>\n<p>In a classical Finnish sauna business meeting, we figured out that the way to help you with your health is not to show you even more diagrams, bar charts and tables but to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\" rel=\"nofollow\">keep it simple (, stupid)</a>. That is why we came up with <strong>Ges::ndheit</strong>.</p>\n<p>Well, let us introduce <strong>Ges::ndheit</strong>:</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Ges::ndheit</strong> is the solution for all of your health problems. It\u2019s the swiss army knife of the personal assistant apps. It is the last ray of sun before the cold night (which is like 4pm in Finland).</p>\n<p><strong>Ges::ndheit</strong> solves the information overload of all those smart devices you own by reducing all of the available data into <strong>one clear personalized instruction</strong> on how <strong>you can improve your health</strong>. Those instructions vary from simple text-based recommendations up to adjustments of your SmartHome devices. The personalized instructions are constructed by a recommendation algorithm that combines your health and context data with research, cohort and health consultant data. The impact of the recommendation algorithm can be leveraged further by any data about you and your environment. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>As a team of five developers we split work into three main areas: <strong>Backend</strong>, <strong>iOS App &amp; Design</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Backend</h3>\n<p>Our backend team was mainly focused on getting as much information as possible from various data sources (OURA, Isaacus, Kanta, Localtapiola, Tieto &amp; ISS, Apple HealthKit and many more). This information was highly heterogenous, thus we had to clean, restructure and combine it before we could use it in our classification algorithm.</p>\n<p>This algorithm had to be developed as well. It is responsible for detecting the benchmarks for a good health that we could compare the user's data to. The algorithm uses clustering to detect cohorts of similar people.</p>\n<p>To get access to those values, a REST-API was created as well.</p>\n<h3>App</h3>\n<p>Following our idea of simplifying the large amounts of daily health data, our app reduces distraction by using a simplistic design. It lets you concentrate on living a healthy life. All you have to do to live a healthier life is to allow <strong>Ges::ndheit</strong> access to HealthKit and (optionally) Kanta. The app then automatically fetches your data and compares it with other patients\u2019 data in our backend to generate a personalized instruction just for you.</p>\n<p>Performance-wise the whole app is 100% pure Swift in order to run as fast as possible.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were a lot of technical difficulties in making the data look pretty, so it is comparable and clusterable. Mistakes in some datasets (e.g. 500kg+ body weight) made it even more difficult for us, as we had to clean the data using outlier detection.</p>\n<p>Another challenge was that some of the IOT devices we wanted to use were either not provided (e.g. the Nest thermostat) or already taken (e.g. the Amazon Echo). The former could be solved by creating a Nest Thermostat Simulator which is now accessed by our API instead of the real technical device.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team worked very well, as everybody had distinct expertises that combined covered the whole range from Design, over Frontend, Apps, and Backend to Machine Learning.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, the backend team worked hard on the implementation of an algorithm to find groups of user types and to match you in one of those to find reference values. We think that we came up with a very good solution considering the time we could spent on it.</p>\n<p>Finally, we believe that <strong>Ges::ndheit</strong> can have a huge impact on overall global health and could make the world a better place by producing healthier residents.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>If you go to Finland take enough money with you, as beer is really expensive there.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ges::ndheit</h2>\n<p><strong>Ges::ndheit</strong> made us realize that there is a lot of <strong>.space</strong> for improvements in current HealthTech applications and services. As it is open source, we hope that it can help to inspire other developers to improve current health and fitness applications to be more personalized and thus more valuable to its users.</p>\n<h2>Radix</h2>\n<p>Hey Radix guys, our URL is: <a href=\"http://gesundheit.space\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://gesundheit.space</a> :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"

my university everyone (honestly, everyone) hates the cafeteria. The food is really bad there. And in our building we have around 50 vending machines which sell coffee and non-perishable goods as chocolates, sweets and fizzy water. There is no \u201creal\u201d food inside vending machines because it is too risky for entrepreneurs to place them because if they won\u2019t sell sandwich or salad in two days they will become wasted and entrepreneur will lose money.</p>\n<p>On the work the problem is even worse. There is no cheap cafeteria inside our business center and we are forced to either bring food from home or to order a delivery from restaurants which also costs a lot, takes time and because of the traffic you can never rely on it - courier can get 2-3 hours late.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Boxy is an app connected to our own chain of lockers which allows you to get things you need at the most convenient spots. While parcel lockers are made mostly for e-commerce delivery of inedible goods we want to target consumable goods as the food industry where we can replace vending machines and delivery services. We will offer our users a limited choice so it will be easy and fast to choose.</p>\n<p>Boxy is the infrastructure for making orders to Boxy lockers. Located in transport hubs, business centers, facilities Boxy gives you a possibility to pre-order a food for a day (breakfast, lunch or dinner) or for a subsription plan (Diet or weight gain program, for example) and choose from the variety of meals on every taste. Imagine, for the whole office lunch there is only one delivery and there are no leftovers. </p>\n<p>In some offices there are vending machines with perishable goods as sandwiches and even hot meals. But entrepreneurs in order to survive the huge amount of leftovers have to increase prices. In Boxy there is no risk of leftovers, so the prices will be as affordable as possible.</p>\n<p>In future, many services can be sold inside Boxy app marketplace. 5 years ago everyone was doing Uber for something. Now there is a time to do Boxy for something and make savings because of one-time delivery instead of numerous deliveries in one-demand services as Uber or Gett.</p>\n<p>We want to grow virally on the start by spreading new food culture around office workers. Afterwards we plan to build a marketplace for our partners inside our app or open an API to other startups. There can be Boxy for groceries, Boxy for pets food, Boxy for flowers, etc. </p>\n<p><strong>Our big goal</strong> is to change customers' lifestyle - make durable goods purchase <strong>cheaper</strong> and <strong>easier</strong> than today. Your cell at Boxy machine will <strong>unite</strong> few daily purchases from different patners marketplaces <strong>into one</strong> via our ecosystem, which includes mobile app and web-site. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We collected ideas for our concept for more than a year, because we have developed delivery service for a healthy food in Moscow. Investors of that project wanted to make a classical on-demand app (as many in food delivery market) so we could not develop and test interesting mechanics for customers. We couldn't make food purchase faster or improve service UX. Obviously, our project had no competitive advantages and we failed. Mostly, because our partners had lack of knowledge about IT projects management. So we started to find ways to make delivery system cheaper and more convenient for customers .</p>\n<p>We prepared concept and main ideas of our project in Moscow. Also, we made a machine scheme and bought some of hardware parts for it - raspberry pi, breadboard, connectors, etc. We discussed database scheme at the back-end and main methods, which helped us to manage purchases and locker's management. </p>\n<p>At the Junction we worked cohesively and managed to achieve almost every goal for the development that we have set before the hackathon. We made the whole Boxy system prototype, including iOS app MVP, which works well for product purchase and interactions with lockers. Our cardboard locker has two boxes with locks and Arduino + Raspberry Pi pair for lock management by numerical code and mobile app:</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>To create a combination of software and hardware and manage everything to work together.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>In 2 days we've made a mobile iOS client, server app, all the hardware and the website with small project description (<a href=\"http://www.boxy.store\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.boxy.store</a>). We solved a lot of different software and hardware troubles together. Few times we reworked our plan and added or edited features of the project.</p>\n<p>We prepared a development plan for Boxy and understood how to expand fastly. Also, we chose the franchisee/partner model for a fast growth of number of Boxy machines in which franchisee pays for the automat and gets access to a huge Boxy ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Starting costs for franchisee will be relatively low and business will be almost automized so it will become a really attractive passive investment for entrepreneurs. We want to increase payments to franchisees at return of investments stage to boost machines quantity. After returning investments, we will decrease franchisee's revenue percent and they may invest the return in new machines.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Zalando box is a perfect place to hide all the hardware :)\n<img alt=\"Alt text\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/FIPDm1F.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--auAHuKjx--/http://i.imgur.com/FIPDm1F.jpg\"/>\nAnd cardboard box from Junction can actualy become the replacement of parcel locker :)\n<img alt=\"Alt text\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/DDgSUrX.jpg.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--6MLl15uv--/http://i.imgur.com/DDgSUrX.jpg.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>Your lunch is ready :)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Boxy</h2>\n<p>No matter how the hackathon will end we will continue to develop the product and we're sure about its bright and interesting future. We have strategies to develop and launch our project in Russia.</p>\n<p>Also, we are glad to get feedback and new use cases of Boxy from partners and participants of Junction. We will rework some system mechanics and find problems, which we can solve in particular in Finland and Europe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/estimote\">estimote</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree\">braintree</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/paypal\">paypal</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple-pay</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/box\">box</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">locker</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Business model, idea, logo and presentation.

The only thing I changed about borrowing and lending is <strong>everything</strong>. It gives you two option, create a borrower or investor. Investors can directly register and go to a page where they can see offers and invest on them. Borrower needs to add a bit more information so we can validate them by using their picture and ID and then allowing them to start borrowing. Money is moved directly from the lender to receiver, Money Match just keeps track and connects them together. If there is a agreement on investment, investor receives information about borrower so then can keep in touch regarding money, it's more open in terms of borrowing and lending.

The design is inspired by the Finnish landscape of lush forests and the increasing importance of sustainable consumption.</p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>H\u00fcbs are new age service points for urban commuters. It provides personalized travel and leisure information to the users in an intuitive interface. It also makes sure that the commuters feel comfortable while waiting for the transportation. The curved touch screen display utilizes the optimal space to provide the best possible experience for the user. The sensors (weather, proximity) placed will enable the H\u00fcb to protect the commuters from poor weather conditions. The roof will automatically extend when the weather sensors detect rain or snow. The roof is intelligent enough to extend automatically and cover more people if needed.The retractable seating system optimises space usage, also allowing the passengers to use seats as desks. The H\u00fcbs are self-sustainable with solar power and allow commuters to charge their electronic devices (possibly not feasible during the winter). In addition, the plant communicates sustainability. </p>\n<p>The digital touch screen interface also promotes social interaction as users in different H\u00fcb locations are able to see and communicate with each other. The interface will also give users recommendations based on ongoing events, location, and real time weather forecasts. The integration of HSL route planning system ensures that commuters don\u2019t get lost. The personalization aspect of H\u00fcb enable external advertising partners to customize adverts according to the user preference and interests.</p>\n<h2>How we built it:</h2>\n<p>As our team did not consist of any developers, we relied strongly on our product and service design abilities. Approaching the problems from a user perspective enabled us to develop a futuristic bus stop that provides practical benefits. We started the design process by identifying all the possible challenges that a person may face at a typical Finnish bus stop. We categorized all those challenges into different areas and identified the touch points. We also listed out all the associated stakeholders in order to have a different perspective to the problem in hand. As the next step, we defined the problem statement and brainstormed solutions to tackle it. We shortlisted, combined ideas and generated the final concept. Drawings and journey maps of the final concept were made before 3D modeling the H\u00fcb and prototyping the digital user interface. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into:</h2>\n<p>Finding a coder/ developer.\nSelecting a track based on our skills and interests.\nFinding a place to work.\nThe main challenge was to decide how to showcase our concept without a coded, working prototype.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of:</h2>\n<p>Designing a practical, ergonomic and beautiful bus stop. \n3D model of the H\u00fcb.\nUI of the digital touch screen display (we didn\u2019t have a coder!)</p>\n<h2>What we learned:</h2>\n<p>How a Hackathon is like!\nHow to hack without coding!</p>\n<h2>What's next for H\u00fcb:</h2>\n<p>We are gonna wait for the geeks to implement our awesome concept :-P</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://invis.io/TS9HRE1A9#/208171361_1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://invis.io/TS9HRE1A9#/208171361_1\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>invis.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Grebz", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Grebz \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/175/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It's our first hackathon and we really like this coffee cup.

I also thought about using the Embers sensor data in conjunction with some kind of machine learning, but decided I wouldn't have time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It was intended to capture tweets from a given geographic area based on a location that the user input, and from that find tweets that expressed an opinion on that area, or areas WITHIN that area, generating a report on the fly as more tweets stream in. However, due to various technical and time issues, I  adapted it so that it printed noun phrases from tweets that merely had a location present within them.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Tweepy in order to handle interactions with the Twitter API, which let me easily get the Twitter stream and filter it to the geographic location that was determined by running the user-inputted location through a geolocation service. I began using NLTK in order to perform basic NLP on the captured tweets, running a text chunker in order to find noun phrases, and further reducing those down by something I'll describe in the next section..,</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>My Chromebook didn't have the power necessary to run more complex NLP operations such as dependency parsing, which forced me to try and use external systems like AWS. However, this did not end up working out. Due to this, I was reduced to only using text chunking in order to find a location. To do that, I hacked together some code that would take a noun phrase (if found in the sentence it was looking at), and run each word through the geolocation API I was using. If they did not return None, the noun phrase containing them was added to the report (as they could be assumed to be a location of some kind). This is buggy as hell and not my original goal, but it was just about as close as I could get in order to be able to demo SOMETHING.</p>\n<p>I also dealt with some lack of documentation on Tweepy's end, most notably the order of latitude and longitude points for the bounding box not being specified. That took me a little while to figure out.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to get a stream from any user-inputted location was pretty cool. I won't say I'm proud of the hacked-together location finder though, that'd just be wrong...</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned more about how to interact with Twitter, as well as learning more about NLP techniques from the reading of the NLTK book about the processes.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CityHelper</h2>\n<p>Try and get the natural language side of the program sorted, so it can run as it was intended to with dependency parsing in order to obtain the location more accurately. The rest of the code would more or less fall into place, with perhaps an additional opinion extractor layer to get specific details.

So you decide to go on vacation. You book the train, hotel, arrive there, and then you realize it is not what you envisioned. Then you regret your choice. Why did this happen ? Because the pictures you\u2019ve seen were deceptive. And advice you\u2019ve heard from people with different taste than you. So how do you find the perfect destination without going through a numerous number of pictures and travel websites ? This was my inspiration and this is the problem which lead me to think of this app <strong>TravelSphere</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TravelSphere allows people to check iconic places from all around the world in Virtual Reality, 360 degree Panoramas. Simply saying with TravelSphere you can virtually travel to any place in the world. You can get the immersive feeling of you really being there. After looking at various places in the place where you want to go, you can make more informative decisions on where to travel. Further TravelSphere can be used by people who want to escape reality for may be one hour. With sound effects specific to each iconic place, with special lighting, TravelSphere gives users a unique, one of a kind experience. Not only the iconic places, travelsphere suggest you places to stay, bars, pubs around the area where you want to travel so that you know where to go and what to do before you even go there.</p>\n<p>Content providers can register at _ <a href=\"http://www.travelsphere.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.travelsphere.tech</a> _ and submit their 360 degree panorama content to travelsphere and get paid. On the other hand, advertisers can advertise their places (hotels, clubs, pubs around iconic places) inside TravelSphere. This business model makes TravelSphere easily expandable. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The mobile application for Android was built with Google VR Unity SDK. \nThe web application is hosted in Microsoft Azure and Image processing of photospheres too is done in the Azure cloud. This unique algorithm runs in the back-end when an advertiser or a content provider uploads an Photosphere to the TravelSphere system through the web application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I am a one man team and I had to take care of everything from creating icons and logos in Photoshop to developing the mobile app to creating the web app and finally writing the Image processing application as well. Hardships are numerous and currently I am in the process of trying to run Image processing in the cloud in Azure. Right now it is done locally. Have been stuck for a while here but let's see how it would go. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am really proud that I was able to create the working prototype within this limited amount of time working alone. I am really proud of what I have created and I hope I would be able finish it off in style.  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Learnt a lot about Microsoft Azure. I am a new bee to Azure and thanks to the free Azure credits I got, I was able to explore the possibilities of using a powerful service like Azure. Further had to learn a lot about the framework I used to do the Image processing (EMGU CV). Though the processing part seemed obvious up front, had a go through a hardtime when doing it learning function by function step by step in the EMGUCV library. \nThough I have created apps for Oculus Rift, this is my first time wih Google VR SDK. Hence learnt a lot about how to handle it as well. Performance enhancing of VR apps is another thing I learnt while working on this project. </p>\n<h2>What's next for TravelSphere</h2>\n<p>TravelSphere is not just an app but a platform with a feasible business model. With business all around the globe coming into play, TravelSphere could revolutionize the way people Travel and plan trips. Further it could boost businesses all around the world with it's location based targeted advertising features.

We want to motivate people to keep good shape.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>First, you choose how many minutes you want to run today. Then you choose how much money you want to \"invest\" in this running.</p>\n<p>The money is locked in a smart contract on Ethereum's blockchain. </p>\n<p>The code of the contract will give you the money back <em>only</em> if you run the amount of minutes you promised to! If you did - congratulations! You get the money back. If you did only 80%? You get 80% back. The rest is sent, automatically, as a donation to charity.</p>\n<p>To keep track of how much you run, we used a Pebble smartwatch.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The project has three parts: pebble, blockchain and a mobile website that connects them all and gives interface.</p>\n<p>The Pebble is programmed in C language. We used CloudPebble to do that. It communicates with the phone using a node.js server.</p>\n<p>The phone lets the user choose the amount of running time and money to invest in it. We built it with proto.io and bootstrap frameworks. It then use web3.js to transfer this information to Ethereum's blockchain.</p>\n<p>We wrote a smart contract to the blockchain using Solidity language. It first gets the conditions from the phone and locks the money. Once it gets information from Pebble on how much running you actually did, it either sends you the whole amount back, or pass some of it to charity.</p>\n<p>This smart contract, as all blockchain code, is immutable, and cannot be cheated.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Pebble programming, as in any embedding device, is very technical. It lets you use only low level computer languages, such as C, and even then you are limited to which libraries you may utilize.</p>\n<p>Ethereum's blockchain is a new technology still in development state. It is not meant to run on mobile phones, and certainly not in embedded devices such as Pebble. We had to do quite a hack to get around that.</p>\n<p>Making all the components speak to each other was also a huge challenge, as it is not a standard thing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Writing a watchapp for Pebble. Communicating from the mobile with the blockchain, and in general, making those three devices work together.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about working together. </p>\n<p>We also learned about programming in C, which is becoming less and less common in the current \"scripting\" culture.</p>\n<p>We learned why blockchain apps are not common yet, and how difficult it is to actually make a safe one. We discovered that it is hard to make different devices \"speak\" to one another.</p>\n<h2>What's next for FitBlitz</h2>\n<p>As a next step it would be interested to make this a \"multi-player\" challange, where the money of the \"loser\"s (who didn't run enough) go to the \"winners\" (who run too much). </p>\n<p>This would be like betting on how much sports you would do, and may be the first positive usage of betting in the history.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solidity</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ethereum</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/proto-io\">proto.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">web3</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/eyalron33/fitblitz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/eyalron33/fitblitz\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I coded the Ethereum smart contract using the Solidity-language.

We thought that it was an interesting concept and wanted to implement something for it. In addition to this we walked around the venue at Junction and found the GE energy challenge. This challenge was meant to get people aware of how their energy is produced. We saw that there is a good opportunity in combining these, thus How am I powered? was born.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is an app that shows information about from where energy comes in Finland. In addition to this it integrates with Paulig Muki coffee cup and pushes the information to it also.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Based on Paulig\u2019s example app we continued to implement our own functionality. We mainly used Android Studio for development.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>None of us had done mobile app development before. This meant that there were many new things to take into consideration even though it is a really small app. Another challenge is that the cup is powered by heat difference, so you had to swap cold and hot water in it to get it working.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We actually got something to show up on the mug</li>\n<li>We made a functioning Android application with no previous experience </li>\n<li>Having great fun at Junction!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>That even though you have no experience in a field doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t get things done. We learned that we can quickly adapt and get something done.</p>\n<h2>What's next for How am I powered?</h2>\n<p>The next steps in developing the app would be better integration with APIs from Finnish power suppliers and the existing Paulig Muki app. Energy consumption and production statistics could be shown on bigger e-paper display in every house. In addition to this the data could be sent over something else than your phone, for example a micro controller.

A person is asked to specifically NOT to touch the button, so when he does, we show a broken screen image. Meanwhile, the webcam feed is analyzed and recognized facial emotions are saved into the database.\nAfter that, a company or a person who bought the advertisement space would be able to see the general feedback and potentially conduct real life A/B advertisements tests.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>First we created a webpage displaying some material for presentation purposes, then used clmtrackr js to read the facial expression of the person interacting with it. We are gathering data in MySQL using custom made PHP restful API framework. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge was thinking of what to develop. First ideas were about gamification of fashion advertising, but they would require very high quality tracking and more than just one static webcam. Going from there, we've decided to use a simpler form of computer vision, just recognition.\nAnother (unsolved) is stable facial emotion recognition. A huge number of researchers work on the solution, and right now we use one of the open source implementations. In the future, it will get better.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that the idea at the end turned out OK.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The bus stop screen is just a big monitor in a public space.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Make people sarcastic again</h2>\n<p>The next crazy hackathon.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitbucket\">bitbucket</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">radix</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://sarcasticpeople.website/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sarcasticpeople.website/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sarcasticpeople.website</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sarcasticpeople.website/statistic/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://sarcasticpeople.website/statistic/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sarcasticpeople.website</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I made some front-end parts.", "Hacking", ""]], ["AHA", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AHA \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/061/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>UI</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Illness and medical treatment is very hard for all stakeholders.\nImagine a child enjoying his time at the hospital and how that would help the parents and the staff.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Aha! helps with the communication between the parents, children and the the hospital staff, by providing a novel interactive picture based interface, which works as a daily schedule for the patient and staff. </p>\n<p>The family can see upcoming events, understand the overall treatment process clearly and communicate it to the small patient, with the help of the pictures.

What if that time could be used to learn more about activities that suit your current mood and are organized nearby you? Esa Bus Stop recognizes your feelings and provides you with empathic recommendations and advertisement that truly interest you at the given moment. Since the system is enabled by machine learning, it will learn more about the citizens and their needs as time goes by. Thus, the stop offers a great opportunity for advertisers to keep learning about their audience and their reactions as well as use the collected data to constantly enhance future marketing efforts. With this technology advertisers could display higher amount of targeted advertisements and therefor increase marketing income.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The team wanted to do something fun and learn in the process. The utilized technologies were not those we use in our daily lives since we just wanted to try out something new while having the chance.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The bus stop analyzes the user by it's sensors and displays targeted advertisements and other content depending on users's emotions, sex, age, time and whether user is going home or not.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Esa-bustop is based on Microsoft Cognitive Services. It has neural networks which are taught to recognise people by their looks and give them recommendations by their mood. For example that 25 year old happy looking woman might want to try Yoga class this evening. We use bus stop cameras to take pictures of by passers, and send those pictures for analysis. Once analysed, screen shows best fit recommendations for that person.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Figuring out what kind of content to show users in a different kinds of emotional states. A technical challenge we encountered was teaching the neuron network well enough in just 48 hours.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to deliver an MVP of an awesome service that we believe will add real value to both costumers and advertisers. However the solution can be enhanced with very potential features in the future. We also gained a lot of new knowledge from different technologies and from each other.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned loads about  basics of machine learning, and we\u2019ve also played with different kinds of new (or for some of us new) technologies such as Microsoft Cognitive Services and Azure that taught us a lot. We didn\u2019t know all the team members beforehand, and since coming from very different disciplines, we were able to teach each other a lot from service &amp; UX design and front &amp; back-end development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Esa Bus Stop</h2>\n<p>Making multiple interactive bus stops around the city which allows user tracking around the city with face recognition. After showing content to user neural network would track user's reactions on the content and make future content more targeted for the user. Also speech and gesture interactions with bus stop would be possible. This is how we could gather enough data about user's travel habits, emotions, places where he is going, what time and so on. Eventually bus stops could show highly targeted content based on gathered information. The data could also be utilized for city development purposes and to provide those kind of services and events to citizens that suit their feelings and needs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neural-network</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cycle.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">signalr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/harjuto/sad-esa.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/harjuto/sad-esa.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Resuscitation", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Resuscitation \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/013/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>During heartbeat</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Resuscitation \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/014/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Inspiration was the theme of the game jam \"resurrection\" and Rammstein's Spieluhr.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You move a cube inside a heart while only seeing the platforms every heartbeat.

We saw multiple opportunities how to utilize thermal cameras capabilities to detect human presence. First priority was, of course, to solve problems with processing the raw sensor data and utilize machine vision techniques to detect people in thermal image to, for example, count them. Helvar utilizes this system in active lightning control to predict people movement in offices and corridors and turn on only required lights with added option of light intensity control. Secondly, we saw possibility to use same sensor to count people in robot bus, in Helsinki, while still maintaining privacy of passengers. Third challenge is from GE whereby we tried to count people and estimate the heat emitted from their bodies. Using this data we could optimize the central heating system to use less heat and hence save energy and money. We felt that all three problems can be approached by a common solution/method. And this is the use of thermal imaging and then using the acquired data to move towards solution to above mentioned challenges. There are no privacy concerns. The solution are generally cheap to deploy and the prospects are HUGE!</p>\n<h2>What it does?</h2>\n<p>The FLIR Lepton thermal camera is relatively cheap piece of hardware, opening new opportunities to sense presence of people. It was provided by Helvar with required openCV and python software on raspberry pi 3 development board. Code was written to detect the number of people by keeping in view the limited resolution of the camera. After detecting the number of people and the amount of heat radiated by them, we can use this data for all the above mentioned challenges. </p>\n<h2>How we built it?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Sending picture stream from camera to server that is doing the actual machine vision.</li>\n<li>Detection of the contours, using existing algorithms from openCV (this give us the number of people).</li>\n<li>Detection of entrance/exit of the thermal image (real time tracking of people number).</li>\n<li>Creating ID for each contour inside the image. </li>\n<li>Designed 3D printable device enclosure, inspired by junction logo.</li>\n<li><p>This data could be used to save power as per power emitted by human body.

For example hot coffee mug caused automatic gain control to render human body temperature same color as surrounding structures i.e. whole image saturation. Hardware was otherwise quite straight forward. Programming, however, caused quite a few problems due to installation of the programs and finding correct tools with preferred language, we were supposed to use existing tools, not to create anything new due to short time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Although we did not quite reach goal, we went according to the plan and got done everything we tried. The system has been implemented in a basic form. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Thermal cameras are getting more advanced year by year but are not quite there yet. Lepton is interesting project but does not yet work with intended usages, mostly due to resolution and narrow field of view. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Meltdown</h2>\n<p>Core of the team will continue working as a team due to same working place, we will wait for future hackathons and perhaps continue working with new stuff. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lepton</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">thermal-camera</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printer</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Working with mathematics.", "", "", ""]], ["DELETED", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We thought about inefficient ways of using meeting rooms and wanted to change it. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using personal preferences of each worker invited to meeting we use special algorithm to find best possible meeting place</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using html, SQL and some python</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how teamwork is important, also we learned basic SQL, json</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project One</h2>\n<p>Development after hackathon, if judges will like it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["InstaMuki", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tP4yDuilwMw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"InstaMuki \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/450/308/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Loading post from Instagram</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We inspired by idea to display any image on the Muki cup. Owner of the cup shouldn't do anything to charge device, just to fill it with a hot drink! Our main idea is to display fresh news on the cup's display especially in the morning just after waking up. As far as Muki cup has low-resolution e-Ink and small display we decided that the best way to show fresh news will be posts from Instagram social network which are emphasis on images.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We made an Android application that establishes pairing with Muki cup and performs authorization in the Instagram. After that each time our application launches it fetches yours friends posts from Instagram, choose the freshest one and transfer it to the cup along with the post' owner info.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We have create an Android project based on a Muki api sample and investigated how image transfer works. Then we embedded an integration with Instagram via fetching the most recently uploaded image from owner friends list. Also it was too inconvenient to connect to Muki device each time when we want to transfer image, cause it required a cup id. That's why we decided to add a QR-code scanner for simplification. Also a settings screen purposed to store cup id and Instagram authorization token was added.\nWe made an accent that Muki cup owner shouldn't do anything in Instagram (likes any photos, mark them by hashtag or etc.) except of authorization once. All job will be held by updates of users he is following. And possible that those ppl wouldn't be guess that their post can be shown on the new generation cup! </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Nobody of our team uses Instagram API before. It was a challenge to receive the most recently uploaded image from user's friends list because of Instagram hasn't direct endpoint for this purpose.\nWe made a goal that Muki cup owner shouldn't do anything in Instagram (likes any photos, mark them by hashtag or etc.) except of authorization once. All job should be held by updates of users he is following. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We enforce this great device to <strong>work</strong>! :-) Really, bluetooth-pairing <strong>very</strong>, <strong>very</strong> unstable and not every device was able to keep connection. The work was slow cause a cup has a power from hot water. Each time the temperature slows down the work stops until refreshing cup with a hot water again. We are proud that accomplished our application with working features less than in 1 weekend.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Instagram API, Muki API, how to charge and refresh Muki cup device and a headache of bluetooth pairing :-) How to embed a QR scanner and collaborate with team members</p>\n<h2>What's next for InstaMuki</h2>\n<p>We want to add push notification to automatically upload images from Instagram directly to the Muki cup without owner interaction. We hope people will be happy to see real-time images from their follow list at the morning while fill cup with a hot coffee.\nAlso if we win, we will submit our Instagram client for review by one's team (for now it works in sandbox mode)\nWe are expected the next generation of Muki cup that will have higher resolution enough to display more complex text post or bundle of tweets</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/instagram\">instagram</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">qr-code-scanner</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gson\">gson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">okhttp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/bavin/junction\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/bavin/junction\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I've embedded Instagram API to the application that fetches recently uploaded photo to device", "", ""]], ["Magnets?", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>-Many game developers such as Rovio seeks additional sales from toys.

We downloaded a magnetic field detector to iPhone and witnessed how the Phone reacts to magnets. </p>\n<p>3) First prototype</p>\n<p>With a couple lines of code, we were able to move a tiny object on the screen with a magnet.</p>\n<p>4) Minimum viable product (first game)</p>\n<p>After a long night and some desperate moments the first game (pong) was born. </p>\n<p>5) Second game</p>\n<p>We implemented the controller into another game that we designed and made the controller work more reliably.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>After the first prototype we begun to seek how to magnetometer responses to object\u2019s location. After all, we had to dig pretty deep into mathematics to make the algorithm work reliable in all three different sectors. It took several cups of coffee and many f*uck words, but finally we managed to get it rock.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Firstly, we are proud how we accomplished to make a fairly well working game controller in just a short time. Secondly, we proved that it is pretty easy to implement  the technology into other existing games.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our biggest learning experience was how we can combine different technologies and our personal expertise from different fields. On top of that, we found out that you can get an overdose of caffeine. </p>\n<h2>What's next for MagControl</h2>\n<p>We will continue the software and business development next week. After some necessary improvements we will approach game developers and toy companies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/qrmt/MagneticPong\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/qrmt/MagneticPong\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/qrmt/MagnetLibrary\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/qrmt/MagnetLibrary\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rauroll/coffee-sloth-ios/tree/magnet-controller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rauroll/coffee-sloth-ios/tree/magnet-controller\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Master of magnets", "", "", ""]], ["4D visualization in VR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The 4D world is hard to be understood by our brains, but VR make it possible to peek from different directions in 3D in more natural way.

However, we already have some negative feelings when we are waiting too long at bus stops. Our ambition is making bus stops more friendly, to make it human-centric service.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The system includes a web camera, a big display, and a web server. The camera on the display can capture the faces of passengers at bus stops and the system can recognize their emotions. Based on detected emotions, the system can optimize advertisements on the display.</p></li>\n<li><p>For example, when a passenger is waiting for a bus on a dark and cold night, he/she would have negative emotions such as anger, fear and loneliness. At that time, the system can detect his/her negative emotions and display a fire place that will relax him/her. Once he/she has positive emotions, the following advertisement can be much more effective for branding. Moreover, the data of passengers' emotions can improve the quality of advertisements.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Our framework includes three main components: a webcam, a local website, and the Google Cloud Vision API. Every second one image is captured from the webcam and is sent to Google Cloud Vision API using Python. This API returns the number of faces and their emotions to the bus stop (a website developed with Javascript and vue.js).</p></li>\n<li><p>These emotions include: joy, sorrow, surprise and anger. The advertisement will be showed based on how majority of the passengers feel. Furthermore, the number of people and their feeling are showed in the monitor through emoji icons. The system automatically shuts down after 10 second if no one is at the bus stop to save energy. </p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, all data about persons emotions  will be recorded to further purpose, for example to analyse how people react to advertisements.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p>First, it cost us three hours to use the GoPro camera for capturing images. The main problems we had was connecting via wifi, controlling the device and saving the high quality image. However, we gave up on this device because we can only connect to one wifi network at the same time and we also need to use Internet connection to call the cloud servicess.</p></li>\n<li><p>Secondly, The quality of the webcam imageswas not good enough (low resolution and small image size). Also, the webcam is placed at top of the bus stop and it's not an ideal viewpoint for face recognition system. Our initial API from Microsoft Cognitive Services easily failed and didn't detect any faces.</p></li>\n<li><p>Thirdly, we got really hungry in the middle night and could not focus to do more coding.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of the broad effects of this system. The system has the merits for three stakeholders, including passengers, JCDecaux, and Advertisers (clients of JCDecaux). For passengers, the system can make them feel relaxed, thanks to optimised contents. For JCDecaux, they can maximise the effect of advertisements and get valuable user data. For Advertisers, the system can contribute to establish strong brands.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the importance of teamwork. At first, we had difficulty of communicating with each other because all of us have different backgrounds. After we identified the purpose of this system and divided our roles, it became much easier to communicate.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HappyBusStop</h2>\n<p>In the near future, bus stops would become half public and half private space, thanks to the personal mobility technology. The next step of HappyBusStop might be how to create the personalised spaces.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vue.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webcam</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vis.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I mainly created the contents, including visual materials and business value propositions.", "I created the bus stop front-end & glued lots of stuff together", "Did the visualization and some work on the interface to the camera", "I contribute my experience in computer vision and image processing, also machine learning.

When we started to look into it, it turned out that it's quite complicated to provide ultimate service which can be integrated with many different POS systems and it's quite hard to persuade the merchants that there will be 1 unique card which will identify all the customers and they have to integrate in 1 common system. We understood that if we would try to integrate will all the existing POS systems it would be almost impossible and it would take a lot of time to do that. So we had to come up with solution that does fix this main '1 card' problem and does it simple and universal way so that most of the merchant could implement that quick, simple and with affordable cost. We had to hack the POS systems externally :)</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This Plug&amp;Play extension kit solution adds additional functionality to existing the POS systems by just plugging it into the POS and doing few minor configurations in Fidebox web based administration panel.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It does allow to accept any NFC tag as a loyalty card right away. Customers can use any in their wallet existing contactless (NFC) card to register &amp; identify themselves (or get custom ordered merchant's NFC tag/card if they haven't got any in their wallet). It does ease customer onboarding process in loyalty program and does easy the everyday identification.</li>\n<li>It does help for merchant to be able to set up a rules for dynamic loyalty programs (For example, give X% discount to specific happy hours to my customers, give x% discount to customers who have visited at least y times, every 10th time when you visit store you get additional x% discount) These rules can be setup outside the POS system so there is no need for POS upgrade and/or programming. These kind of programs can additionaly motivate customers to visit merchant more frequently and increase loyalty as customers who do visit more offten get more discounts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We had a short interview with each of the team members and we have an answers:\nGuntis: \"We spent more than 8h to disscuss all the functionality needed to be able to plug-in and configure this solution without any programming, be able to connect it to the most of the POS systems and to come up with the right name for it. Fidebox is made from 'Fide' - which means 'loyalty/ trust' in Latin + box because it's physyical box which does the magic. We used Raspberry Pi as a controller which does connect and communicate with POS system, it does read the NFC tags, using ACR122 NFC reader and communicates with Fidebox online service. Then there is a Administration panel built on AngularJS &amp; bootstrap and many others things. Last but nost least we are using Walmoo API which is customer loyalty &amp; identification platform and does provide many functionalities and logic that we needed to be able to build Fidebox solution so quickly and legit.\"\nOskars: \"With dedication and a lot of arguing.\"\nKarina: \"No comments\"\nKristaps: \"We took existing hardware, empowered with our custom software solution to make it all work!\"\nKriss: \"We just did it!\"</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Guntis: Coming up with the title, one sentence description and product pitch.\nOskars: \"Make it on time to the ferry.\"\nKarina: \"No comments\"\nKristaps: \"Deciding on which energy drink to drink first.\"\nKriss: \"Integration with realy cool 21st century api - walmoo\"</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Guntis: \"Built great concept around the initial idea.

After shipment has arrived it can be transported back immediately by just dropping the empty plastic folder into the post box as it contains necessary delivery information to be returned back to sender. </p>\n<p>We developed an End-user PHP web app utilizing IBM Bluemix with delivery information that is available for UPM workers and customers to view the current status and real-time location of the orders. </p>\n<p>In a bigger shell:\nThe service includes:</p>\n<p>1). Tracking - device installed in the delivery notes folder\nDuring the hackathon we prototyped it with DragonBoard and cell phone to test and printed the plastic mold of the folder with 3D printer available on-site by Shaperize - we took into account the dimension of the tracker we would build in real life.\nWe have calculated the costs on a very detailed level and made a hardware and manufacturing costs/proposal for building a tracker.</p>\n<p>2). Tracking visualisation - web application that displays shipments in progress with information about possible delays and early arrivals. That is done by comparing actual location of the tracker with the scheduled arrival time (which is the estimate given by shipping company). \nWe have built a prototype with the web app that is updated real time, which has: Step 1 (overview of shipments in progress - a mock up), Step 2 (delivery status of the specific shipment - aka tracker info; with travel history and current location), Step 3 (analytics dashboard displaying the information on the customer claims and their history - to see if the tracker had any impact on those or not; we built the dashboard with IBM Watson; dashboard can be used by both UPM workers and with limited view by customers).</p>\n<p>PS. We actually made quite precise calculations and proved that our service is viable and makes real business sense. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We configured the DragonBoard to send GPS coordinates and timestamp to IBM Bluemix and Watson Analytics. Later we used one of our Android phones to send realtime GPS coordinates with MQTT to IBM Bluemix as we walked around the facility to submit new unique data. Then the information is processed in the cloud and visualised to better represent the current situation of deliveries with our PHP website. The PHP website is hosted on IBM Bluemix as well as implementing Google Maps to represent the various deliveries and their locations. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Configuration of the DragonBoard with Linux installed to access the GPS sensor built in. Displaying realtime location in the browser.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Lot's of new stuff starting from DragonBoard configs and ending with specifics of logistics in the forestry domain. PHP web development and integrating MQTT message payloads to extract GPS coordinates.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MISTY</h2>\n<p>We should develop our prototype further and work on the features! And of course - production!</p>\n<h2>More in Google Drive</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1rJuQkIQKTmUXlhWUVqWnBjUTA\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1rJuQkIQKTmUXlhWUVqWnBjUTA</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dragonboard</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mistlocation.mybluemix.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mistlocation.mybluemix.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mistlocation.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lehtomar/mistlocation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lehtomar/mistlocation\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the web app prototype (css, html), planning of the idea feasibility, final promo materials, including presentation and its design and a bit of everything otherwise.", "Business intelligence, cost and profit calculations, innovation, graphical design", "", "", ""]], ["Bondi", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bondi \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/449/944/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Bondi MainView</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bondi \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/449/946/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Premilinary user journey mapping</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bondi \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/449/947/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Usercase descriptions for programmers.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We wanted to contribute to the benefit of our World in time when climate change and one of its root causes, personal traffic, have become evidently life threatening. Our vision was to bring back the freedom that busses used to have and combine it with the timeliness that subways have. After all, why can't a bus stop at other places than at a bus stop, and do you ever even check out the subway schedules when they come every two minutes anyway? In *lunfardo (the slang of Buenos Aires), \"bondi\" means \"city bus\" which can basically stop anywhere (but does have those traditional bus stops as well) and that was our inspiration.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, we created Bondi, a solution that finds you the fastest robot bus route with no need to look at schedules or to walk to a certain bus stop. Simply leave when you\u2019re ready and walk to the route the bus goes. The bus will know that you're in need of it and that you're nearby its route so it will stop when by your side. It will automatically track your travel with location data and this way optimize the capacity for each robot bus.</p>\n<p>We started this project by outlining the current challenges and pinpointing how we solve these. We're especially proud of the easy-to-use UI with intuitive swipe that lets you either point your destination in a map view or by typing the final address in the other view.</p>\n<p>Bondi is the easiest way to find and get on the bus to travel to your destination in the fastest way without the usual hassle of schedules, finding and walking to a certain bus stop or wondering when to get off.</p>\n<p>What's next for Bondi is highly dependent on the development of Sohjoa robot busses in Helsinki. With increased amount of robot busses, Bondi could well replace the traditional Reittiopas website. Passengers of tomorrow don't need to schedule their departure because robot busses go so often. And passengers of tomorrow don't need to walk far to a certain bus stop because robot busses can stop at any point in their route, greatly facilitating everyone's life.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bondi.surge.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bondi.surge.sh\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bondi.surge.sh</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hannujaakkola/bondi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hannujaakkola/bondi\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["UI/UX/Graphic Designer", "Front-end developement", ""]], ["UPMxBlockchain", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UPMxBlockchain \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/064/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"UPMxBlockchain \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/065/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>All the use of paper and fixed EDI systems in logistics of a supply chain</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Turning interdependent supply chain nodes into an functionally integrated supply chain.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Azure, Ethereum, Front-end stuff, Powerpoint\nWe've set up a private blockchain with multiple nodes.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting the concept across, getting the blockchain working, making it tangible</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Private blockchain working in the Azure cloud, slidedeck</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>TMI</p>\n<h2>What's next for UPMxJunction</h2>\n<p>Small scale pilots</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blockchain\">blockchain</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rupshabagchi/solidityAdventures/blob/master/contracts/UPMsupplychain.sol\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rupshabagchi/solidityAdventures/blob/master/contracts/UPMsupplychain.sol\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["StackTW", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>First, we would like Activities another project but a member of our team in charge of the graphics could not come and we had to urgently look for an idea for a game that we can implement in such a short time the idea of \u200b\u200bthis game is not new but we wanted to implement something similar and create the first game written on their own</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>game to kill some time</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>through pain and tears</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>sleepless nights and a lot of mistakes in the code</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>our first game</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>deeper knowledge of c #

We decided that something should be done to make the relationship between municipality and citizen more active by making use of the technology available.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By making use of city open data, our application allows the municipality have interactive surveys conducted through it's jurisdiction. By using a client application running on iOS phones, municipalities can set up survey questions with a simple yes or no answer. GPS technology incorporated in the phones makes it possible for the questions to be asked on users that are at the moment in close proximity of an issue that needs addressing.\nApplication users have also the possibility to use the application to submit suggestions/complaints regarding the city administration accompanied by photographic feed back taken with their smart phones as well as GPS coordinates.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The client application is build using Swift 3 language and Apple Inc.'s xCode, On the backend we build a rest API using Python with the Flask framework and Node.js . The database is made with MongoDB and contains data taken from the open data api of the city of San Francisco.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge for this project was working with the Swift 3 language, a tool which we were not completely familiar with, and using it to create our client application for the system. When we made the decision to make the client application for iOS devices we took into account multiple factors such as our comfort level in using the technology as well as ease of use. In the end we made an informed decision which favored our solution.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>For this project our biggest satisfaction comes from the fact that our application is a full stack application. We developed a MongoDB with Node.js scripts for data gathering; a python coded api interaction with our server; iOS client applications for end users to have a pleasant experience; web-application coded with angular2 which is used by the service clients to manage their solution.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that simplicity is key, when considering fast initiated projects such as Urbis. For the 48 our development sprint to be successful a crucial aspect for us was to have a clearly defined API and to keep things simple and clean.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Urbis</h2>\n<p>The next step for Urbis would be to finish the iOS client application and expand a bit more the initial functionality. We aimed to fulfill a limited number of our proposed use cases so that progress could be measured properly. </p>\n<p>CREDITS:\nThe logo that we used for this application was <a href=\"http://www.freepik.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Designed by Freepik</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">swift-3.</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docker\">docker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angular2</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.com/urbis/urbis.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gitlab.com/urbis/urbis.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gitlab.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Concept developer\niOS app", "Coded by love", "Development and deployment setup\nBackend work interacting with OpenData APIs", "Back-end\niOS app - bug fixing"]], ["Vooskii", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Chatbots the next APPS?</p>\n<p>Well, Chatbots was the tech trend of 2016, and for sure will be in the next years.

After the jam, we'll probably discuss if we want to do more with this project as a school project or to take this a learning experience and move on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mspaint\">mspaint</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">corel-paint-shop</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">audacity</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4S9BhSUjdmUTVlnMmMzcGZ4Xzg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4S9BhSUjdmUTVlnMmMzcGZ4Xzg\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4S9BhSUjdmUTVlnMmMzcGZ4Xzg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4S9BhSUjdmUTVlnMmMzcGZ4Xzg\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Some sort of a project manager, and a designer.", "Characters, character animation, Game Design", "Decker (Fairlight Excalibur)", ""]], ["Triplanner", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Triplanner \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/826/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>route in Saint Petersburg</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Triplanner \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/859/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>cluster dendrogram</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Triplanner \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/885/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>distance matrix visualization</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Triplanner \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/451/870/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>route in Helsinki</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Do you like travelling as much is we do? If yes, than our inspiration is clear - provide an easy and convinent way to build your holiday plans. Building up your plans can be time consuming and hard, travellers have to do a lot of studing to choose places in big cities. We like to travel and to visit interesting places all over the world. What we want is to help people to travel happilly and without too much preparations, but still get 100% percent of joy and atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Choose a city, a category of interest (museums, religion, etc) and triplanner is ready to roll. It aquires data from different sources (for now that's google maps and wikipedia) and builds a rating of locations. Than they are split into clusters based on distance matrix and the most popular one is chosen. The idea behind it is that the algorithm try to help user to see as much as possible in a shorter amount of time. For example, if user wants to spend one day in a city of choise, the algorithm should lead her to 3-4 most popular places. On the other hand if she wants to spend a week in a city, triplanner can split all locations into 7 clusters so that in each of them all museums are located close to each other. For now we've implemented a very simple prototype, that can build a route for museums for one day.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We've got  this idea a few years ago. At that time we were travelling in Vietnam, and thougt that it would be nice to have an application like this. No need to read wikipedia for a long time, to study public transport routes - just pure fun.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Main challenge for this application is a good rating system. Our idea for this hackathon was to go with google, and get location ratings from maps API. However it looks like google's ratings are not good enough for us, so in future we are going to use more datasources for it: facebook, twitter, foresquare, instagram.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Current application is a basic prototype for web, however it already can build simple routes for one day and one city.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>For the project like this ratings are the main challenge. Using only one source for them is ineffective and sometimes even useless, even if this source is google.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Triplanner</h2>\n<p>Our ideas for future development include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>use more data sources - social networks like facebook, twitter, etc. This way we can build our own rating.</li>\n<li>build route for many days and different categories</li>\n<li>recommend cafes, restoraunts, hotels</li>\n<li>android, ios apps</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitbucket\">bitbucket</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scipy\">scipy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wikipedia\">wikipedia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/mdfyz/junction2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/mdfyz/junction2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]]]
