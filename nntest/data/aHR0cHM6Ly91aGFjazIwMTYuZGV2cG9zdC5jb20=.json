In other words, we want kids to <strong>play</strong> a game and <strong>learn</strong> subjects at the same time.</p>\n<h2>Presenting Quiz Arena</h2>\n<p>Quiz Arena is a game that allows you to go through your study topics all while having fun. Once you select you the topic you would like to study, your academic challenge is manifested into an character that you battle against to pass your test. In order to attack, you have to answer questions in your topic of choice.</p>\n<p>Where do the questions come from? Popular Quizlet flashcard sets, we use the Quizlet API to get a JSON file  with terms and definitions and through a unconventional implementation let our Java program parse it to create a problem set that is included into our game.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We programmed the application in JAVA using the libGDX set of libraries. The JSON parsing was done in native Java.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The art design of the project was a roadblock, we wanted to have a open art style that will appeal to a young audience and also be useful enough to our older users.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>The team is proud of making our very first game together. Our artist was able to create some pretty neat sprite sheets that she can post on her portfolio. Our data miner was able to learn how to get very strange data-types and parse information without the help of GSON.</p>\n<h2>What everybody learned</h2>\n<p>_ Plan ahead. _</p>\n<h2>What's next for Quiz Arena</h2>\n<p>We would love to refine the user experience and add multiplayer support so friends can study together.

The artist often refers to things that bring him his fame and glory as a \"major key.\" Inspired by a need for enhanced security and authentication techniques in our digital world, we created MajorKey to keep your accounts safe from unauthorized users.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MajorKey is a realtime safety net (we call it a \"safe-key\" net) for our accounts. We realize that after a user logs into their account, they are no longer protected - if someone other than you gains access to your account via your password, you are at the mercy of the perpetrator. This solution gives users another chance, and enables the user to consistently verify who they say they are by using keystrone dynamic technologies. Keystroke dynamics refers to the method of identifying or confirming the identity of an individual based on the manner and the rhythm of typing on a keyboard. By streaming this data in real time as the user types, we are able to provide features such as email notifications or account shut-down if the user's typing pattern does not match the pattern stored for the user. A Google Chrome extension allows the user to stream keyboard data from absolutely any source (such as sensitive document editors or online exams)</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built MajorKey using an HTML/CSS and JavaScript front-end based on MaterializeCSS. The front-end communicates with the Java backend via a realtime data streaming service called PubNub.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">domain.com</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://safe-key.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://safe-key.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>safe-key.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed the front-end interface and enabled the PubNub publish/susbcribe while creating the keystroke dynamic data.", "Working backend code dev.

It utilizes a pedometer, as well as the vibration technique and alarm clock in the Pebble watch. The only way you can get this alarm clock to snooze is if you physically get up and take x amount of steps (in this demo it is 10). It's a great way to start the day off right!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Collage Creator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Saw a picture on Instagram and thought about turning all of the users old pictures into a collage of them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Takes a picture of your choice and will then take a hashtag of your choice and turn it into a collage based on RGB percentages</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>With 2 people, teamwork and dedication, coffee helps.

We also used an Intel Edison with a servomotor and servo control board, running Python on Linux Yocto.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had several difficulties integrating OpenCV with Python and in getting the code to recognize that the face in the image was approaching. In addition, we were unable to use the IoT side of the Intel Edison without registering the device on an account since we checked it out from the Hardware Lab, which prevented us from integrating a few features we would have liked to include (a few of them may still be added in the future).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As 75% of the team has never attended a hackathon before, we are extremely proud to have been able to get OpenCV integrated into Python in a functional manner. We are also especially proud to have learned to manipulate the servo after so little time working with Python and the Edison hardware. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to manipulate servos with Python on an Edison board. We also learned to better use the OpenCV image processing library and how to integrate it into Python.</p>\n<h2>What's next for OpenSeeDoors</h2>\n<p>Moving forward, we would like to be able to improve our facial recognition so that the application can be more secure for users and could potentially be implemented for secure access to restricted buildings or homes. We would also like to improve the initial startup time of the program, possibly through storing the generated xml and cascade, as the initial startup/build of the software takes a bit of time. In addition, we would like to connect the hack to the OctoBlue API to potentially integrate text or email notifications of potential improper access attempts.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/servo\">servo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jrach190/uhacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jrach190/uhacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the OpenCV integration with Python, assisted with debugging on the Intel Edison, and worked to develop the overall structure for the project.

It posts an objective like Find el gato. You have to search the image for el gato and click it. It'll tell you if you were wrong or right and then changed the objective.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Through the full 24 hours (much pain, much sadness) we built the code completely in Android Studio. We tried looking through several API's and a few SDK's to get the tools we needed to make our dream a reality because the purpose of the hackathon was to shoot high and learn new things. We learned a ton, it just wasn't how to make a 360 panoramic photo or how to maneuver said photo with position sensors. Ultimately we were unable to utilize any of them and so we then proceeded to use the last 6 hours of our hackathon to hard code the app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Coming in with very little coding experience as a group of mostly aerospace/mechanical engineers we had plenty of challenges. The biggest was finally making the call to stop researching for solutions and change our problem into something do-able. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We pushed code to our phone, made an app, had some clickable buttons. That is pretty cool in our book and we look forward to doing some more android development.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUUUUUUUCH! So much pain for so very little pragmatic knowledge. But Edison first learned 1000 ways to not make a lightbulb. That's what we did, we discovered a 1000 ways to not make the app we wanted. Until we finally made an app worth demoing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Find El Gato</h2>\n<p>We'll decide that after we've slept for at least 8 hours straight.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://uhackelgato.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://uhackelgato.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>uhackelgato.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Warlord5122/Find-el-Gato/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Warlord5122/Find-el-Gato/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped design the game itself and the website.
