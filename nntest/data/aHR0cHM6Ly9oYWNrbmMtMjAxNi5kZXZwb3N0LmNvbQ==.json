Once we had gotten one, we had trouble thinking of what to do with it. We knew we wanted something that could utilize the Leap Motion's unique capability for learning. Ultimately we decided to bring a new way of learning to the classroom using the Leap Motion for modeling chemical structures. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app has two components: a game written in Unity using the Leap Motion, and a website using Heroku. When a student does a task in the game, it submits that data to the server which then updates the website, showing that student's progress in real time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The teacher-facing web page was built on Heroku using Flask and Bootstrap for the front-end. The student-facing component was made using Unity, Leap Motion SDK, and custom-built 3D models.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges was getting data from the Leap Motion game to the web-page. Particularly, the sending of images was challenging. We ending up solving this by using base-64 encoding for the images. \nWhile the data was on the server, another challenge proved to be updating the web page in real-time. We attempted to solve this using WebSockets, but that proved another challenge in itself. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Despite the troubles with networking, we think the end result is really impressive. We're mostly proud of making an app that is able to easily transport data between multiple different platforms in real-time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>For all of us, we were working in environments outside of our comfort zone. All of us came away from this having learned a lot more about networking. The Leap Motion itself was also a first for all of us; working with it was a lot of fun. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Iodine Monoxide</h2>\n<p>Currently, our app supports only lessons made in Unity. A key feature that our app could use is a more extensible interface for the teacher to make lessons from the web page without ever having to touch Unity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.iodinemonoxide.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.iodinemonoxide.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.iodinemonoxide.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Web Sanitizer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Web Sanitizer \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/079/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Before Sanitizer</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Web Sanitizer \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/085/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>After Sanitizer</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Many times while browsing the web, we are forced to see some images and content that we can't unsee. Such content is often disturbing and not appropriate to be viewed in public. It is even more harming when children are exposed to it. Battling this type of online harassment we decided to come up with a chrome plugin called Web Sanitizer. Most of the existing solutions maintain a white and blacklist of sites and block the whole site for the purpose. Many times it is not required as images come from ads and website's recommendation. We use machine learning algorithm provided by Clarifai to flag images with content that can be classified as adult and violent. This solution can be easily extrapolated to videos as well. \nSo Happy Carefree Browsing!!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Web Sanitizer is a chrome plugin which classifies the images in the page as adult and violent, using deep learning and if flagged replaces it with a pre-set image. It preserves the page layout and doesn't block the whole site. The deep learning algorithm is done by the API provided by Clarifai. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Before rendering the images on the web page, we take its URL and check with Clarifai's API for the tags it can be associated with. Then we match the image tags with a pre formed list of bad-words indicating adult content. If flagged, we redirect this image load request to a pre set safe image. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Defer the HTTP GET request for the images until images have been categorized.</li>\n<li>Since our Javascript runs as a background process, it was difficult to synchronize the function calls. </li>\n<li>Keeping ourselves up and running for 24hrs, looking at the ugliest photographs on web. :)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Finishing our project in time.</li>\n<li>A ready to use plugin, which we can use ourselves use while browsing in class :p</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Javascript can make you go nuts if running in background making multiple async requests and you have race conditions all around</li>\n<li>We as a team can push ourselves to the corners we haven't seen before.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for Web Sanitizer</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Filter out the video content as

scan their network for vunerable IoT devices. SpaceSecure then tries to gain root access to the vunerable devices by trying to brute using defualt passwords and any similar hacker exploit imported into the code. Then when the program verifies root access and it gives the owner the option to change of devices password to something more secure. </p>\n<p>With other devices tested against exploits, it gives administrators a head start on patching devices that were previously unknown to be vunerable to the exploits tested them.

We predict that better communication between <strong>restaurants with a surplus of perfectly good food</strong> and <strong>food banks who aim to help those living in poverty</strong> will cause a decrease in both people living in food insecurity and amount of food wasted.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>GrubShare bridges the gap between restaurants and food banks by offering a fast and efficient way for _ restaurants to let food banks know they have surplus food that day _ and displaying _ the shortest route among restaurants for food bank drivers _.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built GrubShare using Python and a Django Framework, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We also implemented ESRI's Route Selector API to find the most efficient routes for a given set of restaurants.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a lot of issues with Django and ESRI's API since half of our team was not experienced with programming a project of this scale.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of finishing a product from start to finish within 24 hours. We're also proud of the fact that it addresses real social issues with a pragmatic solution.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Delegating work between teammates made the work less intensive on each of us and allowed us to specialize in aspects we excel at. Teamwork makes the dream work!</p>\n<h2>What's next for GrubShare</h2>\n<p>We plan on improving the web application with the help of our Computer Science department at Washington and Lee University, introducing it to food banks in Lexington, VA, such as Campus Kitchen, as well as restaurants. We hope our application will have a positive impact.</p>\n<p>49 million Americans are living in food insecurity while 70 billion pounds of food goes to waste annually in the United States. GrubShare is an all-in-one platform for connecting food banks to restaurants and grocers with excess food. Donors simply indicate the quantity and value of their excess food and volunteers and employees of food banks are notified. Then, site provides a fastest-calculated route to pick up a series of donations in a timely fashion. The program automatically tracks donations and provides up-to-date tax-deductible savings for businesses who are able to save 25% on otherwise sunk costs\u2014while simultaneously feeding hungry people. Food banks reduce costs, increase their ability to server a larger market, and require less staff to coordinate an otherwise labor intensive process.</p>\n<p>Donors save thousands of dollars. Food banks increase impact. And GrubShare solves food insecurity, one meal at a time.</p>\n<p>Advantages- Our advantage is simple: no other platform is more user friendly, takes less than 20 seconds to make a donation, or integrates the power of ArcGIS map technology to make the fastest, most efficient routes possible.</p>\n<p>The Technical Side-</p>\n<p>There are two primary users for GrubShare: Food Banks and Food Providers (i.e. restaurants, grocers, and stores with excess food that would otherwise be discarded). New users register accounts and then have access to a series of primary functions:</p>\n<p>Food Providers: On any given day, if a Food Provider has excess food, they may submit a form to indicate the quantity and value of their intended donation. They will receive an automatic notification of when the food will be picked up. Food Providers\u2019 accounts will also have a running total of meals provided and dollars saved via tax deductible donations. In order to encourage frequent donations, the home page of the site will eventually provide statistics on top-donors.</p>\n<p>Food Banks: Having selected a specific service region, Food Banks receive donation notifications from Food Providers in that area. Registered Food Banks may log in to their account to see a series of pins on a map of their region to see the donations of that day. Based on potentially limited resources, Food Banks select the donation sites they will be able to visit. Then, using ArcGIS map technology, they receive the fastest-possible route between locations, automatically notifying Food Providers of their estimated arrival times. Additionally, there are plans to implement a ranking system to note the quality and reliability of donations from Food Providers. Food Banks may choose to decline offers from Food Suppliers who frequently have expired or inedible donations.</p>\n<p>GrubShare seeks to tackle one of the most prominent social problems of the 21st century by providing cutting edge technology to the non-profit sector. Reduce waste and feed the hungry by sharing grub with GrubShare.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/denningk/GrubShare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/denningk/GrubShare\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/themina1/GrubShare\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/themina1/GrubShare\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://grubshare.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://grubshare.org\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>grubshare.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend.

When we saw that real-world usefulness was a judging criteria, we instantly knew what we would have to do a project about. This election has been full of noise, and severely lacking in signal - there is some great information out there on the web but it's hard to find and even harder to interpret. We hope to solve these problems with Candidata. In our webapp, we only focus on bringing you data about the candidates - no tabloid interpretation or unsupported claims. We spent a chunk of time at the beginning of the project looking into what data people wanted, and we found that overwhelmingly people just wanted to see the facts and data. They want to know if a candidate is lying, they want to know where they stand in the polls, and they want to know if a candidate is \"bought-out\" with donations from large corporations.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The strength of Candidata comes from how it correlates data. When you visit the webapp, you get a nice overview of the candidates, with their most recent statements rated by politifact, their current poll standing as an average of a lot of different polls (as calculated by FiveThirtyEight, and the top overall campaign contributors. This data is all out there, and available to us through public APIs. For the average person, however, this data is incredibly difficult to parse. It's spread across multiple sites, hidden among a trove of unimportant figures, and it's not at all clear how the data relates to each other. As someone who studies political science, all of that correlation and important numbers jump out, and we hope that everyone else can see the data the same way with Candidata. We dug through many sources of election data and pulled out the important parts through APIs that ensure our webapp has the newest information at all times, and spent most of our time building a robust back-end that looks into these sources and brings together relevant data displaying them side-by-side like no other site had ever done before. Additionally, you can conveniently see the data on the issues you care about most by choosing an important issue for you and letting Candidata process the rest.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the webapp on top of Django and python, which lets us grab API data without any crossorigin data and allows us to cache data for an hour at a time so we don't keep hitting the APIs we pull from. Our front end is designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A couple of us were Django novices, so jumping into using it for the project was very challenging at first but extremely educational by the end!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>In 24 hours, we built a project that brings together data like no site before it. In order to do this, we had to build a robust backend that correlated relevant data, a daunting task that was incredibly rewarding when everything finally clicked.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned a lot in this project. We now have significant experience in Django and a much greater understanding of how it works, as well as valuable experience working with a team against a hard deadline.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Candidata</h2>\n<p>More data! With extra time, we can put in the grunt work to gather more searches and program in those correlations.

We had heard of Capital One's hackathon API, Nessie, and were interested in it. The best application we could think of to banking in the sharing economy was loans - creating a services for people (not banks, not companies) to give loans to each other could fundamentally redefine the meaning of loans. So we set out to create our peer-to-peer loan app, Floatr.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Floatr is a loan peer to peer loan platform using the Capital One Nessie API.  Users can directly receive money and make payments to other users.  Users that create loan offers have the ability to set the loans terms, such as principle, interest rate, and period.  Users that receive the loan, make payments using the app, however, all money transactions happen directly from one users account to the other.  The user's money never enters our hands.  This is very similar to the way other \"shared economy\" applications work, such as Uber, where they are simply the facilitator in connecting someone with a car with someone who needs a ride. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app uses an Android front-end making calls to a custom NodeJS API we created, which runs on an AWS server alongside a MongoDB database to make Nessie API. The Node server interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose, a Node library for interfacing JavaScript with Mongo. Our custom API stores user data, along with loan and payment history data, as well as making calls to Nessie to read the users' bank account information and complete transfers as loans and payments on loans.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Working with Android and Node.js was something new for the majority of our team.  This was a great challenge though, as we learned so much in the process of working on this project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>John is proud that he learned NodeJS and MongoDB basically completely from scratch in 24 hours.

However, for limited involvement products like hand blender, hdmi cable, electric shaver etc., there might not be much expert help available leaving user to go through several customer reviews for each product brand.  Based on a research article \u201cEcommerce consumer reviews: why you need them and how to use them\u201d (Graham Charlton, EConsultancy), 61% of customers read online review before making decision. Customer reviews are significantly more trusted (almost 12 times more) than descriptions provided by manufacturer.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our Web Application ShopGenie aims to help new users by presenting them with most talked about feature by other existing users and help them narrow down their search to the features that matter most to them rather than just relying on a 5 star point rating system. The recommendations are simplified and intuitive yet based on sound underlying analysis. ShopGenie is a one-stop shop that provides the best buying recommendation according to criteria\u2019s that actually matter to the consumer. As with our hand blender example, the new user will be able to input the feature that is most important to him/her such as value for money, ease of use, high speed etc. and our app will be able to recommend the top products as per the criteria. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Once the new user inputs the product of interest, ShopGenie lists all brands for the product from eCommerce website like BestBuy, Amazon, and other eCommerce website. The user can select any number of brand (minimum 3) and the App will rank the products based on sentiment score (rather than rating system). The user can then specify the feature that is of most interest to them. The App would then recommend top 3 brands most relevant to the feature. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Deriving measurable score from unstructured data like customer reviews is a big challenge. The natural language has a number of challenges of its own due to the complexity of data. Though we could not nullify the cons of natural language processing, we tried our best to extract the best data driven recommendations to the customer. Another challenge we ran into is integrating reviews from different e commerce website where the system performance is drastically affected, hence need to cut down ourselves into limited e commerce website</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Able to build an business value project in short span of time with complex analysis process and integration of different technologies. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the practical issues in natural language text processing, making the best judgement out of the available resources such as tools, technologies and man power. In addition to it time management and team work an additional learning.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ShopGenie</h2>\n<p>ShopGenie does have lot scope for value addition in terms of integrating with e commerce sellers, customer interactive visualizations for informed decision making for a wide variety of goods. It has the ability of integrating with wide range of e-commerce sites and business news papers and able to deliver a specific quick recommendation for customer out of available customer inputs. It can further go well on various machine learning processes to get deep insights for decision making for various businesses. It can have scope for building a mobile app technology becoming a must use assistant for shopping. We can include many business value additions such as running online coupons and other promos for enhancing additional revenue. It can bring predictive analytics based on the customer purchases pattern which is a great value addition in future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">phython</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas\">pandas</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/best-buy\">best-buy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on building the code for sentiment analysis  in python.

In such a situation, it is difficult (if not impossible) to avoid your harassers without locking down your account. Because we didn't want people's online experiences to be held hostage by a by an angry mob, we developed a tool for Twitter users that allows them to easily obtain a list of their potential harassers/abusers, which they can import to their blocked users list in seconds.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By tweeting \"subscribe\" to @HarassNC, a Twitter user can subscribe to our service. Upon subscribing, we'll scan the tweets that mention them and identify the users we believe are using abusive or otherwise harassing language. The subscribed user will receive a link to a .csv file that contains user ids of these potential abusers, which they can easily import to Twitter in order to instantly block a large group of users (when we give subscribers their list of harassers, we give them step-by step instructions describing how to import the .csv file into their block list). \nAdditionally, we send out replies to identified harassers, letting them know that we have identified their tweets as potentially harassing. In our tweets to potential harassers, we encourage them to carefully consider the language they use online. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Twitter4J package to interact with the @harassNc twitter account, which served as the user interface of our software. Our Kotlin and Java project then stored files on Amazon web services, and then we again used Twitter4J to send users the links to their files.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We couldn't automatically flag tweets for harassment using the Twitter API, so we had to pivot to using other anti-harassment methods.\nWe couldn't contact users by direct message due to Twitter's default privacy settings. As a result, we had to switch over to using standard \"@ replies\" on Twitter.\nRate limits on twitter prevent us from mass-monitoring all tweets that are sent and flagging potential harassment before the person that is harassed even sees it.\nWe had to find a way to deliver the list of harassers to subscribers. Although we were initially hesitant to offer them a simple download link (as we thought it would appear \"sketchy\" to our users), what we eventually decided was that this solution would work, as we'd only be offering these links to subscribers who are already familiar with our service.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Making Twitter a <em>bit</em> less of an angry place.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Heron, despite eventually scrapping it from our program.\nWe became familiar with the Twitter4J library.\nIt was some of our team members' first times using IntelliJ and gradle.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HarassNC</h2>\n<p>We want to improve harassment detection using sentiment analysis.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kotlin</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/brain-murphy/hacknc-harassment\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/brain-murphy/hacknc-harassment\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I generated the original idea for the application and prepared the statements we send to both harassers and subscribers.

We then chose to have the user input various stops.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We created a functional app that would require only several more tweaks and improved data to be a full-fledged web app. We synthesized our varied skillsets into a cohesive and comprehensive final project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a great deal about the capabilities and power of Esri\u2019s API and how to work in Javascript, Python, and several API\u2019s. </p>\n<h2>What's next for RoadTrip</h2>\n<p>Extending RoadTrip to recognize not only attractions but also functional locations like stores or gas stops. Also, providing stops continuously throughout the trip rather than requiring user input of stops.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">python-+-javascript</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["nematodesarepeopletoo", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X1YiIiPUQR8?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"nematodesarepeopletoo \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/080/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Thirsty!

The future of phone-E funds is developing the web app that we have created into android and iOS apps that serve as clients for GPS data as well as portals to user data. The web app then becomes just a portal for user data. Ideally that would mean the implementation of an extensive back end. An upgrade of the UI is also warranted in order to display far more data in the friendly way as it does now. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">restapi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nessi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">googlefonts</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HackNC2016WOF/HackNC2016WOF.github.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HackNC2016WOF/HackNC2016WOF.github.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I handled the API implementation and UI design.

Our volunteering experience at hospitals and working with elderly people made us realize how scheduling and paying hospital visits can be uneasy and frustrating processes. For example, patients spend a long time waiting in telephone queues to schedule an appointment. The process can be similarly frustrating to the hospital staff in charge of receiving calls and entering new patient data, because they could have spent their time doing attending to more important tasks, which could then increase the quality of patient care. \nThe other two of us are passionate about applying chatbot to a new field. Conveniently, chatbot is an ideal platform for this application because it is interactive and easy to use from the user\u2019s perspective. As a result, we decided to use chatbot to relieve the burden of scheduling appointments and registering new patients from both the patient and the administrator side. \nMoreover, we thought about how troublesome it can be to find driving directions to the hospital and nearby pharmacies, especially for elderly patients not familiar with map services. Therefore, we expanded our original idea to also include map services that allows easy visualization of directions and traffic. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hospital patients can use our Facebook messenger chatbot to schedule appointments with specific physicians that fit their needs based on both the patients\u2019 and the physicians\u2019\u2019 availability. The map provides directions to the Duke Hospital, local pharmacies, and their homes. It also visualizes live traffic flow and sickness in the area using a built-in Sickweather application from ESRI.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the chatbot using Howdy Botkit with a Node.js frontend and the Facebook Development Console as the deployment platform (See <a href=\"https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-facebook.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/readme-facebook.md</a>). We hosted a local web server using localtunnel and an Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk instance. We used a google form linked to an online Excel spreadsheet to record new patient data. After the patient schedules their appointment, we integrated an ESRI platform using an ESRI ArcGIS API to link them to the map</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Localtunnel setup of the Facebook messenger chatbot, such as with setting up the correct host number.\nCoding the Node.js Howdy Botkit file using Javascript.\nMany syntax and data structure issues, since we are not too familiar with Javascript\nIssues with setup of the howdy botkit command structures\nStructuring the decision tree for the conversation and making it as simple as possible to fit the user\u2019s needs.\nMaking the ESRI web app public by deploying the webapp to the public.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Making a potentially long and uneasy scheduling process very intuitive to the user is the selling point of our product. We\u2019re proud of learning a new technology in a short time and successfully implementing it without major bugs or user issues. Most importantly, we take pride in using this technology to accomplish something that will make a difference in people\u2019s lives. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to build a chatbot and how to use the ESRI ArcGIS API. Moreover, we came to understand how to put ourselves into the user\u2019s perspective and how to think about accomplishing what the user needs in the most simple and straightforward way. Finally, we learned how to have fun at a hackathon :)</p>\n<h2>What's next for HealthSchedulingBuddy</h2>\n<p>A smaller, but necessary update to HealthSchedulingBuddy will be to account for users scheduling appointments for another person. In order to makes this possible, we are planning to ask in the beginning of the conversation: \u201cAre you scheduling the appointment for yourself or for someone else?\u201d Depending on the answer, the question prompts would either continue to use \u201cyou\u201d or to use \u201cthe patient\u201d. For example: \u201cAre you/ is the patient coming for a (a) new or (b) return visit?\u201d\nFurther, we would like to provide the user with a detailed time table for the entire hospital visit as a summary page at the end of the chatbot conversation. We will pull the driving time from the map and provide the times for when the patient should start driving, when the patient will arrive and when the appointment will begin. Additionally, we could provide a link to a page that summarizes driving directions that the user could print out or download. \nTo extend beyond chatbot and to make it even more user-friendly, we envision an automated text messaging service that sends a reminder of the entire schedule a day before the visit and an hour before the patient should start driving. Any updates in the schedule due to traffic or appointment changes would be accounted for in this messaging service. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">howdy</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pshi2005/HospitalSchedulingBuddy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pshi2005/HospitalSchedulingBuddy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8GM44Wc8JIbY1ZtajNsQXVscVE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8GM44Wc8JIbY1ZtajNsQXVscVE\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Github Octacat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Github Octacat \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/062/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>King DeviTAMA Octacat</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Github Octacat \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/063/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Odin Tamadra Octacat</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: Puzzles and Dragons</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Github Octacat: This is an Octacat inspired by our project for this HackNC.

However, being college students this would be prohibitively expensive. So instead, we wanted to do the next best thing. What if you could use an immersive map and controller to fly around and visit these places? By just typing in a location, you would be able to visit anywhere in the world and immerse yourself in the scenery. This simple concept formed the basis for our application.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using this application, you are able to take a \"grand tour\" of the world. Set up your tour route and then launch the application and watch as you are taken to each of these locations. At each location, you are able to use the Xbox controller to fly around and explore, spending as much time as you want before moving onto the next location on your tour. Additionally, we pseudorandomly generate checkpoints on the map that you must find before moving to the next tour location. This element allows the application to also function as a game - one must explore the world learning about the culture and scenery while trying to find the checkpoint.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This application was built leveraging the Esri map API. We use this API to dynamically generate not only the satellite imagery, but also 3D topographical information and textures to make it as lifelike as possible. We integrate this all seamlessly with JavaFX and another API to interface with the Xbox One Controller in order to create the most immersive experience possible</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It was difficult to get the Xbox One controller to function properly with the API we were using and integrate it inside of the Esri API to control the mapping software.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Creating a tangible, working application that meets all the goals that we set out at the beginning of this hackathon. Decompiling the source code of the APIs to figure out how they worked when the documentation failed us. Learning how to use the robust Esri map API to make a very cool final product.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to decompile source code. The intricacies of JavaFX and threading on Java. How to use the Esri map API. Creating a tangible deliverable in a short time frame.</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Grand Tour</h2>\n<p>Adding more overlays from the Esri API. Integrating the Esri API with another API that pulls points of interest based on location data. Dynamically adding points to the map based on parameters and adding sounds.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xbox\">xbox</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/benl1/HackNC.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/benl1/HackNC.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on reading input from the Xbox 360 controller and displaying graphic overlays along with other symbols on the application.

We wanted to make it easier for us and other college students to find internship opportunities based on their skills and interests.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There are three aspects to Tintern. First is a web crawler which explores the vast web and creates a database of companies and the internships they offer, along with relevant data such as programming languages, location, position, industry type, and others. The second part is a Facebook Messenger chatbot which allows people to communicate their interest and skills in a natural way. The chatbot then displays relevant internships. (You must be added to our Facebook App as a developer in order to use the chatbot since we did not have time to go through the Facebook approval process for chatbots.) The third component is a companion website built from scratch, based on the design of <a href=\"https://www.typeform.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Typeform</a> which will display relevant internships based on the skills and interests you enter.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the web crawler using Java and regular expressions to identify internships and relevant data. The data was stored in a json file which was uploaded to a Heroku Node.js express server so queries could be run against it. This data was used to construct an API which the server could access directly, and the website through a POST request. The Facebook Messenger chatbot was built using Facebook developer tools, and all of the language processing is done on our Heroku express server. In addition, we used jquery to make the website modern, clean and responsive, while following material design conventions.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Web crawling presented a great challenge since websites do not necessarily share similar structures. Thus, information could not be extracted simply, requiring us to create a dynamic crawler which adapted to the structure of the website being crawled to better find and analyze data. Furthermore, it was difficult to decide what parameters to extract, because companies do not all have the same internship information. In the end, we decided to focus on company size, location, programming languages, platform, industry category and internship position.</p>\n<p>Making the Node.js server was challenging because it had to host a Facebook Messenger chatbot while also hosting a dynamic website, along with an in-house search API. Setting up the express routing to retrieve the correct data and respond to POST and GET requests for the chatbot and website proved difficult. In addition, the algorithm for the in-house search API had to be optimized to minimize time delays while handling data requests from multiple sources. Our search API scored each internship position based on how well it fit the user's skills and interests. Furthermore, making a chatbot which responded to unstructured human input was nontrivial, and required the use of various contextual language processing methods.</p>\n<p>Making a responsive and clean modern website from scratch was very difficult because of the fragmentation of browsers in terms of size and javascript/html/css handling. Adding the jquery to respond to the POST request and render the appropriate results page was also a challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the web crawler, chatbot, in-house API, and companion website.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about web crawling and regular expressions, language analysis, Node.js frameworks, and jquery.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tintern</h2>\n<p>The next step for Tintern is to submit the chatbot to Facebook for approval, and increase the number of internship position in our database. (We currently have over 200 positions in the database.) </p>\n<h2>Domain Name</h2>\n<p>We registered a custom domain name matchtintern.com on Domain.com this morning (it took a while to get the free code form the rep) so it still doesn't point to our server (DNS is currently updating).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">messenger</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://hacknc2016.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hacknc2016.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hacknc2016.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/internmatcherbot/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/internmatcherbot/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.facebook.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Joseph-DeChicchis/hacknc2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Joseph-DeChicchis/hacknc2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Joseph-DeChicchis/hacknc2016_backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Joseph-DeChicchis/hacknc2016_backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Node.js backend.

So, when we realized we had no transactions, we had script our own data generation in a random fashion and then for few specific merchants and customers. This was time taking and almost took up one of the hackers' half day.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Given the troubles we ran into and the minimal experience of few of us, we performed really well. We are proud of being able to complete the app successfully. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to play with financial data and also how to use esri maps. We learnt few cool things on the way. </p>\n<h2>What's next for BScouts</h2>\n<p>BScouts uses location as the clustering parameter. We can use smarter clustering algorithm. We can also use a more complex algorithm to predict the new business, not just the location.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nessie</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://HackerPack.github.io/BScouts\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://HackerPack.github.io/BScouts\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>HackerPack.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HackerPack/BScouts/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HackerPack/BScouts/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Create and push sample data on accounts, customers, merchants, purchases using capital one API", "", ""]], ["WhackMD", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WhackMD \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/433/997/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Check it out:</h2>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.whackmd.com/diagnose/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.whackmd.com/diagnose/</a></strong></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Hunted", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hunted \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/000/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Title Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hunted \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/001/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pre-Game Setup</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hunted \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/002/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Swordsman Wins!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Hunted</h1>\n<p>A board game involving a swordsman and a spearman attempting to hunt each other down one square at at time.

But the victim is not always in the right state of affairs to inform their loved ones about their situation themselves.</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>The app is context-aware as it monitors and detect a mobile user\u2019s environment using sensors in the phone such as GPS, accelerometer, pressure, time. For this purpose we have used the Google Awareness API. Using this API, the app can fetch several kinds of contexts like time, location, nearby places, activity (walking, driving, etc.) and weather.  Further, we use PlaceILive API to detect the safety of a neighborhood the user is in. Also, we have integrated a speech recognition engine using Pocketsphinx API which continuously listens for an emergency word (like \"help me\"). Based on the input from all the APIs, the app can make predictions about whether a user is in an emergency or potentially risky situation. The primary goal of the app would be to send pulse updates to an emergency contact about the user\u2019s environment if some set of conditions (based on the contexts) are met.\n<br/>\nThe app defines Fences, as used in the Awareness API, which are a combination of inputs from different sensors in the phone. We can register multiple Fences in the device, for instance:<br/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the user is walking/ running/ driving after 12 AM in a neighborhood which is unsafe.<br/></li>\n<li>If the user is driving in bad weather conditions like heavy ice or snow.<br/></li>\n<li>In the emergency situation if person is being assaulted or mugged and he/she is shouting for \"help\"<br/>...etc.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n<p>These Fences are monitored, at regular intervals, by a daemon process in the user's device. If any of the fence is triggered (a set of conditions are met), the app starts sending pulse SMSs to an emergency contact.</p>\n<h2>API used</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Google awareness API<br/></li>\n<li>Pocketsphinx-android<br/></li>\n<li>PlaceILive API</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app was built in 4 stages:<br/></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Integrating the Google Awareness API and creating \"fences\" for emergency situations.<br/></li>\n<li>Building the speech recognition engine using Pocketsphinx (a library by CMU).<br/></li>\n<li>Making REST calls to PlaceILove endpoint to get safety predictions about a particular place.<br/></li>\n<li>Using the pre-set emergency contact to send information like location, nearby places, weather conditions, etc.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>As the awareness API uses multiple sensors, synchronizing the result from their callbacks was tricky to handle.<br/></li>\n<li>The most challenging task was to create the speech recognition engine which can listen to a user 24*7 and precisly predict the emergency word. This aspect of the app still has a lot of scope for improvement.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The app uses the feedback from all the mobile sensors like GPS, accelerometer, pressure, etc. to predict the environment of a user. <br/></li>\n<li>The app also continuously listens to the user for an emergency code-word (\"help me\").<br/></li>\n<li>Using the sensor data as input to Google Awareness API, it predicts the nearby places. Using this as input to PlaceILove API, it predicts the safety level of the place.<br/></li>\n<li>If the app predicts a vulnerable situation based on all the aforementioned conditions, it starts sending pulse notifications to an emergency contact.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Future work</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>The speech recognition engine has a lot of scope for improvement.</li>\n<li>We can also integrate run-time adaption in the app i.e. if the user does not want to send alert notifications for some of the contexts (like if it is common for the user to walk during night) then they may chose to deselect such notifications. This would evolve into the app having different behavior for different users.</li>\n<li>While driving we can detect the speed limit in a particular area and use that feedback to improve our predictions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Domain.com - Best Domain Name Registered with Domain.com</h2>\n<p>We registered the domain <a href=\"http://unagi-tech.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">unagi-tech.com</a> thanks to the generous people at Domain.com</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Built with :heart: at HackNC by <a href=\"http://unagi-tech.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unagi-Tech</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-awareness-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pocketsphinx-texttospeech</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/arjundatt/Unagi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/arjundatt/Unagi\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on making the app context aware by making use of different sensors in the phone.", "Worked on the ux, messaging service and the neighborhood safety api", "Developed Front end functionalities and worked on continuous speech recognition  service.

This webapp is meant to help solve this problem by providing a playground to experiment with component and angle vectors, including switching between forms and performing basic vector operations.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app is effectively a static playground in which different vectors can be graphed, and operations can be run on them. Operations include switching between component form and angle form; vector addition and subtraction; cross product; scalar/dot product; scalar multiplication and division; finding the angle between two vectors; and computing the angle between two vectors.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our app in Javascript, basing its structure on the Three.js library which made 3D output fairly simple. From there, we collaborated to work to each of our strengths in designing an API and UI.\nOnce we had a base for the project, we came up with a few ideas and split them up into several suites, each with its own set of functions.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Myriad bugs came from our choices of IDEs and various lack of error safety. But every problem detected was a learning experience.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The app is complete in the form we intended it - we met our design goal for our first hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Javascript development is difficult and confusing, but it's certainly easier when we use just one set of external libraries. Delegating different parts of the project to different team members worked well.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Vectors</h2>\n<p>Implementing more functionality that will make it easier to use for solving physics problems - for example, placement of point charges and circular vectors.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://columbusdong.github.io/HackNC/web/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://columbusdong.github.io/HackNC/web/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>columbusdong.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Mapping Twitter Sentiment", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mapping Twitter Sentiment \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/133/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing page of website.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mapping Twitter Sentiment \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/134/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Example of ESRI API for coloring map based on sentiment from tweets.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mapping Twitter Sentiment \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/434/135/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Examples of tweet classification.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to learn more about machine learning in the context of noisy Twitter datasets and to draw insights that are very sought after by companies and politicians, many of whom invest great amounts of money into learning how they are viewed by the public. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The program trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with Laplace smoothing to classify tweets as \"positive,\" \"negative,\" or \"neutral.\" It uses two different feature vectors: one for linguistic data (such as number of verbs, question marks, adjectives, etc.) and another \"bag of words\" vectorizer. After training on a dataset of 1.5M tweets, it can correctly classify tweets with <strong>86.7% accuracy!</strong> The user can enter any topic and a Python script will mine the tweets, classify them, and plot the data with the ESRI API. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This uses Python machine learning and natural language processing libraries, along with the Twitter and ESRI API's. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was a difficult project partly because of the technical machine leraning elements, such as joining vectorizers, pickling the trained model to avoid retraining, and experimenting with different parameters. It was also difficult to integrate the components of the ESRI API the classified tweets. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Mapping Twitter Sentiment</h2>\n<p>We can improve the speed by investing more into preprocessing tweets and methods for dimensionality reduction of the trained model.

My absence on that day was even worsened by the fact that an amazing guest speaker was giving the class a lecture on what school don\u2019t teach you about the business world, a topic that had long captured my attention since I first saw it. Even though asking a friend to record the whole speech for me would be a valid solution to the problem I was facing, it would be better if I could control a recording device remotely through voice command only, considering my health status. What\u2019s more, if the recorded audio file could be automatically transcribed into text file or even summarized into an outline with a few sentences only, my compromised logical thinking ability under severe cold would be greatly assisted when I tried to understand the speech. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>Tachyonic Summarizer</em> is an <strong>Internet-based</strong> IoT device with <strong>remote control</strong> through Amazon Alexa. A user <strong>miles away</strong> from <em>Tachyonic Summarizer</em> is able to activate its voice recording function through our AWS server and Amazon echo with built-in Alexa personal assistant service. Recorded audio files will be <strong>concurrently transcribed</strong> into text files and saved on the <em>Tachyonic Summarizer</em>. Once transcribed, the user can issue voice command through Amazon echo to the device to <strong>retrieve</strong> the files, and Amazon echo will <strong>read out</strong> the most relevant <strong>outlines of the transcription</strong>.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We have set up an <strong>Amazon Alexa skill</strong> and an <strong>AWS EC2 instance</strong> that handles requests from Amazon echo and <em>Tachyonic Summarizer</em> users. Amazon echo is able to communicate with the AWS server through specially formatted <strong>JSON</strong> data packages, and the AWS server (which runs a <strong>python flask</strong> service) sends commands to and receives text data from the <em>Tachyonic Summarizer</em> (which also runs a <strong>python flask</strong> service) using <strong>http</strong> and <strong>https</strong> protocol. \nDue to the lack of Intel Edison micro-computer, we are using a MacBook Pro to emulate the functioning of the supposed-to-be portable <em>Tachyonic Summarizer</em>, but the same can be easily achieved by simply replacing the MacBook with <strong>any ARM-based micro-computer</strong>. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p><strong>Challenge 1</strong>: A recorded long speech is not able to be transcribed into text file by making a single request to google speech to text API due to file size limit</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong> : We used audio recording buffer and multi-threading to process piecewise the audio segments so that transcription is done concurrently with the recording process</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge 2</strong>: Uncertain environmental noise that compromises an accurate speech to text conversion</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: We employed dynamic adjustment of audio energy ratio and energy threshold on Tachyonic Summarizer so that recordings are maximumly denoised before sent to Google speech to text service</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge 3</strong>: We do not have a SSL certificate which is required by Alexa skill setup</p>\n<p><strong>Solution</strong>: We ran ngrok on the AWS server to obtain a wildcard certificate to satisfy the requirement</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Tachyonic Summarizer works unexpectedly well under fine Internet connection environment. Voice control through Amazon echo on Tachyonic Summarizer has unnoticeable latency.</li>\n<li>Users are able to specify the file names to save the transcription files through Amazon echo</li>\n<li>The

He took advantage of built-in LeapMotion methods to read in hand motions, equating certain (1) finger extensions and (2) palm positioning with ASL alphabet letters. In many cases (i.e. E, M, N, O, S, T, Z, G, Q, J, L, R), Scott recalibrate to simplify letter selection (e.g. \u201cDid you mean\u2026\u201d, \u201cPlease raise thumb for\u2026\u201d, \u201cSpread your hand to confirm\u2026\u201d). The software to do this is in the Main.cpp file.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Sam and Sarah spent most of their time writing the code for ghost.cpp, which contains the majority of the game functionality itself. The Main.cpp and ghost.cpp interface through the \u201cinsert()\u201d method in which a translated letter of the alphabet gathered from the user is accumulated on the current word string held in ghost.cpp. General rules for the game (which closely resembles \u201cHORSE\u201d in basketball) are enumerated below:\n</code></pre>\n<p>(1) 2 players total \n(2) Player 1 starts and says one letter\n(3) Player 2 follows and says the next letter \u2026 flip flops back and forth\n(4) One player can choose to challenge the other player at any time on the word being created\n(5) Once a word is created, player that said the finishing letter loses &amp; is assigned appropriate GHOST letter (an additional one for each of the mistakes)\n(6) OBJECTIVE: To extend the word being spelled as much as possible without making up random junk words/ avoiding being challenged on the word by opponent.

It was definitely a fun time had by all - each of us really enjoyed our first true hacckathon! Thanks to UNC and all the sponsors who made it possible.
