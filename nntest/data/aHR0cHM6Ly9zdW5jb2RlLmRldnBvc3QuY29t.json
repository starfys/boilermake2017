Several CS programs specifically target Low and Middle Income (LMI) households. During a six-month pilot program in New York, all new Community Solar project applications required 20% LMI inclusion in their subscriber base. Unfortunately, only one project was approved and the program ended. The perceived risk of the LMI market is currently based on FICO credit scores and related equivalents. This risk perception is fed by lack of historical knowledge of consumers and renewable energy systems. The successful expansion of community solar depends on the development of a more accurate measurement of repayment risk, the SunScore.  </p>\n<p>A subscriber\u2019s SunScore is calculated using multiple key metrics, including 12-month utility payment history, length of residence, length of employment, public service employment, household size, number of dependents, and annual income, among others.  Based on the SunScore, LMI candidates who show low repayment risk are identified as promising candidates for CS and those with high repayment risk are provided educational tools.</p>\n<p>Participation in the SunScore Program offers several benefits in addition to allowing a larger community to participate in CS than otherwise would. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. Participants are educated in both renewable energy and credit scores, with opportunity to build and improve their credit score through participation. By lowering the energy bills of LMI households, subsidies such as the California Alternate Rates for Energy Program (CARE) can also be reduced. In 2015 alone, CARE spent over 6 million dollars to provide energy to low income homes.</p>\n<p>The idea is to make lenders more comfortable financing community solar projects knowing that essential electric utility service payments have a low degree of repayment risk.</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://sunscore.herokuapp.com/ \" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sunscore.herokuapp.com/ \">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sunscore.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/michaelguia/sunscore.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/michaelguia/sunscore.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Developer", "", "", "", ""]], ["VARsanity", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A gap exists in the market now for installer-enablement tools.  Current providers are not thinking through the near-future rapid adoption of storage and other energy management tools.  Current providers try to enable a homeowner, or an installer, but not both.  Current providers think of storage as a piecemeal add-on to solar, not that solar and storage are inextricably-linked components of the total energy-system of the future.  We hope to disrupt all current providers and develop a tool that is ready to funnel the future complexity of the solar/storage landscape into actionable insights for homeowners and installers!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>VARSanity takes a homeowner's address and completes detailed analysis on PV generation, rates, and load to recommend a specific PV+Storage system size.  Following that recommendation, after a user clicks on a system, we display installers that homeowners can choose and then generate a lead for that installer.  For installers, more detailed analysis on system size and storage optimizations are displayed which they can use to have a conversation with customers in person.  After a specific system-combination is chosen, installers can export component lists (BOMs) in order to fine-tune the energy system using last-mile software such as Sighten or Folsom Helioscope.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used links to consumption data from utilityapi, rate-tariff information form utilityapi and genability, and our understanding of storage-interactions with solar to develop our back-end within genability and a data analysis platform in R.  Our front-end was designed using bootstrap.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into challenges thinking through the best views to display to both an installer and a homeowner.  Also, we had to figure out the best balance between model-complexity and user-simplicity and sided with ensuring things are as simple as possible for a homeowner on the front-end while have a robust back-end to handle the complexity.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have built a prototype web app that dynamically calculates the savings a homeowner would would achieve by installing a solar PV/battery system.  </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A LOT!

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>We are starting an open-source project to accelerate off-grid solar project development in areas affected by blackouts, high energy prices, and \u200black of centralized information. The enrGxs platform will enable investors, developers, and engineers to collaborate on these projects and see returns on social, environmental, and financial levels.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We have been working on off-grid solar projects with a company called Gham Power since 2010. We work primarily in Nepal and southeast Asia, serving part of the 1.3 billion people in the world who live without any access to electricity, mostly in rural areas using kerosene lamps for lighting, paying costs as high as $5/kWh. There are another 1 billion who suffer from unreliable electricity grid and long daily blackouts. Many businesses run diesel generators for backup, and face increasing fuel costs and frequent shortages, aside from the health hazards.</p>\n<p>Distributed off-grid solar is a great solution for this, but it hasn\u2019t scaled because most business models are limited to small home systems and solar lanterns, and most customers cannot finance large systems. However, these same customers are willing to install large systems under lease, PPA, or Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) financing (similar to more mature solar markets like US and Germany). So, this is a great opportunity for off grid project developers, provided they can get project financing, which has been a major hurdle.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, institutional investors with energy access project funds (e.g. ADB, IFC) can\u2019t find enough \u201cgood\u201d projects to invest in. This is due to their high investment threshold (minimum of $5 mm), whereas the typical \u201clarge\u201d off grid project size is $5k to $50k. Even crowdfunding sites don\u2019t have sizable pipelines of energy projects because most small developers aren\u2019t PowerPoint or Excel savvy and usually need a local intermediary to facilitate entering project data entry into crowdfunding site. However, if there are standard ways to define the data, metrics, and overall design of these projects, then not only projects can be developed much faster, but they can also be aggregated, as collectively they represent a significant investment opportunity.</p>\n<p>That's why we are starting an open source project where we can share tools, templates, and best practices for off-grid solar project development we have developed at Gham Power over the years, and invite other practitioners working in developing countries around the world to help make these tools better by using, sharing, and adding their own refinements. That way, we collectively build a standard set of tools and templates, refined via a community-led process, and anyone can use these tools to rapidly assess project sites, do basic system technology design and estimate costs, build financial models to calculate ROI, and thus end up with a fairly complete set of documents to get their projects financed. </p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>enrGxs is meant to be an open source repository of tools and templates that help develop investment-ready off grid projects. These tools and templates cover feasibility assessment, technology design, financial model, and guidelines for installation and operations and maintenance.</p>\n<p>We invite an ever-growing number of experts and field practitioners to join our team to develop/refine tools and templates for different system types, new geographies, and multiple financing structures. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created an Android App for project developers to collect site specific data to qualify a project site. We then created a web application in JavaScript that makes use of project site data and asks the user to add other variables to create a PV system design for the off-grid project. It then uses a Google spreadsheet to calculate project ROI which includes financial analysis as well as social and environmental impact analysis.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>Main issue for us was time given we were trying to cover three fairly vast problem areas within our app (site selection / qualification, system design, ROI analysis).</p>\n<p>Technology-wise, we found a way to call a Google sheet via an API call, so this allowed us to create the ROI model in Google sheet and call that via API's to get our ROI metrics. This part took more trial-and-error than we'd have liked. There was also some challenge in getting data from Android app available to our web application using Firebase.</p>\n<h2>What's next for enrGxs</h2>\n<p>We are open sourcing everything we have developed during this hackathon via our GitHub site.</p>\n<p>Please consider joining our team even post-hackathon -- we need help from UX/UI designers and developers to join our team and build out the initial structure / POC for this open source project so that (a) we have a basic framework where we can put existing templates from Gham Power, or build new ones; and (b) we can invite other off-grid solar project developers from around the world to refine these template and build new ones using an open source model.</p>\n<p>We also have many crazy stories to share from our combined field experiences around the world -- and hopefully they can help you give enrGxs a structure that will enable hundreds and thousands of local solar entrepreneurs in developing countries develop investment-grade solar projects and scale the deployment of renewable energy in their communities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-spreadsheets\">google-spreadsheets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/enrGxs/enrGxs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/enrGxs/enrGxs\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["UX and web design, front-end dev with Bootstrap.", "", "", "", ""]], ["Hack the Bike", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To harness human power in transitioning the world to 100% clean energy</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Hack the Bike</h2>\n<p>xxx</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/HackTheBike/Bike-Data-Visualization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/HackTheBike/Bike-Data-Visualization\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["UI UX from photoshop to Html CSS .", "I worked the data visualization along with Simon, literally hacking away at the bike and recording the data produced from the machine.

His friend's uncle had received a bid in the mail from a solar project developer to lease part of his farmland for a solar project, and he was not sure what would be a fair price for the land lease.  Ahmed and his friend did some research to find comparison points online but could not find any.  This was the genesis for TerraX. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TerraX is an exchange that connects land owners with solar and wind developers.   Land owners can place part of the acreage of their farm on the platform and receive bids from multiple solar and wind project developers looking to lease land for project development.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it in Ruby-on-Rails, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Materialize.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Two challenges we ran into include: 1) disintermediation and 2) licensing as a broker.  Regarding 1) we do not want to be circumvented by the developer and the installer; that would hurt our revenues.  We plan to manage that risk by only charging landowners when we can receive a bid that's premium to their minimum threshold, incentivizing them to work with us.  We also plan to use a non-circumvention agreement with developers who join the platform.  2) We may need to be licensed as brokers to operate; we plan to pursue that licensing when executing on the business plan.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud and excited to share the functional MVP we've developed today.  We are also excited by the market potential.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that there is a tremendous amount of farmland available for solar and wind project development; far more than enough to meet the Clean Power Plan.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Land Lease Marketplace</h2>\n<p>We plan to talk to farmers and project developers to seed our platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\"
