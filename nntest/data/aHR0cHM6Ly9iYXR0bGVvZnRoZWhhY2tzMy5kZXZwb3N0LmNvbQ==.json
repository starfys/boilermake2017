OneApp grabs the relevant app from a server, compiles the code and sends the result directly to the user's phone.  Theoretically, OneApp could process any React Native app in this way.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We modified React Native by intercepting communication to its server and inserting our own code. We also built a number of modules.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Hacking a framework like React Native is difficult. You can very easily get deeply lost in some stack trace which will not give you the functionality that you want.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Building something said to be impossible!

It was inspired by videos of politicians singing pop songs, which must be meticulously stitched together. VidSmash makes it easy to stitch similar videos for songs, but also other projects, such as markov-chain generated TED talks.</p>\n<h1>How It Works</h1>\n<h2>Caption Retrieval</h2>\n<p>First, we pick a source for a list of YouTube videos. For our demo, we scraped the TED channel. Next, we try to download transcripts for those videos (which are not always accessible). YouTube transcripts give the start times of phrases, but not individual words.</p>\n<p>We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to approximate the number of syllables in each word, allowing us to estimate the speaking time of individual words given the speaking time of an entire phrase.</p>\n<h2>Clip Merging</h2>\n<p>These words are then intelligently split into re-useable clips, which try to use the most accurately timed words wherever possible. One heuristic we used to predict which words would be sampled most accurately was the position of the word in the phrase. Words in the beginning of the phrase have an exact start time, so can be clipped more precisely than words occurring later in the phrase.</p>\n<p>Arbitrary text, song data, or markov-generated TED talks can be entered into our web application, and split into words that need to be merged. Using ffmpeg, we were able to merge our small snippets of individual words together. Additionally, we add the text of the word to the bottom of the video to aid in its interpretation.</p>\n<h2>TED Talk Generation</h2>\n<p>Markov Chains are a tool from probability theory that allow us to predict state transitions. If we consider a sequence of words as a beginning state, and the next word as the transition, we can use a large database of TED talk text to generate a TED-esque piece of text. This text can then be fed into our video generator to create an original TED video.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ffmpeg\">ffmpeg</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">markov-chain</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bryanyan/SongMash\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bryanyan/SongMash\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["HoundKit", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>About a week ago, Apple released SiriKit.

It adapts to your whimsical nature and waifish needs. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Since the dawn of time, tourists have bumbled around with maps. They have frantically switched between their Yelp and Google Maps and Eventbrite mobile apps to accommodate for their different touristy needs. We realized that the modern-day nomad would value an all-in-one mobile application that not only provides information pulled from all three of the previously mentioned apps but also adds a sense of exploration and wonder throughout the journey. </p>\n<p>Our mobile application works by using the Yelp and Eventbrite APIs to search for events that are 1) within the traveler's reach based on her method of transportation and 2) within the traveler's time constraints. Several events will be displayed to a traveler at a time, and when the traveler selects an event to attend, the Google Maps API is used to navigate the traveler to the desired destination. This continues until the traveler has completed her journey / reached her total intended time duration. After that she is presented with a photo timeline of her journey. How wander-ful. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Nobody knew how to make mobile apps. That was rough. </p>\n<p>We also officially started at 7 AM today. That was SUPER rough.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Yuta: great design. \nHelena: nothing yet. \nScott: yeah same. \nZach: I don't know... \nTiffany: great software engineering.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg must have an AWESOME cube office!! \nWe also know how to make mobile apps now. That's sick. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Nomad</h2>\n<p>We're headed towards ~One Direction~</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">figma</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">adobe-xd</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yarai/nomad-brown\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yarai/nomad-brown\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked with apis to find events", "", "", "", ""]], ["CROWS VR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Synesthesia</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Use sentiment analysis on tweets from a given location and generate an aesthetic representation of those emotions in a Unity environment</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Flask, Twitter, NLTK, Unity, Oculus</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>How do Oculus</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Rendering clouds in Unity</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for CROWS VR</h2>\n<p>A very long nap</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["deep-carver", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>deep-carver</h1>\n<p>A machine learning attention system to aid seam carving for content retargeting.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iRapha/deep-carver\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/iRapha/deep-carver\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Photon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/iHp9j1V.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://i.imgur.com/iHp9j1V.png</a>)</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>During the summer, Michael went on a trip to Europe with a few friends. He visited beautiful cities and landscapes and naturally everybody on the trip took lots of photos. The problem was, it was tedious and difficult the share the photos. There were lots of platforms that allow shared albums, but none of them were fast and seamless. Ultimately, Michael never got to see his friend's photos. Michael's struggle inspired us to build Photon -- automatic photo sharing among friends. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Photon automatically takes photos from your camera roll and intelligently shares it with relevant friends. We use geotagging, time, and contacts to figure out the right friends to share photos with. Only direct friends with contacts will be able to view photos. </p>\n<p>By using photo metadata, Photon only uploads photos that are necessary for sharing, making the application quick and efficient. The goal is for Photon to be out of the way, automatically syncing photos taken during group trips without any user action. Photon works with any photo app, as long as photos are in the Photo Album, Photon will work in the background to figure out if it needs to be shared. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Photon iOS was built with Objective-C and Swift. The backend was built with Flask.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Photon</h2>\n<p>Support for other platforms, better artificial intelligence. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on the backend.

We wanted to mi\nnimize this overhead so we could efficiently find the tab that we needed.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TabShifter is a Google Chrome extension that moves your tab to a logical place with your other tabs. Each tab is placed in a cluster with other tabs that are similar to it. Upon opening a tab, our backend returns an array of similarity scores between that tab and other open tabs. Then, we figure out which cluster that tab is most similar to and move that tab to that cluster. Additional features are added including coloring of favicons in a particular cluster to the same color for easy visualization of cluster start and ends.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our backend is built in Python and our tab data is stored as JSON. We integrated the Chrome API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble integrating all of the components of our extension, notably editing the JSON/moving the tab with the backend and the coloration of the tabs. We ended up moving much of our code to one place instead of decomposing it to separate classes as we had before.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Even though it doesn't completely work, we're proud that we were able to move tabs and mess with the coloration. In addition, we built a pretty dope backend.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We strengthened our Javascript skills and explore Chrome Extensions and the tabs API.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TabShifter</h2>\n<p>We'd love to use this ourselves! Next steps would include building a popup/window that triggers when hovering over a tab that delivers information about the cluster and fine tuning the threshold to manage what size of clusters we want.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vincentschen/tab_clustering\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/vincentschen/tab_clustering\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["built json manipulation (data storage of clusters) and calculated tab placement/alteration", "python backend and endpoint for cosine similarity w/ tf-idf vectors with web pages", "", "", ""]]]
