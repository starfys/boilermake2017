We broke Clarifai down into an equation: Picture + Clarifai = Tags. So why not flip that equation on its head and use tags to \"create\" a picture? Through the use of descriptive tags, Iris aurally illustrates a scene in the minds of the blind. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.\nWe also wanted to challenge ourselves to create an app that could be easily used by the visually impaired. By simply opening the app and sliding your device into your breast pocket with the camera peeking out, you're ready to go. Controls are simple with the Myo wristband, which enables the blind to interact with our app in a meaningful way.\nIris is a novel marriage of software and hardware, and we're excited for you to give it a try!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Iris is an application built to help those who can\u2019t see, experience vision in a new way. With a simple gesture, Iris captures an image and gathers data about the image. Then, this information is spoken directly to the user, without any physical interaction with the device.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Iris peeks out of the user\u2019s breast pocket, waiting until needed. Using the Myo armband, the user makes a fist to capture an image through Iris. The image is saved on the device and analyzed using the Clarifai API asynchronously. When the API returns information about the image, Android\u2019s text to speech functionality is used to read the attributes of the image to the user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Most of the challenges we faced were because of the many asynchronous threads required to make Iris function. The camera, Clarifai API, text to speech, and loading screen all run separate threads, making it extremely difficult to implement them all at once. When working with the camera, we had to get around using the built in camera software by using Android\u2019s hardware camera. The issue with this is that it is asynchronous, and we also have to handle raw image data, using byte streams and byte arrays. Our other significant issue was that the Myo armband became very unreliable at times, forcing us to recalibrate it before each use.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team is fairly new to asynchronous programming, and working on separate threads, so this entire project was a great challenge. We worked on having the calls to APIs asynchronously, as the APIs\u2019 documentation suggested, however with only 6 hours left, we had an application that broke every time the async tasks finished in the wrong order. However, after a significant amount of refactoring, we were able to organize the application in a more efficient manner, making it fully functional and capable of helping those who need it. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We really learned a great deal about the less common sides of Android development. File manipulation, camera usage, and asynchronous task management, were among these aspects. As CS majors we usually do not dabble on the hardware side of things, so working with the armband was also a big learning experience for us.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tts</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">domain.com</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://irishelp.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://irishelp.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>irishelp.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://majorleagueshaqing.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://majorleagueshaqing.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>majorleagueshaqing.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/willzma/iris\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/willzma/iris\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Honey I'm Home", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The drive to incorporate futuristic AI into the household for security and entertainment purposes.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Honey I'm Home combines facial recognition technologies, with home automation software to introduce the next generation of the smart household.

However, Clarifai couldn't detect cards, symbols, or numbers, and its training API was down for the majority of the event. So we decided to pivot and see what ideas we could come up with using only Clarifai's tags.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We tried hard on our first project idea, failed, then learned from our mistakes and tried even harder for this new idea. Ultimately, we met our goal of attempting to predict your Myers-Briggs type. One of the dev's type (obtained from the extensive personality test) was (see screenshots). These user's actual result will likely always be ESFP because of pressure to conform to social media and make yourself seem exciting.

In our scripts, we of course used the Clarafai API ([link] <a href=\"https://github.com/Clarifai/hackathon\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Clarifai/hackathon</a>), along with jQuery. Some visual elements were designed with the Processing language.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>JavaScript, Chrome extension development, and the Clarifai API itself were all new technologies we had to simultaneously learn while doing this project in only 24 hours. Each presented  a new set of problems none of us had ever dealt with before, such as understanding the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, facing security limitations of Chrome extensions, and learning how to properly call the Clarifai API.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>GreenLight provides an easy way to verify that any image link is safe to open. Furthermore, since GreenLight shows the list of resulting tags on an image, we hope that anyone using or developing the Clarifai service can use this extension to see results immediately and conveniently.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Along with all that we learned in general about programming the technologies we used, we also learned that identifying release-ready milestones is an important goal to strive for as software engineers.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GreenLight</h2>\n<p>We hope to improve GreenLight in many ways. We'd like to improve the visual design of the popup, making it easier on the eyes, as well as responsive to the area it needs to show a list of results. Our \"NSFW\" determination can be greatly expanded and enhanced. Additionally, we'd like to give another option where the user can choose their own keywords to scan for, as well as how many keywords should cause a \"Not safe\" report, and whether to show the list of resulting image tags. Finally, we'd like to integrate the extension to work with social media, to prevent users from accidentally uploading problematic photos.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spencerturkel/nsfw-catcher\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spencerturkel/nsfw-catcher\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the integration of the Clarifai API and the front-end browser action in the Google Chrome Extension.", "I worked on the visual design of the Chrome extension.", ""]], ["PicAPun", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A first-year math prodigy, two semi-decent web developers (hey, we're not going to lie!) and two clueless programmers turned a 4 hour project into the most amazing and awe-inspiring 23 hour pun generator EVER.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PicAPun turns any of your images into the most rad puns that will be envied by family and friends.

The same python API then submits some of these tags into a pun generator website. The python script then obtains the website source code and, with BeautifulSoup, parses the html content to obtain the different generated puns and places the image submitted, along with one of the random puns, into our own domain PicAPun.github.io domain.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Uffff, we ran into way more problems than we needed to, but from every challenge we learned something new. The most intense moment in the last 24 hours was figuring out how to integrate our python script into our javascript and ultimately into our website. Luckily, we used another one of our amazing resources: <strong>Mr. Juan</strong>, who helped us create our python API to be called by javascript. </p>\n<p>Another important issue that we unfortunately left for the end was trying to register our PicAPun.com domain with Domain.com. While we successfully registered our domain, unknowing to us, we left a part of the redirecting instructions out, and while we successfully resolved this with Domain.com's \"technical support,\" the DNS revisions will take about 24 to 48 hours to propagate, so stay tuned and look for us at PicAPun.com in the near future!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our most successful accomplishment was finishing a decent product in a timely fashion and having the opportunity to learn new implementations of different programming languages. Thank you SwampHacks!</p>\n<h2>What's next for PicAPun</h2>\n<p>In the near future we will hopefully implement a sharing button for social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. We hope to actually implement an upload button that will allow the user to directly upload their pictures from their computer or phones directly.

If you're a website owner and you wanted to find potential problems or get feedback on future website ideas, you could use our service to get dozens, hundreds, even thousands of user feedback. Usability testing isn't yet a crowded field, but the largest competitor would be UserTesting.com. Their model charges $49/per user giving feedback. However for SMBs this can price them out of the market. By leveraging Amazon Mechanical Turk, we've built a 100% completed automated, scalable system that can not only provide more volume of feedback, in a shorter time (due to more testing user availability) but also significantly cheaper. At $2 a user, we still make a sizable margin, and if you were a website owner spending $100 on usability testing, would you rather have 2 people's opinions, or 50?</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote a custom database class and 2 extending classes as a plugin for a WordPress install. The same plugin also handled both form submission (and HIT creation) on Amazon Turk, as well as using WordPress's built in cron to check for newly completed hits. We then leveraged WordPress's existing plugin ecosystem, as well as many conveniently inbuilt functions (like wp_mail) to communicate with our users.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into all sorts of issues with Amazon's Mechanical Turk API. Many parts of the API were undocumented, and there were some parts of the API (notably the Pricing object used in the createHit endpoint) that were blatantly wrong as to both what they wanted, and what they did. We spent about 9 hours just on trying to figure out that one endpoint. Amazon's error system also contributed heavily to our difficulties. Instead of returning the actual error encountered, which would have led to an immediate correction on our part, Amazon returns 1 of 2 generic error messages regardless of the error that actually occurred, even if it knows what error occurred. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully got the original functionality planned done, as well as some of the stretch goals. Not only do we have a working API but a fully functional user management system with built in billing. This is not just a hack, but well on it's way to being a real business.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SurveySays</h2>\n<p>We're going to finish out the stretch goals we did for the user area as well as some add-on features, and then we'll be moving toward being an actual business.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wordpress\">wordpress</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://surveysays.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://surveysays.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>surveysays.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did a lot of concept planning in the beginning stages as well as research on similar services and trends in the Mechanical Turk ecosystem to flesh out the pricing.

Because Arduino boards requires some knowledge in coding, it was a \"kill 2 birds with 1 stone\" kind of thing where I'm finally working with Arduino boards and I'm learning how to code them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Basically, it just prints a line on the lcd screen that says \"Swamphacks!\", and has moving blocks on the bottom line that look like eyes moving left and right. The lcd also lights up in a cool green color, and there are buttons that turn on  a buzzing sound and turn off the sound. It's pretty basic.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Very carefully, and persistently. I basically started with a Arduino Uno board, and thought about what I can do from there. At first, I was going to do some sort of reflex game, but I ran into a few problems, so I thought about changing the way a reflex game works, but I also came to a few more problems due to the limits of Arduino. So in the last few hours of hacking, I decided to go basic and fundamental with Arduino. This way, I'm learning how to code and use Arduino efficiently, and there wouldn't be any complications in finishing my little project. Thus, the Arduino Basic Toy was made. However, I couldn't do it all myself, I had a few help from random people and lots of help from a mentor, whose first name was Brett.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As I have mentioned before, there were a few changes in my project's direction. For one thing, I have never coded with Arduino's before and I'm not very well experienced with programming at the moment. As for the directions of my project that led to what it is right now, the changes were made because of Arduino's limits such as having to move a character on the lcd screen and it's refresh rate to make it move must be the same for all characters across the screen. The initial idea was that make a 2 player reflex games and it required the black blocks to move at different rates. Unfortunately, it seemed virtually impossible to happen with modules and boards provided. At some point, I changed the idea to something basic and the least challenging task I had to accomplish was to make sure the Arduino toy was working the way I wanted to and testing it to make sure the coding was good enough to where there wouldn't be any errors or crashes.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Learning how to code Arduinos. Getting my hands on Arduinos. Successfully completing a project. Attending Swamphacks on my very first semester, and having the feelings where I solved problems by myself.  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to code Arduinos.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Arduino Basic Toy</h2>\n<p>There really isn't a defined direction or sequel of Arduino Basic Toy. I basically created a project for myself where I have a goal and I have fun learning and playing around with my project. If there were to be a sequel to my project, it would depend on what modules I have, what Arduino board I would use, and what ideas I have to make it a reality.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["s16_swamphacks", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It uses pictures to find hotspots around town</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for s16_swamphacks</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Lionex/s16_swamphacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Lionex/s16_swamphacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I set up the build system and taught lots of things to people.", "Worked on html and CSS in Atom.", "I worked on the Google heatmap API, added coordinates, and stylistic elements.

I wanted to try my hand at creating my own audio visual production. The results were...less than spectacular.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a linear, 3D graphic based, audio synced production.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>In order to avoid working with native libraries, I used Three.JS (WebGL) for rendering and GNU Rocket for keyframing and music syncing.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>GNU Rocket was harder to setup on OSX than it needed to be. I lost hours on this. Additionally, the JS connector interface was poorly documented and if used wrong wouldn't allow you to sync with the rocket track view. Also, JavaScript for OpenGL is quite terrible for some workloads (many objects) due to JavaScript's single threaded model. On native, this overhead would be much lower and I would have more control over the rendering pipeline. More control wasn't the point though, as I have never even started a good production due to the native OpenGL overhead / boilerplate. Overall, getting <em>something</em> to work was an amazing accomplishment given my graphical inexperience.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I finally got GNU Rocket running for the first time in my life and made a <em>teaser</em> production. I was using a song without per-channel information, so I had to <strong>manually</strong> keyframe every interesting event, along with the camera. Needless to say, I couldn't keyframe everything.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Manual keyframing is hard, but thankfully GNU Rocket makes it feasible. Three.JS has major performance limitations involving GridHelper.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Outer Realm</h2>\n<p>I hope to add more keyframes and more effects to bring this \"demo\" out of the '90s.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: I CLAIM NO RIGHTS TO \"Electromagnetic Blaze - Magnetic Midnight\".

Little did they know about the parking situation at campus!! They missed a some classes because of this. On the other hand, other two team members do not have a car. Coming to campus on weird timings is a daily struggle for them! What if these people can actually go together, in one car, save some bucks, meet each other, save fuel, prevent global warming, save universe!! Carpool is the answer!! </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>So versityPOOL is a cool web application which is a platform where students of different universities(with .edu IDs) can freely register as potential drivers or riders and find people from their own school and/or major as travel companions. No one wants a long ride to be boring. This application gives you a chance to find people with similar interests in your neighbourhood.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>A bit of node.js, a bit of HTML (with css and jQuery of course), sprinkled with some fancy Ajax calls and BOOM!!\nversityPOOL GUYS!!!</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Countless!! We literally started setting up the environment after coming here. With 0 programming experience in node.js, we ran into a hell lot of difficulties!! But thankfully, we were able to build this app... Or at least some part of it!!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>One of a kind application with a unique idea! Come on, A user friendly carpool app with neat UI which lets you find people having similar interests!! What more do you want!! Free candies!?</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>Pretty much everything!! Guys working on front end were using bootstrap for the first time. Guys working on the back end used node.js and mongodb for the first time!! And it was a LOT OF STRUGGLE!! REAL STRUGGLE!! But we all learned a lot, apart from technical stuff, a lot team work stuff. </p>\n<h2>What's next for versityPOOL</h2>\n<p>Probably one android app first!! We were on it, but ran out of time. And probably more features to add like filters to search people. And one of the most important features, a messaging app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Urvik08/versityPOOL\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Urvik08/versityPOOL\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["LazyTag", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to share pictures anonymously with people but we're too lazy to go through the effort of tagging the picture as is common practice in this day and age.

Ari is experienced in 3D web audio and wanted to implement 3D audio for a game. Caitlin is a UI/UX designer for games, and immediately thought of combining the motion sensor Leap. </p>\n<p>The game narrative was first a blind ninja, then an underground mole, but the team settled on the <strong>dark web</strong> a spooky place all the hackers could really relate to. Kyle, Matthew, and Paula jumped on board shortly after and killed it on implementation. None of the team members had experience in Unreal or Leap Motion prior to the event. </p>\n<p>And the team lived happily ever after. </p>\n<h2>Significance of Game</h2>\n<p>Game Designers use the same verbs in most games to approach problems. You have an enemy, you hit it, kick it, or jump on it. Using hardware like the Leap allows designers to explore new verbs like reaching or cherry picking to solve the same problems. </p>\n<p>The idea of Ariliphe was to deprive the user of the most dominant sense, sight. Allowing the user to explore the sense of touch and heightened sound. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Kyle and Matthew worked out the major mechanics in Unreal engine using a community plugin for Leap. <a href=\"https://developer.leapmotion.com/documentation/unreal/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">More info about the plugin used.</a></p>\n<p>We used Unreal 4.10.2, and Leap v2.3.1. </p>\n<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>\n<p>Learning Curve!\nOne of the greatest challenges was the learning curve using Unreal and Leap for the first time. Leap does lacks a large community for support, making it a tricky hardware to get off the ground. </p>\n<p>Kyle and Ari discovered a better way to implement the 3D audio!\nSince the Leap motion is limited to tracking hand movements, moving a character in 3D space was very challenging without overwhelming the user in controls. The boys innovated a last minute level design that replaced the former by moving the objects on a rotating wheel in 3D space to give the user the best 3D audio experience. </p>\n<p>Collision with Leap Motion Mesh Plugin!\nPaula and Matt spent the wee hours of the morning working on the end Boss fight (against the Trojans) for the game. For our team collision with the Mesh provided by the Leap Plugin used proved to be difficult and inaccurate. They are still working on a solution to make it more accurate and functional. </p>\n<p>UX Design\nCaitlin has designed simulations with VR, but Leap was an entirely new challenge. She spent time researching UX for Leap and quickly realized that Leap motions limited controls actually constrained the player just as much as traditional controllers. The team brain stormed to design challenges that used simple and easily learned motions to help with this design problem. </p>\n<p>OBTAINING A LEAP!\nIn fact, one of the Leap controllers overheated and died during the Hack (don't worry not your Leap's MLH). Thankfully to our delight Leap controllers were available to check out at the event. </p>\n<h2>Levels</h2>\n<p>Text Level: \nThe game drops you into a world with a 2D RPG style text adventure. This level was included to establish the overall narrative and characters. </p>\n<p>Sandbox Level:\nAs designers we assumed that the end user will have little interaction with Leap before playing this game. So the first level introduces the user to open hand controls in a 3D space. </p>\n<p>Training Level: \nAllow the user to recognize audio cues and corresponding actions. Since the Sandbox level introduced the user to the motion controls, this level focuses on teaching the player how to carefully listen to 3D audio without visual feedback. </p>\n<p>Pinpad Level: \nThis is a puzzle designed to allow users to auditorially and spatially solve a puzzle. It uses a sequence of sounds that the user must repeat to continue to the next level. </p>\n<p>Boss Level: \nWe wanted to really explore the power in 3D audio, so the boss fight is held with the user completely blinded. The user has the ability to listen and swipe for defense. </p>\n<p>Unique mechanic: \nHeartbeat health: Since there is no GUI, the health is relayed in the form of a audio heartbeat.</p>\n<h2>Special Thanks</h2>\n<p>Big thanks to the Major League Hacking for lending us 4 Leap motions to use during the event!\nThanks for all the love and support Swamphacks team. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unreal-engine\">unreal-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-audio</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Flappy Bird in Swift", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flappy Bird in Swift \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/338/196/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flappy Bird in Swift \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/338/197/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>I wanted to learn how to make a game for ios so I decided to follow some tutorial to help me make a game </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sprite-kit\">sprite-kit</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["DynamicCity", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>DynamicCity</h1>\n<p>Change the appearance of advancement or ruin of a city in response to user brain activity.</p>\n<p>Most of my time was spent exploring different frameworks that I might be able to leverage for such a feat.

Always pinching pennies here and there to just barely afford the minimum amount of sustenance needed to get you through the week. With such tight constraints, forgetting that you left meat in the refrigerator for a week or accidentally buying another bottle of olive oil is a painful mistake. That's where the idea of Mnemosyne came from.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mnemosyne allows the user to enter their bought groceries into a database containing items in their fridge, pantry, and freezer. Mnemosyne streamlines this process by allowing users to either scan the barcode on their food item to retrieve information on  the product, or take a picture of the item for products without barcodes, such as fruits. These items are added to the users virtual refrigerator. While an item is added to the virtual refrigerator, Mnemosyne searches for an estimate of the expiration date for that item and stores the information alongside it. This allows users to track items expiration dates as well so they can plan meals accordingly. In the refrigerator screen, users can remove, set 'out of stock', or 'resupply' items. When an item is set to 'out of stock', it is automatically added to the shopping list screen, which the user can then open up next time they're at the store and can't remember what he/she has at home. Once the user has purchased the item, they can set the item back to supplied and the item will be removed from the shopping list and added into the refrigerator. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built Mnemosyne with java in Eclipse with the android development plugin.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges I ran into was parsing scraped website information, consistently and robustly. Retrieving product information from barcodes and using search engines proved easy, however, retrieving expiration dates of food items is still achieved by scraping websites for information..</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of the robustness of the app and the integration of Clarifai's image recognition API. I am also proud that I can take this idea further than this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to build projects with Maven. More about android app development. Android intents. Clarifai.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mnemosyne</h2>\n<p>Next up for Mnemosyne is adding a recipe suggester which gives users advice on what to cook based off food in their refrigerator that is expiring soon as well as a sorting option for different dietary constraints. I would also like to add a background application to send users a notice of upcoming expiring food. I believe Mnemosyne can help save thousands of dollars of wasted food people throw out because they forgot what was at the back of their fridge.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">barcode</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">picture</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/janbro/RefrigeratorTracker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/janbro/RefrigeratorTracker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["$quad", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>ggg</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>ii</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for $quad</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.gatech.edu/mdutta7/SwampHacks/tree/altDemo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.gatech.edu/mdutta7/SwampHacks/tree/altDemo\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.gatech.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked with receipt recognition API and Firebase for back-end.", "", "", ""]], ["Eventr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I couldn't really find an app similar to it.

These journals are intended to be more than just a grade; they're meant to be a keepsake, too, which is why its too bad that so many of the entries were rushed in order to meet a deadline. Another keepsake that had been diminished was our passports. Many countries have begun to exchange the passport stamp system for landing slips (Hong Kong included), which in a lot of ways strips travelers of a timeless badge of honor.  Seeing an opportunity to right these wrongs, we set out to develop Pathway.</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Pathway is a mobile application which tracks your travels via the location data saved in your smartphone's pictures and develops a timeline of your day. Each location is then given its own heading in a journal page alongside some of the pictures you took. Essentially, Pathway outlines your day for you, so you can spend more time embracing the world and less time jotting it all down. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The concept was sketched out and iterated upon in Precursor in the early phase of Pathway's development. The concept map was built later in atomic.io in order to get a sense of how the UI felt to use. Two versions of the application were then attempted: one built in Swift, and another in React Native. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It turns out that there wasn't enough experience in mobile app development between the three of us to make use of Xcode and Swift. Late into the night, an attempt at a workaround was made and a new version of the app was started in React Native; our intention was to make use of the framework's Javascript underpinnings (a language we are more comfortable with) to speed up the development process after falling behind due to Swift. Unfortunately, this did not occur.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>A lot of teams packed their bags and gave up as the night grew on; despite our struggles and frustrations, we stuck it out until the end. Even though we didn't have a functioning mobile app, we did develop a strong concept piece that is an excellent representation of what we intended to create.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned first hand how important proper preparation and communication is to a successful hackathon.

Probably some six pack abs. But most importantly some inspiration to eat healthy. So, we thought let's build an app which will motivate us to get back in shape and stay fit. Competition has always been a factor of motivation, so we thought how about we create a small competition between your friends for the race of being the fittest. So, we brainstormed our pea-sized brains and came up with Foodifai. The rest they say is history.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's an app, which helps you stay in shape by allowing you yo take a picture of your food, and depending on it's nutritional value, assigns some points to you. There are also groups, where you can compete with your friends and family, to gain the top spot. The more unhealthy food you eat, the more points you lose. It's also equipped with a cool trash talk feature, which intimidates you, when you try to eat unhealthy food.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a native Android app, which uses Clarifai APIs for image tagging. We've also used Parse to implement the Login and Register functionality along with the storing the data for leaderboard and groups.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A lot of them. We ran into an issue where we were not able call Clarifai's API, because of some incorrect Exception logging. Initially we ran into some problems connecting the application to Parse. This was happening because we had incorrectly initialized Parse. Then we ran into some issues regarding setting the Read and Write settings of the ACL settings, after we overcame those we were good with Parse.</p>\n<p>Apart from the issues faced above, one of the biggest concern was data analysis, which in turn came up as a major challenge, however, we were able to overcome the same to a large extent. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The App. period.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>-Connecting Parse &amp; Clarifai APIs with android. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Foodifai</h2>\n<p>-Currently we have mocked nutrition data, however, we look forward to connecting the application to more authentic nutrition data from sources like NSDA API, Food API etc.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rahulbobhate/Foodifai\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rahulbobhate/Foodifai\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Analysed tags received from Clarifai and assembled back-end data.\nUsed Android and Git for the first time.

This algorithm takes out the manual labor usually involved in looking and registering for classes, and allows the student to view possible schedule configurations to fit his or her semester best.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The hack consists of three parts: the first one is a web application where you can sign in and select your classes with your preferences (like selecting a specific professor, a specific time, or leave options without preference); this information is sent through a POST request to our localhost server; the second part of the hack, is a couple (or more) classes and databases that run the input, create the possible schedules according to the university\u2019s course data, and produces an output; the third part of the hack, displays the possible schedules in an android phone.  The phone supports a smooth calendar interface that also allows the user to sign-in and create or view a registration session.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble trying to develop the algorithm to organize and schedule classes.  Getting the data proved not too difficult, but finding an efficient algorithm to compare each class for conflicting schedules is challenging.  Eventually, our team found a solution and implemented it into our program.\nCommunicating with multiple devices through the network proved much more difficult than initially realized.  For example, POST requests often failed unexpectedly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The backend of the app effectively runs the schedule organizing algorithm. The user can choose what course preference he or she has. If no preference is selected, all courses of the same name will be considered for the schedule generation.</p>\n<p>The Web UI for the main page turned out to look fantastic.  The background displays a cool blue gradient which is much easier on the eyes than existing course registration software, and links to class registration and available classes are simple to use.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>HTML/CSS, Java, Android, and backend development.

Combine it with small day to day earnings and you have Commune. My inspiration comes from how wasteful it is for multiple people to go to the grocery store for the same items, or be sitting at home while 2 doors away a neighbor has to hire an expensive babysitter. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Commune brings the power of the community to you. Ask for favors free of charge or pay a little for a job like painting your house. Hire some kids to mow your lawn. Get someone in the neighborhood to help you out with that math topic you've been having trouble with.</p>\n<p>Commune uses locational mapping to give you  things you can help out with in your own neighborhood. You can be a good samaritan and even earn a little on the side.</p>\n<p>Commune is designed to be a completely USER-DRIVEN community platform, hence there will be little to no external verification of identities by an external team. People will vouch for others who helped them out with a task and raise the credentials of the helpers.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The interface is entirely built in Unity3D, while the back end is created in PHP using an SQL server. For the purposes of a demo, there is no live back-end available so some random data has also been generated to simulate the experience.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Building the whole project alone was a difficult task, so I created most of the front end and part of the back-end for it. Designing an efficient way to sort locations in your database is part of the issue.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>A whole lot about PHP and SQL server implementation. Quite a bit about the Unity3D UI!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Commune</h2>\n<p>Further tweaks, optimization and UI improvements. A better search filter as well as a messaging/chat tool in order for people to communicate easily will be next on the list of additions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4h3m8QIinncTHJzRjBndEZ4a2M\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4h3m8QIinncTHJzRjBndEZ4a2M\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Did everything.", "worked on the design, php and sql parts to implement the database in order to access  data.

One example smart outlet without remote capability was made with arduinos, rf transceivers, and a precision amplifier. An outlet and relays were bought from Home Depot along with standard power wires and a couple low value power resistors to mimic a real outlet. This allowed us to revolutionize how people typically think about power without completely overhauling the system. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Wifi was impossible on all fronts to connect to; I looked through _ every _ detail of the data sheets and forums on spark core and edison, and nothing. There were <strong>no</strong> commonplace hardware tools like wire strippers, screwdrivers, and soldering irons/solder. Luckily I brought my own soldering iron/solder, and I used my pocket knife to cut through 14 gauge solid copper wire. At some point I realized we didn't actually have a solid plan for power measurement and had to think of some way to do it without frying our arduinos.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The solution to power measurement I came up with was to build a three-stage precision isolation amplifier from my spare circuits class parts. I've never impressed myself more. I'm also really proud of my teammate, who is writing code for the network of outlets right now. He came up with how it works on his own and made it so that the product also has industry applications. In large areas where outlets are spaced too far to reach a main data collection node, they'll propagate the information cleanly throughout the network until it reaches its intended location when the data is cleared elsewhere. The mix of expertise and determination between us really made this project an amazing experience.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned how to interface and configure spark core and intel edison really well. If they worked, they would've been my favorite thing to use because I really enjoyed it until connection failed.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Lit</h2>\n<p>Ryan and I will continue to optimize the design for Lit and try to build a company out of our product. After this hackathon, we realized just how feasible and useful something like Lit can be for people. It would be a shame not to expand on the capabilities and broader values of this project into the making of a smart home.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rf-transceivers</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">relays</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on the distributed node data transmission/communication protocol, developed the packet structure for commands, integrated the rf transmitters/receivers and relays with the arduinos", ""]], ["Identifeye", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>We used the trained neural network provided by Clarifai to determine semantically meaningful descriptions of images and videos on the screen.
