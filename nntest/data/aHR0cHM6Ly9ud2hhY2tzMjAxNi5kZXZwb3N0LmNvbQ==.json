As such, we need decentralized systems to allow the normal citizen to exercise their right to individual expression. One of the most important of these is corruption-free voting systems, which allow legislation to move in the direction of public opinion. </p>\n<p>We believe that technology like bitcoin and Ethereum are integral to reestablishing integrity in government and organizations and bring about a new wave of 21st century democracy.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>One of our guiding philosophies was to make blockchain technologies available to non-tech literate individuals. We believe the future of Ethereum depends on abstracting away technical details, while being transparent and open.

The creator also supplies our system with the ether to run our system on the Ethereum network. When each voter votes, their vote is sent through the Ethereum blockchain. We attach a hash of their email address and the person/issue they voted for to their vote.

Alan was the organizer for the Simon Fraser Gaming Commitee; as a na\u00efve youth he just wanted to connect people and enjoy a nice weekend inside playing video games together \u2014 but all he found was logistical nightmares, frustrated friends, and a deep, burning desire to right these injustices.</p>\n<p>Clapp, the Competitive LAN App, is the answer to Alan's woes; developed with his long-time friend and colleague Alexei Alexeivich Popov the Second (most commonly referred to as <em>Alex</em>) \u2014 together they are <em>NumBits</em>. The two set out to build something that would answer the majority of LAN competitors' questions within no more than 2 taps on a screen. At the same time, Alan saw that despite its simplicity, the app should never put a ceiling on what a creative organizer could put together. The app was to walk a fine line between clarity for users, and power for admins and organizers. </p>\n<p>The back-end was designed by our two heroes in conjunction: Alan's extensive knowledge of Scala, Play and Postgres made rapid iteration easy, which allowed Alex to map out schemas that were flexible, highly normalized, and easy to work with both front- and back-end.</p>\n<p>The design of the app was to be nerd-friendly and light: Clapp's signature dark blue (nickname <em>Flawed Azure</em>) was a choice that took several hours of guesstimating hex colour-codes to discover, combining the dark themes of many a code-editor and the crisp contrast it provides on white. Elegant, large type in the San Francisco typeface is used widely in the app, with several derivatives of <em>Flawed Azure</em> being used to visually separate more important information. </p>\n<p>By now you might be wondering \"why <em>Flawed Azure</em>?\". Well, to be completely honest with you, dear Reader, it's because Azure is Flawed. The first hurdle Alan and Alex had to overcome was that of lacking documentation, external ports, internal ports, and other things that sound like they belong on submarines. The two put their heads together and wept, as help from Microsoft did not save the day. At our heroes' darkest moment, a light went on somewhere in the dark, and using a little <code>ifconfig</code> magic the two formed a connection between Clapp and Server, without using Azure at all. </p>\n<p>But the night was dark and full of terrors as each developer fought the demons of his respective platform. Swift's type-safety made working with JSON tedious and error-prone, but Alex pushed on. Through the fire and flames Alan carried Clapp, as conflagrations erupted on server cores with every new constraint and business requirement. And finally, seven hours after the setting of the sun, they reached the calm \u2014 the eye of the storm, if you will \u2014 wherein smooth sailing was restored, and the two young men, as if mad, broke out into fits of laughter over the conversations they heard around them. It was each developer for themselves, in that overly-lit room, and as sleep-deprivation-induced babel made its way through the campus #OH and #nwhacks2016 made their way through the interwebs.</p>\n<p>The two did not sleep; but neither did they see the sun rise. The last day of their journey together was dark and grey, and their agile fingers did not type quite as quickly as they once had. Cognitive load and sore necks took over. Alex briefly nodded off and face-desked, waking up several other people in the room.

Recently with academic, social, and personal stress, she has relapsed back into depression. In fear of the social stigmatism of mental illnesses, she does not know whom to talk to about this and has not revealed this to anyone. She is currently fighting the battle alone.\nLate night, when her depression gets the worst of her, she just needs someone to talk to at that moment. \nWith our app Out of My Mind, she can reach out to anyone anonymously and chat with someone who shares a similar experience and understands exactly how she feels. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A peer-to-peer platform for those who are mentally ill or who simply need an outlet to help resolve their most current worries-- to get their worries out of their minds.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used NodeJS, Bootstrap, Socket.io, and JavaScript as our back end, and HTML and CSS as our front end. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The learning curve was quite steep as this was a new language for all members of the team. For some, it was also the first time using Git. Hence, the starting of the app of deciding what to do and how to do it, and the wrapping up with merge conflicts in Git were both difficult to complete and overcome. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of complete minimal viable product as beginners without any previous experience. We are also proud and excited that this could potentially make a significant impact to society, by resolving a common issue we see happening, even to the people around us. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned to program and connect back end services NodeJS, Bootstrap, Socket.io, and JavaScript to front end services of HTML and CSS. We learned how to work as a team in terms of communication, workflow, and Git.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Out of my Mind</h2>\n<p>For our vision and additional features: \n     -to turn our web app into an android/ios mobile app to serve a wider audience\n     -to create a database of users' personal experiences and how they may or may not overcome it\n     -to provide data to mental wellness organizations by keeping track of common topics among users \n     -to continue connections between users by allowing them to create accounts and be able to save chat history\n     -to expand the

With some portions of the population feeling concerned about safety in the area they live, the idea for creating an application to help users travel more safely would be a great way to give back. This would not only benefit our community, but can be easily applied to other cities as well.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>GetThereSafe maps the best route to your destination by determining where the most amount of light sources are.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Utilizing a Google Maps API, we built a PostgreSQL database that stores light source data from the Open Data Catalogue from the City of Victoria. When the Flask web app receives the start and destination locations, it calls upon our database to determine which route has the highest amount of light sources. It then returns the best routes for the user to use.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p><strong>Database Implementation</strong>:\nOur main challenge was creating a database (to store light source data) that could easily communicate with our app, which was being deployed via Heroku. The first attempt was to host our database with Orchestrate, but after determining that it would have taken far too much time to implement, it was decided that the team should change services.</p>\n<p>On the advice of Artur from MLH, he suggested to spin up an Amazon Web Service that would host our database. Creating an EC2 instance running PostgreSQL inside, the database finally began to take form. However, we began to notice that there were going to be permission issues with our web app communicating with our EC2 instance.</p>\n<p>An attempt to make a pg_dump into an RDS instance was made, but after three different database implementation attempts and much research, it was decided that we would implement our database via Heroku's PostgreSQL add-on (which utilizes AWS in the background, but in a limited manner in comparison to our previous attempts).</p>\n<p>We were hoping to utilize cloud services to make our data set easily scalable, with the goal of being able to add more information to make our user's route as safe as possible.

Thinking about this, we thought it would be a great tool to have reminders on things we needed built into our desktop to run at any time any place (without WiFi too). From this, we also remembered how much we both worked on computers everyday for our academic studies and decided to create one great solution to help us, thus came into existence our final idea to build a reminder system for break times for people who work.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project is a unique reminder system for those who work. We present our users with options for choosing the kind of alert that the user will get and options to set a time interval. We have two main features where the user can either be alerted with a default text notification, or can begin their break with a random video from Youtube that automatically launches. We wanted the user to experience a new way of learning to balance life and work, and promote healthier working habits for each individual.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team consists of two people, each of whom have different skill sets. We worked to create an aesthetically pleasing interface married with a straightforward, functional implementation. \nFor the design, we worked to create a clean and minimal layout that promoted a sense of playfulness while maintaining maturity. The colour palette leans towards a dark but powerfully accented theme, suiting a broad range of audiences in personality and age.\nFor the software, we chose to code in C# using the Windows Forms library, since it allows for graphical user interfaces and we could develop with these tools quickly. The program switches between two modes while running: it uses a gui when getting the setting and alerting the user, and then acts as a system tray program while the timers are waiting. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Major challenges we had were mostly around the limitations of Windows forms. The library does not support nice looking image scaling, so we ended up exporting our graphics many times in order to get them to look and act perfectly within the window. We also found that Windows forms does not have very good support for system tray icons, so we spent most of you debugging time getting that to work well. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're really proud of how our different abilities were able to work together well. The work was essentially devided between design and implementation, and we were pleasantly surprise to see it come together nicely. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>For the designer member of the team, the new things were using Visual Studio,  image technologies, Git and Github, and working in a new social environment consisting of programmers rather than designers.\nFor the programmer of the team, new things were using C#, the Windows Forms library, graphics programming and making a program based on another persons design. </p>\n<h2>What's next for AWe BREAK</h2>\n<p>We may take this project further by making it for more platforms. We can see it being convenient as a web-app or browser extension, or as a mobile app. We would also add more kinds of alert notifications, as a larger variety could give further incentive for people to reliably take breaks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">windows-forms</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thomasnakagawa/AWeBREAK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/thomasnakagawa/AWeBREAK\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Did the programming and debugging to implement the great design and graphics that Karen Lim worked on!", "Worked on the design interface of this project but still learned much in coding aspects with and from  Thomas Nakagawa!"]], ["ExtraFacts", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Google advertising was directed.

Navigate to different locations using the Myo armband.</strong></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a github repo that connects the Oculus Rift to Google Map Street View's API using Three.js and WebVR. We then combined it with another github repo that connect the Myo with Google Map's Street View. While it sounds like a lot of Bootstrapping, we found ourselves having to write tons of code because the two repos used different methods for rendering the 360 effect on Oculus and the math behind it was intense.</p>\n<p>Links the github repos we used:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/troffmo5/OculusStreetView/tree/master/js\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/troffmo5/OculusStreetView/tree/master/js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theQuazz/myo-street-view\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/theQuazz/myo-street-view</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Combining the two repos together was what we spent the whole hackthon doing. The biggest issue was that we had to rewrite most of the Myo Street View repo code because it used a different form of implementation of Street View. Also, due to the lack of documentation of both repos, it was very hard trying to understand the complex calculations that were used to render the depth effect of the Street View. On top of that, configuring the Myo to the code was troublesome in itself.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to render Google Street View on Oculus using a 360 rendering algorithm that is compatible with the Myo rendering algorithm.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Everything about Oculus Rift SDK, Myo API, Three.js, WebVR, and combining two repos that were built very differently from each other despite their similar application.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Explorly</h2>\n<p>Implement the finalized Myo movement functionality and landmark-based wikipedia overlays.</p>\n<p><strong>=============</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong>\nThe demo link must be run on the <a href=\"https://nightly.mozilla.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firefox Nightly browser</a>!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-streetview\">google-streetview</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webvr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://cedricith.com/explorly/landing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://cedricith.com/explorly/landing.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>cedricith.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Myo interface, though this wasn't completed in time.

Just think about that when our wearables could understand us and help us input the command into computers and that totally got us started this project.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Multiple users with Myo Armbands can collaborate on the same remote white board and combine result could be displayed at the same time in different location.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>At first, we build a simple web application that prints the frames of data captured from Myo using the MyoJS framework, later we decided to implement a backend server that its job is to manage, delegate and synchronize the Myo data stream coming from our Myo Web Client, we have used <strong>Microsoft Azure</strong> to host the server and it worked really well. We are able to achieve maximum throughput of 600 eps (events per second). Because we have broken the barrier that 1 myo control one computer, we are able to use multiple Myo data streams to control the same canvas on a remote computer running our blackboard demo software. The rest of the time we have invested in debugging the application, increase its stability and creating tools that help us mange the 3 Myos we have borrowed. We have created a very simple iOS/Android application using <strong>Ionic frameworks</strong> that shows the data stream of all Myos on the server and its EMG graph. We also made a connection counter using <strong>Beaglebone</strong>, it has a 7-segment display will show how many Myos is currently connected.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>It's not easy to get meaningful data from the Myo Armband SDK. </li>\n<li>Data are sent to a centralized server which could be limited by internet condition</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Myo could only connect to one computer via Bluetooth but we broke the barrier that we could use Myo to send command across the globe</li>\n<li>We have successfully came up with a demo to show that it's possible to interact with others on the same digital workspace without using the traditional computer input (keyboard/mouse).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There are still works to do to optimize the data collection</li>\n<li>Myo need to improve the SDK to be more developer friendly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Wasabi Myo</h2>\n<p>If we had more time, we would love to take this project to the next level, by enabling gesture controls and simple collaboration software, the current Wasabi Myo is a proof-of-concept project that we have spent a lot of time to create, so there are still a lot of features planned for Wasabi Myo.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pm2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Wrighte", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/157054690?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0#t=\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wrighte \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/356/663/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Front page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wrighte \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/356/664/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Post page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Often, people are afraid to post their opinions in the Internet because their words are attached to an identity.

From there, the information is bundled into a QR Code which recruiters can quickly and easily scan. Recruiters can also add additional comments such as \"This student is looking for a Fall 2016 internship\" to each scanned candidate. Recruiters can then review all the Candidates scanned and view them in a list.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The APIs for saving candidate information, authentication, authorization, are all built using Node.js.

Users set start and end times where items must be within the sensor's range. If registered items are outside the sensor's range between the given times, an alarm goes off, pushing you to achieve a healthier balance. This solution can also be applied for item security, allowing users to be notified when valuables are removed from their place unknowingly. </p>\n<p>The vision of 5pectrum is to encourage better habits towards technology and awareness of personal belongings.

No, now the spectrum is broader. Whether we like it or not, the <strong>online world</strong> is as definitive of who you are as the physical one. This begs the question... How do we garner popularity online?  The answer: <strong>#Hashtags.</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h1>HashTagGenerator creates hashtags based on user input and images. By analyzing the image and the input text itself, the app generates a range of hashtags, from the hilarious to the serious and everything in between. The app also searches twitter for usages of the hashtag, allowing you to chose unique tags that represent your content, or see what's trending on the social media platform.</h1>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The app is built using Java which runs python scripts using process builder in java. It integrates the twitter api to search for hashtags in twitter, imagga for image tagging/recognition, and imgur to upload our own photos for image processing. We built a swing app to have a nice UI for the java program that reads user input and selects relevant keyword. We then generate random, relevant and mostly hilarious hashtags for the user to use. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A lot of these technologies were very new to us also so we spent a lot of time learning new technologies. Another problem we had was that we were hitting the twitter search limit for our user account and couldn't really figure out how to use an app authentication for more api calls. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud to say that our hashtag keywords are generated perfectly. Although we got weird suggestions sometimes, it is because we don't have machine learning or anything of that sort.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that we needed more preparation going in to a hackathon. We learned a lot about our limitations as a team also, and how to overcome the limitations by approaching in a different angle.</p>\n<h2>What's next for #HashTagGenerator</h2>\n<p>Mobile or chrome integration.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by a <strong>social problem</strong> that a place to live is more than just a place to stay away from the rain, cold, heat. It is a place to enjoy life in. A location where places nearby are what you enjoy such as sushi restaurants, coffee shops, rock climbing, music stores, parks and many more. A place to live should be chosen on what you have value in either its the home, price, activities and shops around, or the nature around it and with in our app, we try to bring that information to you.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our website uses a database filled with homes that are available to purchase for the location you want to look into. Along with displaying the information of the location and price of these homes, it also locates the nearest shops and recreational areas around that location. And with a database that we have created ourselves, the user is able to post their own estates for rent or for sale. We have also built a mobile app that gives information on the area you're thinking of living such as the weather, the quality of life and the various homes available in that city that you are interested in.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the website using a PHP framework called Laravel using mysql to query the database. Using calls to the foursquare and google map api we were able to integrate a way to locate shops, recreational areas, and activities that you could do around the location of where you are willing to purchase. In our mobile android app, we built it using android studio whilst using the openweather api to grab the weather conditions, the teleport api to find the quality of life and calls to our database to grab the available houses that are for sale/rent all within the city of your choosing. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into challenges with implementing an azure database within our project as it kept coming up with errors. And having not been in touch with android studio some members of the team had to relearn how to use android studio to get decent workflow going. Finding apis to use for our idea and using them took up most of our time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of not only being able to make a website but also a mobile android app that serves the our main purpose of giving you the information to find the perfect place for you. Proud of using multiple apis to integrate various data to allow the user to better influence their choices in order to make the right decision.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that apis are useful tools to implement into one's apps because not only does it do a lot of hard work already in the background, it is also easy to get the data you need with just a simple rest call. We learned that managing our tasks small enough fasten our workflow and helping each other was the key to success.</p>\n<h2>What's next for LiveInLife</h2>\n<p>What's next with liveinlife is a way to get real estate / renting data so you don't need to populate ourselves. Using the foursquare, teleport and openweathermap api to further give more valuable data that can be used to further give you the perfect place you've been always dreaming of. Also, the design for the app would also be polished to suit a more modern, simple look and further testing to get rid of the many bugs that are still within both the website and android app.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a

pc windows, mac, android, ios devices etc...) that enables users to fetch 3D content from other users and project them easily with their device using the Unity3d compiled app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Basically, we had 3 major components.</p>\n<p>1) Building the physical plastic component to create the projection above the device</p>\n<p>2) Unity Component - contained all the linear algebra and graphics algorithms to dissect the 3D model streamed into Unity and split it up into 4 projections that when put onto the device, these projections are used to recreate the 3D model anywhere any time</p>\n<p>-made the UI controls to manage all the Transformations to the image such as rotation speed and scaling the Hologram size</p>\n<p>3) web app in the MEAN stack to upload, preview in WebGl and share 3D content to other users</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CD plastic too thick to cut</li>\n<li><p>Using take out trays plastic which had the fruits and vegetables to facilitate the projection using the phone wasn't completely reliable.</p></li>\n<li><p>Streaming assets from outside of Unity into the project.</p></li>\n<li><p>Building the projection

The idea behind this app was to create a real-life side-scrolling game that would emulate the user\u2019s every step which is reflected in the game. This would contribute to their overall well-being, and their progress can be shared amongst friends.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user will be able to collect coins and complete quests by defeating monsters. This is achieved by prompting the user to take photos of real life objects that allow them to expose the monster\u2019s weakness. For example, the fire dragon is defenseless against water based objects. Correct photo submissions of entities range from a variety of water based objects including water bottles, fire hydrants, and ice cubes. The Clarifai API will recognize these submissions and would then post a message on whether or not the user has successfully defeated the monster.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We utilized Microsoft Azure to set up the database for our leaderboard and host the page that displays the game leaderboard. The Android app was built using Cordova and various plugins. We also used the Clarifai API to recognize objects from images taken to fight monsters. The entire application was written mainly in Javascript and a little bit of Java.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a lot of difficulty trying to accurately detect the user\u2019s movement via the accelerometer functionality on our phones. There wasn\u2019t a reliable way to interpret the type of movement based solely on the accelerometer data due to noise generated by gravity that affected the readings. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We've implemented an algorithm that detects user movements through the use of the accelerometer, as well as Google location services to reliably predict when the user is walking, running, or involved in some sort of physical movement. We are now also able to successfully detect any image that the user takes using their phone\u2019s camera and match it to the keywords associated with each monster the user encounters within the game.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt how to utilize the Clarifai API to detect images and match them to specific keywords that we wanted. We also learnt how to use Microsoft Azure to host our leaderboard server.</p>\n<h2>What's next for FitFrog</h2>\n<p>We hope to integrate more active movements within the game such as jumps and leaps (pun intended). We also want to create more interesting quests that would involve different monsters to defeat. In addition to these, we hope to make the leaderboard more personalized to the user by connecting it to their Facebook page. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intellij-idea\">intellij-idea</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phonegap\">phonegap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ameliayap/FitFrog\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ameliayap/FitFrog\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Bounce", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bounce \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/356/736/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Taking a look at a post.

The game could be played in one setting with all the players together, or over a longer period of time, </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Players set up a game with a pre-picked image category. The game then goes through multiple rounds; in each one, one player is a judge (the position rotates through the players), and the rest of the players submit a caption to a randomly selected image from the selected category. After all captions are submitted, the judge picks their favourite, and the player with that caption gets a point, and the game moves on to the next round. After a certain amount of time, or when one player gets a certain amount of points, the game is over.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built the website with a bootstrap template and our own custom CSS and JavaScript. We used the Python Flask framework as the backend server to store data about the game, which communicates with our HTML and JavaScript in order to load content onto the webpage when a round loads. We also used Microsoft's Bing Search API in order to search for images and load them for each round.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Trying to find enough team members to work on each part of the project. Jack and Emerson worked mostly separately on each part of the project, and there were some logistical issues and issues in communication when trying to merge each of these parts at the end.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Developing a nice looking user interface with minimal reliance on pre-written CSS and JavaScript libraries, being able to coordinate use of several separate systems in order to get a mostly functional final project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned much more about making interactive webpages, such as using an external API (Bing Search API) to load content onto the page, and using JavaScript separate from another backend (Python Flask framework) to handle different parts of the app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Recaptions</h2>\n<p>Currently the game is missing the judging feature, which could be added by keeping track of a rotating judge, and excluding that player from the caption submissions on the round that they are the judge. Also, the game currently functions by manipulating a single webpage, which if used in one setting would function similar to a desktop or mobile app. If players use the app from separate locations, they would need to all modify the same webpage rather than each player submit their own part for the game. As an extension, Recaptions would have each user connected to the server, and each user would only need to submit their own part for the game (i.e. the judge would only see the judging screen, each player would only see their caption input box), possibly with a login system. This would allow the game to be more usable when not all users were playing at the same time.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/emersonn/impressions\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/emersonn/impressions\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["ClipIt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ClipIt \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/356/781/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>That's all.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Ember.

It seemed like no matter the group of people, planning an event was always\ncumbersome and there were too many little factors that made it annoying.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PlanIt allows for quick and easy construction of events. It uses Facebook and Googleplus\u2019\nAPIs in order to connect people. A host chooses a date and invites people; once invited,\neveryone can contribute with ideas for places, which in turn, creates a list of potential\nevents that are set to a vote.</p>\n<p>The host then looks at the results and chooses an overall main event. This main event\nbecomes the spotlight for many features introduced by PlanIt. Some of the main features\nare quite simple in its idea: Let people know when you are on the way, thereby causing\nthe app to track your location and instead of telling everyone your location, it lets\neverybody know how far away you are from the desired destination. Another feature is the\ncarpool tab; people can volunteer to carpool and list their vehicle capacity, people can\nsort themselves as a sub\u00adpart of the driver. There are many more features that are in\nplay.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Microsoft Azure for cloud based server side development and Xamarin in order\nto have easy cross-\u00adplatform compatibility with C# as our main language.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some of the challenges that we ran into were based around back\u00adend and server side\nissues. We spent 3 hours trying to fix one bug and even then it still seemed to be\nconflicted. All in all the front\u00adend went by quite smoothly but the back\u00adend took some\nwork.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were very close to quitting late into the night but we were able to take a break and\nrally around a new project model in order to finish as much of it as we could. Not quitting\nwas probably the most notable accomplishment of the event.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We used two new softwares for this app. Xaramin and Microsoft Azure. We also learned\nthat its possible to have a semi working product with only one day of work.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PlanIt</h2>\n<p>We were hoping to fully complete PlanIt for use within our own group of friends. If it gets\npositive feedback then we could see ourselves releasing this app on the market.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xamarin\">xamarin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">valve</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.suhdud.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.suhdud.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.suhdud.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Farzadd/PlanIt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Farzadd/PlanIt\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the server solution powered by Azure, database design and implementation, and client back-end.", "Back-end developer for the project.

One issue that I faced with Ask.fm was that I couldn't ask follow up questions. Another issue was that things were too public so I thought I couldn't be honest enough with someone. Don't get me wrong, I know Ask.fm is a Q/A app but back home my friends and I mostly used it for confessions. So I thought of learning from those few things and creating something of my own. That's what I call Confessions. (Honest confession by the way - I don't claim to have magically stumbled upon this idea; it was a carefully thought out process). </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It lets you start a conversation with anyone (someone who has a Confessions ID of course) by going to their profile and making a confession (or just writing a private anonymous message). It automatically shows up on the person's home page (Confessions home page) when they log in. You can also follow up on those confessions and basically have a conversation going with the person you either confessed to or received a confession from. It could be your friend, relative or family member, doesn't matter. The interesting thing is that even during these conversations, the person who confessed remains anonymous unless he/she gives off his/her identity.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built the back end using SailsJS (with its Waterline ORM) on a MongoDB database. I made these choices because I personally love JavaScript but I haven't worked much with NodeJS on any large scale project, so I thought I might as well try. Another reason is that I want to make the solution realtime by incorporation Sockets (couldn't do that yet for the time shortage) and enhance the user experience. On the front end I used AngularJS to build a completely independent front end (i.e. the front end is NOT served by the back end; rather it communicates with the back end using a RESTful JSON API). For authentication I used PassportJS and a bunch of other tools to make the back end a stand-alone OAuth 2.0 server, so all requests are properly authorized before they are served. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Time was a big issue. I couldn't complete the realtime features that I REALLY wanted to. Given it's my first time building a whole app (both back and front end) using AngularJS and SailsJS, it was slightly expected but I wanted to prove myself wrong. Regardless, I loved the overall experience. Also, it was a bit difficult finding useful resources for SailsJS because the community isn't as active (and old) as other platforms I have worked with. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I finished my app!!! I have a working prototype of my idea that basically does all of what I intended to build but just not as well as I'd want. Regardless, I think I can showcase my idea using a working product and for me that's a big achievement. I participated alone and coded for 21 hours straight (I kept a log of my commits and made sure I have them on bitbucket so I can look back at them and remind myself of this hackathon in the future), which was a great experience by itself.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>SailsJS, SailsJS, SailsJS and Waterline... And of course to communicate with others!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Confessions</h2>\n<p>I want to start my own startup with this app. I believe in the idea, so maybe I'll launch it publicly once I can incorporate all that I want for the app. You might see it coming out soon! ;)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sails-js\">sails.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://162.243.207.216:8000/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://162.243.207.216:8000/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>162.243.207.216</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/taaus/confessionsapp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/taaus/confessionsapp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on both the front and back ends of this app."]], ["Mixr", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mixr \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/357/042/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mixr \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/357/043/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Mixr is inspired by art, music, and collaboration.

With decreasing security in mobile phones, we decided it was time to build ourselves some protection.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our mobile application takes an image, video, or audio recording and uses stenography to encrypt a message into the byte code of the given file. Once a file has been encrypted you chose how you chose how you send it (i.e. Facebook, email, Twitter). Once received the recipient can use our app to decrypt the file.

To create the encryption we broke down the byte code of a file and by studying the data structure we were able to alter the least significant bits to have our encoded message without juristically changing the file. This is very advantageous for privacy as it is just an image being sent over a common medium such as Facebook. Unless specifically told that an image was encrypted they would not be able to tell that there was a secret message travelling through in plain site. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We originally started working with jpeg format however this was difficult due to the header and footer in the byte code of the file.
