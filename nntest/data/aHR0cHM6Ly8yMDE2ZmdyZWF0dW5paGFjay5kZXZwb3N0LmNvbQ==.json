We have used Amazon AWS to host our Node.js server (because node.js is the best dev language out there #jokesFromThePast #MLHSpring2015). We utilized Google Maps API for Android to show the user's current location and the events. </p>\n<h2>What's next for StudentMag.net</h2>\n<p>Tap Tap Technology startup. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spejss/StudentMag.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/spejss/StudentMag.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Android app's UIs design and development.", "", ""]], ["VSpace", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VSpace \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/544/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The Web UI</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VSpace \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/554/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing Page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The idea arose at the Great Uni Hackathon 2016. The challenge announced by Noma was to create a solution to the following problem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How do we help a potential occupier understand size and available space options in a building without physically \ntaking them there?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We began with the end user in mind. Who would actually be using this product?</p>\n<p>The operator is going to be the agencies trying to let the spaces in the buildings. The user would be anyone interested in occupying the building. We do not make assumptions about the technical abilities of either of these users. Hence we needed to devise something which was intuitive to use, but not too difficult to set up. Virtual reality is one option, as it allows the potential occupier to 'walk' around the office, and get a real feel for the size.</p>\n<p>We couldn't use an Oculus Rift. Here's why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It requires a computer with exceptional graphics ability</li>\n<li>It requires someone with technical knowledge to set up</li>\n<li>It is relatively expensive</li>\n<li>The wires can be very cumbersome</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We decided to go instead with the Google Cardboard:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It uses a phone. Most people in business have a phone capable of creating VR scenes.</li>\n<li>The setup is minimal. You launch an app and the experience is setup</li>\n<li>Google Cardboard costs \u00a35 -- A more comfortable Homido costs \u00a350.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There are two parts to the system, the website, and the mobile application.</p>\n<h3>The Website</h3>\n<p>The Website is for use by the operator - the building space retailer. It provides a very simple interface which allows the user to draw out the scene, and then see a very basic visualisation of how the scene might look in three dimensions. It provides options for visualising the scene, clearing any mistakes, and sending the data over to the mobile application.</p>\n<h3>The Application</h3>\n<p>The mobile application was built for Android, and allowed the display to be configured for Virtual Reality. With simplicity in mind, the user only needs to launch the app, request the data from the website with a simple click, then put the phone in the headset to have a look around.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h3>The Website</h3>\n<p>The website was developed with the standard suite of web languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the CSS, we used <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bootstrap</a> to ensure that there was a consistent style guide, and to make the webpage pseudo-responsive. For the 3D modelling and display, we used <a href=\"https://threejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">three.js</a> to provide a JavaScript wrapper for OpenGL. We also used <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">jQuery</a> to send AJAX requests to build the API.</p>\n<p>We took the following approach to building the website:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Design and create the layout</li>\n<li>Have the 3D visualisation work for a fake input matrix</li>\n<li>Create a grid matrix to feed into the visualisation</li>\n<li>Create the API which can then be read by the mobile application</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>The Application</h3>\n<p>The application was build with Unity, which provides tools to create Virtual Reality scenes. The application connected to the API and downloaded a matrix representing the geometry of the space. It then goes through the matrix and procedurally generates the space. The user is then able to move around the scene by using the phone's gyrometer, and by performing different actions.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deserialising JSON in Unity</li>\n<li>Setting up the Unity development environment</li>\n<li>Demoing what would be seen by the person using VR. Manchester Metropolitan university blocked port 8888 meaning that screen mirroring from phone to laptop was made impossible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>For two of the four team members, this was their first Hackathon</li>\n<li>Nobody in the team knew how to work with unity or Virtual Reality before the project started</li>\n<li>We managed to create everything that we had planned for</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unity and developing for virtual reality</li>\n<li>Git and Collaborative Programming (including Pair Programming)</li>\n<li>How to create an API between a website and an application</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for VSpace</h2>\n<p>Who knows? :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/VirtualVirtuoso/vspace\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/VirtualVirtuoso/vspace\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was responsible for leading the team and building the website part of the application.", "", "", ""]], ["Wimphony", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rOts4kH9KbU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wimphony \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/598/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Wimphony</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We have all had thoughts of what it would be like to travel within the internet. Wimphony, a combination of the words wifi and symphony, is an application that can bring us one step closer to that dream.</p>\n<p>In reality we just wanted to build something cool and representing wi-fi signals sounded like it fit the bill. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Wimphony takes an Android phone and uses the built in wi-fi antenna to scan for networks around and their signal strength. It then generates a piece of music for each wi-fi network and places them in a virtual world at a location relative to their real world position. You can then explore this virtual world using a Google cardboard, with spacial perception of the sounds and by extension the wi-fi networks.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We divided the building of the app into an Android component, music generation, back-end plumbing and VR. The music generation and back-end plumbing were done in Python with Flask sitting on top of it. The VR component was written using Unity and C#.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We chose this project explicitly because we would all be working in areas that we were not really comfortable in. This meant that we ran into our fair share of problems along the way, but also that we learnt a bunch whilst doing so.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Actually getting music generated from a wi-fi network was a big moment for us, as was placing this sound into the virtual world as a point source. More importantly however, every member of the team pushed themselves to learn many new things.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>Getting the app fully integrated so that there was end-to-end data flow would be the next step. After that, the codebase would need to be secured if it was to sit on the public internet for any time whatsoever. We could also improve and diversify the music generation algorithm, for example including different genres of music or using different instrument synthesisers/polyphonic tunes. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/officialgupta/wimphony\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/officialgupta/wimphony\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android app and acted as resident Python/C# consultant.

I thought I'd really like one but there was no way I could afford a professional one, so what other option did I have but to make my own?! After recently seeing a talk about the Web Audio API at a conference, I really wanted to try it out, so I thought I would!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using an iRig (or some other device/cable) you plug your guitar into your phone and open up the 'play' page of amp in a browser. Then open the 'listen' page on another device and you'll be able to hear the amplified guitar playing - no wires between the two!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>It uses the Web Audio API to get the input from the guitar, which effectively acts like a microphone when plugged into the phone. It then uses Socket.io-p2p to stream the audio via WebRTC to the 'listen' page. The Node.js server is there only to serve the static pages and to facilitate the handshaking of the p2p WebRTC connection between the 'play' and 'listen' pages.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The Web Audio API is still under active development (read: everybody is still arguing about how it should work), and so is WebRTC. Having previously used Socket.io many times, I thought it would be a good idea to use their p2p module to stream the audio. In the end it worked out okay, but the documentation was a bit rubbish.</p>\n<p>Another <em>major</em> issue is the latency. When running the 'play' and 'listen' clients on the same machine, the latency is manageable, but over the network it's too much to be able to play guitar. This does somewhat invalidate this entire hack, but please ignore that fact.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I managed to get Socket.io-p2p working, something that as far as I can work out, not that many people have done. It ended up being a great wrapper for WebRTC, but the documentation really needs work. I've started on making an example of how to do media streaming over it, which I plan to submit a pull request for as this is something totally undocumented as of right now.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>WebRTC is pretty cool, and definitely something to look out for in the future. Same goes for the Web Audio API. Good documentation is also crazy important (but definitely already knew this).</p>\n<h2>What's next for amp</h2>\n<p>I'd really like to look into adding some traditional-style guitar effects (distortion, etc). Reducing the latency is probably top of the list for now though. Not entirely sure how I can do that!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webrtc\">webrtc</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">web-audio-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">guitar</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sprusr/amp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sprusr/amp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I spoke with the computer, and the computer listened to me"]], ["tobeeornottobee", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Aston Hack had their animal themed hack last week and we decided to carry on the theme with bees</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a game where you play as a bee</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>we used Unity to build the game </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>we didn't have anyone who could do 3D modelling so had to make assets without experience and had to learn a lot of Unity syntax to be able to achieve our aims</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>10/10 flower modelling, working game in 3D </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Unity3D, some 3D modelling </p>\n<h2>What's next for tobeeornottobee</h2>\n<p>online multiplayer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iphil011/tobeeornottobee\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/iphil011/tobeeornottobee\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["RoomSimulator2016", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We got our inspiration for building a room from the visualising techniques used in virtual reality games.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It creates a walkable 3D room based on the dimensions provided by the user and allows him to place different objects in it for size reference.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Unity-SDK.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating the room based on the custom inputs of the user.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Writing our first 3D-Application.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Using Unity to create simple 3D-Applications.</p>\n<h2>What's next for RoomSimulator2016</h2>\n<p>It would be fun to add a wider range of objects and apply physics to them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I suggested the idea and wrote the application.", "I looked up how to make the menu and provided ideas for it, learned how to build walls and different objects and tried to run the simulation through Unity Remote but was unsuccessful as I don't have a pretty good android device."]], ["CSSocUK", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Katie run's the Computing Society at Salford University.

We could also see our API and algorithm being used on online forums and comment sections to minimize potential harassment and hate speech.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZidHuss/HarrasBlock-server\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ZidHuss/HarrasBlock-server\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ZidHuss/HarrasBlock-chrome-extension\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ZidHuss/HarrasBlock-chrome-extension\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front-end, came up with the idea, did the mockups and helped work on the overall concept and goals we wanted the browser extension to achieve.", "", ""]], ["Nana's herbs", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Trine style coop game</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>2.5D  Platform game with 2 characters with different skillsets</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Nana's herbs</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Jump Leads", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dVWmNkkvosg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jump Leads \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/442/011/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We saw a problem with how investor networking is done, we think we can streamline the process and even add a fun element to it.

Our team thought that the task of working with virtual reality, modelling and innovation  was the most suitable so we built upon it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The hack itself is basically set to innovate the way people buy real estate: instead of going to every single location by foot or car, the customer would have the ability to meet with an agent or just view the estate from home with any VR headset. But our project does not just stop there - the main goal is to not only be able to view the rooms, but to actually customize them yourself! You could add any furniture you desire just to have a better feel on how a specific property tailors to your needs! In addition to that, the engine would work in such a way that you only need to implement the type of housing you need (office, flat, etc.), the amount of occupants and the system will automatically generate a room with certain types of furniture in it in a specific formation. The last thing to be implemented would be a machine learning algorithm that actually learns from customers needs and makes better assumptions as to what type of house to offer!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The project was build by using a simple piece of hardware and a few pieces of software, that being the the famous Samsung VR gear, 3D modeling software BLENDER and last but certainly not least, the Unreal Engine for the actual mapping of items and surroundings. We decided to use the Unreal engine as it has a really friendly user interface called \"blueprint\" that actually helps minimize the amount of low level code and move building blocks of the program into a more high level environment.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>During our development path we have encountered quite a few hurdles: the largest of them being the massive struggle with the Oculus rift. The main issue with the rift was that we spent an actual 9 hours trying to get it to work on our laptops. We went to the extent of trying a campus computer to no avail.

We were\nalso very excited to work with Alexa following our previous failed attempts with\nother hardware such as the Sigfox board and Estimote - after attempting to make\na device-based hide-and-seek game to no avail, we continued to explore ideas\ninvolving different types of games, including a reaction-based buzzer game,\nbut the idea of a text-based game in Alexa quickly won it for us.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Alexa offers one text-based adventure game dictated between you and your Amazon Echo device, based on our experiences at GreatUniHack 2016, albeit with a little more gruesome death from lack of self-care...if you don't play it right.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Initially we experimented with some Bluetooth, GPS and NFC devices with ideas such as a hide-and-seek game and access control for the workplace with some helpful widgets. However, hardware failed us, and we were not able to carry out these ideas, so after a fairly speedy brainstorm we chose to rely on the Amazon Echo for text-based games. The statistics for this are viewable via a web frontend powered by jQuery and PHP, and all information is also retrievable via the Echo, which itself recognises users entered into a database on the website.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The first six and a half hours were pretty much wasted attempting to get the Estimote, Arduino and Sigfox devices to work, though after about half an hour of brainstorming we quickly cemented our next idea. A lot of challenges required close cohesion between team members, such as the implementation of PHP and databases in the otherwise-jQuery website.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I (Simon) am proud that I've managed to hold my own in what seems to be a set of far more experienced peers, and I'm glad to have both made a positive contribution that has impressed my team and even learnt a little bit for myself.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I (Simon) learned some jQuery and an interesting little plugin for it, a terminal emulator by the name of ptty. Also, since this was my first hackathon, I also picked up on some tips and put into practice a few hints I'd already learned from articles, the best of which being to never stop until you feel ready to basically just pass out. Within reason, of course.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Game Master</h2>\n<p>We could update it to make it more stable (though error handling is something we're glad to say Michael implemented very late in the hackathon), and we could also devise more games for it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-dynamodb\">amazon-dynamodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BlooMaan/Dungeons-and-Hackers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BlooMaan/Dungeons-and-Hackers\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["PhotoMerge", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>great-uni-hack-2016</h1>\n<h6>Making events great again.</h6>\n<h6>Making Android great again.</h6>\n<h6>Making Xiaomi great again.</h6>\n<h3>Short description</h3>\n<p>A web and mobile application that helps people at events put all their pictures together. </p>\n<h3>Motivation</h3>\n<p>People take lots of photos at events, and then forget to share them.
