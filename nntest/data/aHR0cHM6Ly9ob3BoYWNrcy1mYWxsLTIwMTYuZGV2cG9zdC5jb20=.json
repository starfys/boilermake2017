We want more people to try out coding from a young age, but it's tedious for a kid to sift through syntax on a terminal. We decided to create a user friendly, drag and drop framework through which beginners can program a remote controlled car. Children will be able to learn the important fundamentals behind the activity in a way that best resonates with their imaginations.</p>\n<p>The android app has a drag-and-drop interface where the user must arrange conditional and flow code for the RC car to execute a certain task. When the correct code has been put together, the car will proceed to move in the desired manner. There are levels that teach a progression of concepts, from simple commands to nested for loops.</p>\n<p>We took apart an RC car and rigged an Arduino circuit. The motor and servo are powered by a series of batteries through an h-bridge which is controlled by an Arduino 101. The Arduino has a bluetooth module that receives commands from the Android application. </p>\n<p>The bluetooth was incredibly challenging, both to set up physically and to interpret, as it sent data through a convoluted series of bytes. The hardware likewise required an immense amount of precision with respect to the soddering of the batteries and the testing of the motor's capacities. On the software end, we needed to learn and implement a new GUI framework that fulfilled our objective of being agreeable to children, while also maintaining sufficient technical depth.</p>\n<p>The car's circuitry was essentially built from scratch. We're proud of that technical accomplishment - but we're also happy, on a more strategic level, that this product opens new ideas with respect to early education, one of the most crucial driving forces of our modern society.</p>\n<p>In addition to learning about the software and hardware involved in the project, we were exposed to a variety of organizational and conceptual obstacles that stood in-between us and our product, which required the integration of various hardware and software components.</p>\n<p>We are going to add a greater level of customomizability to our levels, on top of a log-in system. The car itself could also use optimizations in longetivity and safety. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zackkhan/RCCarCodingHack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zackkhan/RCCarCodingHack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the car's circuitry, where we wired an Arduino to the RC car's built-in servo and drive motor through an H-bridge, and installed a bluetooth module.

When travelling, it can be very difficult to 'merge' with local culture and do simple things like order a meal. We wanted to build something that would eliminate these language barriers and would allow any single person to build a relationship with someone from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Koala allows two users to choose their respective languages and then take turns speaking. As each user speaks, the application translates the spoken word from the first user's language into text of the second user's language. This text is then displayed on the screen. Once it is the second user's turn to speak, the application works similarly and outputs the translated text to another part of the screen. This makes communication quick and easy between two completely foreign parties.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Koala was built using a node.js server. The html front-end of the application accepts user interactions as well as speech input. The front-end converts the raw speech data to text in the original language by means of the Google's Cloud Speech API. This text is then sent to the node server where it is translated using the Google Translate API. Finally, the translated text is returned to the user end and displayed on screen. Socket.io is employed to maintain consistent communication between the front-end and the node server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We faced many challenges in making sure the application was listening for and translating to the correct language at the right time. Getting all of the components to communicate with one another, specifically, implementing the Socket, was very difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of setting up the node server and creating a web application which accurately listens for and translates speech.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to build node servers and use the Socket.io framework to send and receive data.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Koala - A Real-Time Conversation Translator</h2>\n<p>Further polishing could turn Koala into a hosted web application or mobile application which will make travelling to foreign countries easier than ever before.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/thewilliamyao/Koala\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/thewilliamyao/Koala\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Helped in establishing server communication with socket and user interface design.", "Developed full stack of the nodejs server and established sockets between google and local server for streaming audio to translation.

Binge drinking, in addition to its long term neurological nephrotoxic effects, has been associated with higher rates of sexual assault and rape. About 90% of the alcohol consumed by those under the age of 21 is in the form of binge drinks, causing an estimated 1,800 deaths and 696,000 assaults every year, of which nearly one hundred-thousand are sexual., \nTogether, binge drinking costs our economy an estimated $191 billion dollars per year in lost productivity, increased hospital visits, and greater crime rates.\nYet in spite of overwhelming evidence linking binge drinking to adverse health and societal effects, few technology based solutions exist to combat college binge drinking and its downstream effects. We developed TrustFall to fight for the millions of college students plagued by binge drinking every year. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application provides an easy to use platform for college students to notify emergency contacts in case of binge-drinking related problems, including sexual assault. In addition, our platform enables emergency contacts and campus security personnel to locate the user in case of binge drinking related problems. \nOur application works via the following steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Users set an expected return time and safe locations (ie. dorm, house, etc) before going out to drink or party.</li>\n<li>TrustFall sends an alert to \u201ccheck in\u201d on the user at the expected return time. </li>\n<li>The user can answer TrustFall by saying: a) \u201cYes! I\u2019m having fun!\u201d,b) \u201cHelp! Notify my friends!\u201d c) \u201cRequest an Uber\u201d d) \u201cCall campus security.\u201d</li>\n<li>If the user answers \u201cYes, I\u2019m having fun.\u201d, TrustFall will check in again after 1 hour. </li>\n<li>If the user  answers \u201cNo! Notify my friends!\u201d, Trustfall will immediately send a message to Sarah\u2019s emergency contacts with Sarah\u2019s current location and a prewritten help message requiring her friends to reply. Using the user\u2019s location, the user\u2019s friends will try to find her and bring her home to safety. Once the user is home or at a preselected safe location the Trustfall software will automatically notify the user\u2019s emergency contacts of his or her safety and exit. </li>\n<li>However, if all of Sarah\u2019s emergency contacts fail to respond within 15 minutes, Trustfall will enter Stage 3 and send Campus Security a message with Sarah\u2019s current location and unresponsive status.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>React-native was used to build the front-end and handle push notification for TrustFall. Using socket.io to transfer the SMS data to node.js backend hosted on Amazon Web Service (AWS), twilio was used to send a text message to the recipients on the emergency contact list. Lot of date components were handled using moment.js. 900 lines of javascript code were written to make TrustFall come to life.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Technical challenges - it was most difficult to implement Twilio API into react-native. Since react-native does not run on server, I had to work around the client using socket.io. By hosting an Instance on AWS EC2, we were able to create a server that operates Twilio to send user location to other people through SMS.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of designing a near complete Beta version of our application. We are particularly proud of creating a practical solution that can potentially help many students in real-life; there are many sexual harassment incidents that go unnoticed. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that this issue was more prevalent than we thought it was. The seriousness of the issue became the motivation for us to really be in other people's shoes and think about a practical solution. </p>\n<h2>What's next for TrustFall</h2>\n<p>Next we hope to begin reaching out to universities in order to license our application. We also hope to increase the funcationality of TrustFall to be applicable to young professionals. We also hope to partner with Uber and local police departments in order to provide better support in cases of emergency. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/moment-js\">moment.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Innovator of TrustFall,\nFull-stack Developer,\nVideo Editing", "", "", ""]], ["AlexaUX", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4N4KhzO0qe0?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AlexaUX \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/430/986/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AlexaUX \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/430/935/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>AlexaUX</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><strong>AlexaUX is the idea which would be future of the Human Computer interaction</strong>. The computer can possibly do many things but it is just limited to few features and mode of communicating with computer only through Mouse and keyboard. This could make computer to do all the task just on the voice and gives you required work with good feedback. For us, importance is not only work done but how fast, easy it is done without any additional hard work.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>AlexaUX is currently deployed to build the web Site with Voice command using Amazon Echo. It is beginner stage but this could be used to teach the student how HTML and CSS works. It is easy, user-friendly and can be easily operated by the kid. It uses the Amazon Echo to listen to the user then work according to voice command like \"Mr. Robot, please create a grid\". It will show the real-time grid created on the Webpage. you need not worry about the HMTL and CSS stuff, AlexaUX takes care of it. All the user has to do is to concentrate on the design of the website. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Built AlexaUX mainly out of Angular 2. We used firebase for our database. Alexa will talk to a lambda function that we set up using AWS. It will then contact the firebase and make the necessary changes depending on the voice input. Our front end will then listen for any short of changes and grab that value that changed.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Adding 1 or 2 feature is taking too much time but dynamic style coding both HTML and CSS for more than 2 features was challenging. But this challenge has created scope for various other features which are going to add in the future.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We have broken the boundaries of the Amazon Echo by building a platform. The platform is used to control and create the webpage. We think it is game changer idea and we have simple Idea \"Everyone has the opportunity to create their Website just by using Voice Commands\". it's our motive \"everyone can create website no programming is needed\", it should be as easy as preparing the coffee.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We came in as a booty css user to a professional graphic designer lol. Learning animations, transformation, etc was weird at first.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AlexaUX</h2>\n<p>we are going to integrate it in various fields like Medicine, Space Research and other fields. The AlexaUX will not only create advance, bootstrap, responsive and 100% working website within few minutes. It will also deploy the website on the servers by automatically configuring the servers parameters by just voice command. It will be used in the medical field where the doctor asks for something it will scan all the documents, database, previous records and other stuff related to it. Display the result with just one and only question. We are also thinking to add the artificial intelligence and machine learning to it in the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angular2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lambda-functions</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ionic2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Created the Front end using Angular 2 and Ionic 2 for the mobile.

Through marketing research of piano learners in different regions around the world we obtained the following estimates: while the European piano players are declining, the increasingly dominant user markets are in the US and China. The former has an estimate of over 20 million piano players, and the latter has a piano-learning frenzy rapidly taking over 40 million children alone - that's more than the current Canadian population (The American Association of Piano Teaching?; BBC news)! In addition, there are around 15 million youth or adults striving to make a living in a piano-teaching career (..). \nHowever, although there is a plethora of released products related to mastering this particular instrument, most focus on providing visual or auditory tutorials. For instance, the app created by a professor here at the Peabody Institute of Music of the Johns Hopkins University is positively reviewed for its advantage of providing sight reading training. Another app named Piano 3D has been rated a 4.5/5 by 6937 ratings in the Apple App Store for its game-like exercises combining auditory and visual support. The lack of training in tactile sense in piano learning - i.e. the sense of touch - inspired us to create a product specifically geared towards training of fingering, rhythm and musical expression. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We designed a glove with sensors at the tip of each finger wrapping. When a user plays on the keyboard with the gloves, the sensors would send tactile information (pressure signals) to our database. There are two ways of using the database. The first is to apply a big-data strategy and customize lessons based on the tactile sensation data uploaded.\nThe other is to use a VR glove and play back the stored tactile sensations of any piece onto the users fingertips such that they learn the amount of pressure best to apply to the keyboard.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used soft piezo-electric sensors and a latex glove to make a prototype of glove to record the tactile sense. The prototype is built with an Arduino and a breadboard. As the fingertip pressure is applied to each sensor, the Arduino reads the voltage value acting on the sensor, which is then transferred to the value of pressure. The pressure distribution of every finger is uploaded into our database for future reference. \nFor a demo of replaying the tactile sensation, we used an Arduino to manipulate solenoids to apply a force on the fingertips.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Holding and gauging of the pressure sensors; designing the wiring of the components; reading data from the Arduino port and importing to a file; measuring data using the prototype glove on a real grand piano while shooting high-quality videos simultaneously; writing an algorithm to match the pressure signals for the actual piece of music recorded; 3-D printing the shell of the workstation for the solenoids; activating the solenoid according to the pressure signals desired.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We did a thorough marketing research and customer discovery, and tested the idea by conducting 40 interviews. We made a working prototype for the measuring glove and used it while playing a J. S. Bach French Suite.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TouchArt</h2>\n<p>We look forward to passing the I-corps program for customer discovery.\nWe will update the prototype with thinner and softer sensors to build a glove that will interfere less and less with playing.\nWe will collect data from pianists and students using a working sensor glove.\nWe will develop the algorithm for analyzing the tactile sensation from different users and return advice on the way to improve playing.\nWe will continue to develop the actuator and build a replaying glove that could potentially reproduce the pressure signals back onto the fingers of users.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Opportunity Cost Calculator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Over 60% of Americans have less than $1000 in their savings account and thought of making a project that could allow people to understand that investing can be easy, powerful, and convenient.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The code is meant to take in banking information of an individual using the Capital One API and calculate the opportunity cost for different types of investment strategies.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using HTML, CSS, and PHP.

Even though I'm not antisocial, and even though it was a busy night at the library, I didn't know anyone there. I could have easily made friends by standing up on the closest table and screaming about your math HW, but I knew that there is must be an easier method to find people who I can study with. That's how I had the idea for hivemind.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>hivemind is an app for college students, where they can easily find study groups that are currently happening on campus. After getting on the app, students pick out the classes that they are taking at the university. On the main screen on the app, different color pins start popping up, every pin representing a different study group and every color a different subject. We made it so that the pins are tied down to the building, not to the group's exact location. By pressing on the pins, you can get all the emails of the same study group and ask them about where the group is location, or where we can meet-up to study. You can also make my own study group if there isn't any group for my subject close by. By joining and making study groups, you earn \"honey\" which is the point system for this app. With the leadership board on the app, ranking people based on the amount of honey they have, you can see who is most involved in working with others.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We went through a discussion beforehand about what we wanted the app to be. We organized a google doc with all the necessary API calls we would need on the backend. So primarily, planning beforehand helped us a ton with what we wanted to do: there was less discussion of the product and more doing.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Setting up the server was certainly one of the most time-consuming issues. We wanted to use DigitalOcean to run our program, but unfortunately, their initial image of Django was 1.6.1, and none of the team members knew much about how the migrations system worked there. We tried to update it, delete it entirely, and even start with an empty server, but we couldn't figure anything out to work. At the end of the day, we ran the project on two computers, one on the localhost for Django, and the other for the PhoneGap programming.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This was one of the first couple of hackathons for all of our team members, and it also was the first hackathons where we were able to produce a product by the end. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to work in a group with people knowledgeable in other things, nginx, gunicorn</p>\n<h2>What's next for hivemind</h2>\n<p>This idea has a huge amount of potential. First off, it is necessary to migrate this to an actual server, that way everyone can access it. Second, we wanted to have an in-app chat system to accommodate for the talking of groups. After that, we would create a way for other campuses, other than JHU, to input their courses and buildings to bring this app to their own campus.

Specifically, sentiment and emotion analysis were features we felt would be useful for our original purpose of identifying aggressive and nasty tweets to curb cyber-bullying.  That led us to develop a very interesting statistical technique whose applications we were interested in exploring.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>At it's core, our hack is a statistical method for developing a profile corresponding to human produced text.  It employs techniques from linear algebra to analyze N-dimensional Euclidean spaces containing vectors of text attributes.  In this specific application, our hack allows a Google Chrome user to select a hotel or travel review and identify if it is fake.  Specifically the user can right click on the text of a review, where that text is passed into our python scripts using flask.  Chrome subsequently opens a new tab containing the text and whether or not the review is likely fraudulent. \nInterestingly, this was not the original focus of the method we developed. Initially, we wanted to characterize tweets as aggressive or passive by pulling data from notably aggressive twitter accounts, in order to address issues related to online harassment. However, this application proved to be far from ideal, since the text analysis on the short strings from tweets that often contained links to images was often unsatisfactory or unreliable. Consequently, we decided to look for other large sets of data that could be used to build statistical profiles. We stumbled upon text files from a Cornell researcher that contained paid-for (fraudulent) travel reviews and real travel reviews, sorted into positive and negative. After loading these data files into the script, we found that the system was able to successfully identify fraudulent reviews, which was surprising given the fact that all of the reviews were written by people, and we sometimes had a hard time distinguishing fraudulent from real by hand.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This back-end of this hack was built in python.  Utilizing the API's from IBM-Watson Bluemix, and numpy, which includes matrix operations, we implemented 6-dimensional correlation techniques on the values resulting from alchemy(python library from IBM).  These were numerical values for joy, disgust, fear, anger, sadness, and sentiment value for the text.  From these values, each review is assigned a vector with the six corresponding values for each emotion.  We trained the program by reading 100 known fake reviews and 100 known real reviews, positive and negative, for a total of 400 source reviews (data from Cornell researchers).  For each of the data sets, we created a mean vector that contained as its elements the mean of each attribute outputted from the Bluemix algorithm. </p>\n<p>To get a meaningful interpretation of the distance of a sample vector from the model vector developed from the source reviews,  we used the Mahalanobis distance.  The Mahalanobis distance is a way of analyzing the probability that a vector in N-dimensional Euclidean space belongs to a given set (in this case either a fake or real review), that relies on a covariance matrix.  Due to the computationally intensive nature of certain matrix operations, we first pre-processed the large sets of input data and produced simple binary output files that could be efficiently loaded by the python script incorporated in the front end to process text in close to real time.  </p>\n<p>In order to implement our hack on the front-end we set up an Amazon web server.  This server utilized flask, which allowed us to run python scripts on the server that we created.  It communicates with data obtained from our Chrome extension and passes it as an argument into our python function to produce an output informing the user of the probability that the selected review is fraudulent. For this particular implementation, a user simply selects a review as a block of text, right clicks, and chooses VeraCity, the name we gave to the extension. The server then produces and serves a page with the selected text and a blurb indicating whether the review was judged as fair or fraudulent, and to what extent. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One challenge we ran into was learning to use an Amazon web server for the first time.  Another challenge was using Flask for the first time. We also created our first chrome extension ever. We experienced compatibility issues between python 2 and python 3 on the web server. We had to register for Bluemix 8 times.</p>\n<p>Another major challenge we faced was deciding how to compare a sample data to the large amounts of source data we started with. We only had experience with mean and standard deviation in 1 dimension going into this project, so we had to research and leverage our knowledge of linear algebra to make things work in 6 dimensions. In this process, we also had to learn a lot about numpy to make things work in Python. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of how adaptable our statistical technique was. We think it is a testament to our attempts to understand the background of the problem we were trying to solve and the preliminary research we did into statistics that our model was able to work well for travel reviews even though we did not consider that as an application going in to this project. We're also proud of being able to get a simple web server going and getting a Chrome extension working even though we had never done anything like that in the past. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Python, web servers, and javascript, and the challenges involved in getting different parts of a project to work together. We also learned about how statistics can work in many dimensions with a lot of input data. Further, we learned about implementing interesting and powerful APIs like Bluemix into our programs. </p>\n<h2>What's next for VeraCity</h2>\n<p>This specific application is interesting, but it might not be the be-all end-all for this statistical technique, especially since the source of our data is the powerful IBM Bluemix system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">linear-algebra</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">statistics</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bfogels1/VeraCity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bfogels1/VeraCity\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["used_tp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for used_tp</h2>\n<p>so much</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dlewis777/twitter-poet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dlewis777/twitter-poet\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["The Spartan Game of Life", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Inspired by Peter H.

When viewed from the perspective of the advertising industry, this change in attention span amounts to a waste of millions of dollars of lost revenue. Advertising plays a fundamental role in the dissemination of information for nearly every corporation and the overloading of advertising has served to the determent of all companies involved. \nIn order to match with the present trends of the people,today's information spreading methods need to become more individualistic and less in the form of generic background noise the average consumer. In order to do so, we thought about improving something that everyone sees everyday, the digital billboard. Through the utility of the Watson API which is basically something which detects the type of things you're interested in based on you're appearance, age and gender in order to spread information that is relevant to individuals as well as supplementation by Google's Vision API, our billboards are able to further tailor and select advertising which is more impacful in their daily lives and thus help people gain knowledge about products they are more likely interested in. </p>\n<h2>What is Watson Advertisements</h2>\n<p>Watson Advertisement is an enhancement on the existing billboard by presenting relevant advertisements to people that are eyecatching providing a greater hit on the amount of the advertising which actually leads to an actionable result. The advertisement technique involved is using a camera which takes pictures of the area in front of the billboard at set intervals of time and uses the Watson API in order to categorize certain aspects of the visible and then change the billboard information into a relevant topic for a particular demographic. \nWatson advertisement only displays information that is relevant to the people that are standing in front of it and does not displays anything that is not relevant to the set of people around it. \nFurthermore, if a person is interested in a project, it is seen that the person looks at that particular advertisement for about 10 seconds and this billboard just need 8 seconds to know whether the person is interested or not based on whether if the person is present in the consecutive picture of the surrounding. If the person is present, then the billboard will display a video which is relevant to the image that was displayed earlier so as to slowly gather the attention of people.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>A major problem what we faced was decreasing the latency from the stream into the Watson API as the camera must take pictures at certain intervals of time while being subject to a constantly changing view. The addition of latency makes it difficult to have responsive and immediate feedback to the viewer and cuts into the already short attention span. Our solution to this problem was to create a cloud server that could give lesser latency as well as subvert a technical limitation of the Nest Cameras inability to connect to Enterprise or Captive network through a laptop wifi passthrough. </p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>In order to make this a fully refined product, we would focus on using any USB camera in order to take the input that is able to distinguish in between the objects, have minimal latency, and hence can enable the Watson API to analyse images at a really fast rate and based on that display a more responsive which is suitable based on the type of people present around it. Advertisements to be displayed also have the potential of being downloaded directly from advertising partners who can update them at their own discretion. \nThese billboards can be used in order to ensure that the company can push it's product to the consumer who are actually in need of it and the advertising done by the company becomes much more resourceful than it usually is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nest\">nest</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wifi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/karunchillz/HackRice2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/karunchillz/HackRice2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I reverse engineered the stream protocol used by the Nest camera,  which I then used to rip still frames which were then analysed by Watson ", "I helped in integrating the NEST camera with the server and worked on the algorithm in order to know which advertisement to show based on the camera input based on outputs given by the Watson and Google Vision API.", "I created the backend server which will get input from the NEST camera and output the advertisement onto billboards.
