Love circuits, but hate Java applets? Or maybe you're dying to make yourself a shiny half-adder but don't have the time (or dexterity) to fashion one out of physical components?</p>\n<h2>Inspo</h2>\n<p>Enter <em>cirkvito</em> (serk-vee-toh)! Circuits are awesome but finding good software to simulate them is hard. We chose to build a tool to provide ourselves with an alternative to clunky and overly-complex Flash or Java applets. (Appropriately, its name is a translation of the word \"circuits\" in Esperanto.) Ableson's <em>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> mentioned this idea, too. </p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>cirkvito is a drag and drop single-page-app that simulates simple circuits. You click and drag components on the page and connect them in whatever way you want and end up with something cool. Click buttons to zoom in and out, hold the space bar to pan around, and shift-click to select or delete multiple components. </p>\n<h2>Some Challenges</h2>\n<p>We built cirkvito with a lot of JavaScript by taking advantage of <em>canvas</em> and <em>jQuery</em>. We learned that UI is really hard to get right by rolling our own buttons and zoom/recenter system. </p>\n<h2>What We're Proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud that cirkvito successfully simulates not only combinational circuits like adders, but also sequential circuits with flip flops made from elementary logic gates (albeit with a manual \"clock\"). Also, we designed the data structures to represent circuit components and the way they're connected on our own.</p>\n<h2>What's Next?</h2>\n<p>A fully-responsive app that's able to resize components depending on the window size would have been nice to have. Also, being able to support custom circuits (allowing builders to \"bundle\" custom configurations of logic gates into black boxes) would make it easier to build more complex circuits.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://amecila.github.io/cirkvito\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://amecila.github.io/cirkvito\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>amecila.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/amecila/cirkvito\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/amecila/cirkvito\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["WishFor (wishfor.xyz)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WishFor (wishfor.xyz) \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/292/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A users wishlist </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WishFor (wishfor.xyz) \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/289/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our rich HTML emails</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WishFor (wishfor.xyz) \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/291/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logging in without a password!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WishFor (wishfor.xyz) \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/302/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Smart adding interface, queries prices and links as the user enters the name of the product.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WishFor (wishfor.xyz) \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/344/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Smart data population</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"WishFor (wishfor.xyz) \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/345/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Beautiful interface. </i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>Gift giving plays a significant role in society. From busy seasons like the winter holidays, to birthdays, individuals are always asked: what can I get you? Communicating these wants clearly and simply is not easy. There are lists across multiple online retailers, but beyond that there was no simple, secure, and well designed system to share wish lists with friends and family. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our platform fills this gap affording users a clean, well designed system on which they can collect their desired items and securely invite friends to view them. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>The platform is built upon a PHP and mySQL backend and driven by a responsive jQuery and AJAX front end, which we designed and coded ourselves from scratch. We took great care in crafting the design of the site to maximize its usability for our users. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some difficulties getting started with an AJAX driven frontend, but by the end of the project we had significantly improve our abilities. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>When creating this project we aimed to deploy an easy account system that was also very secure. We decided to use a passwordless system that uses uniquely generated and expiring login links to securely sign users into our system without the need of a password. This session is then maintain using browser cookies. We also were able to use live AJAX calls to smartly populate our item entry form as the user entered its name as well as pull a photo for each item.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>This hackthon our team learned a lot about web security, we had the opportunity work with a few industry professionals who gave us some great information and support.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WishFor (wishfor.xyz)</h2>\n<p>The platform will be expanded to allow further collaboration between friends in claiming and splitting the costs of items. </p>\n<h2>Functionality Demo</h2>\n<p>(dev post GIF

The largest groups are from Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia. A large percentage of the people leaving these war-torn countries apply to be refugees but sadly only a small percentage are accepted, this is because of the amount of people that can be accepted and the extensive time to get accepted to be refugee for. The processing time for refugees to come to Canada can take up to fifty-two months and multiple trips to the visa office that can be stationed countries away, interviews, and background checks. </p>\n<p>As hackers it is our moral obligation to extend our hand to provide solutions for those in need. Therefore, investing our time and resources into making RefyouFree come to reality would substantially help the lives of individuals looking to refuge or asylum. With so many individuals that are experiencing the hardship of leaving everything behind in hopes for a better future they need all the assistance they can get. Children that are brought up in war-torn countries only know of war and believe that their reason for being alive is to either run away or join the war. There is so much more to life than just war and hardships and RefYouFree will support refugees while finding a better reason for being alive. With this mobile application, there is a way for individuals to message their families, call them, find refuge, and have real-time updates of what is happen around them. </p>\n<p><strong>## What it does</strong>\nThe purpose of RefyouFree \u2013 is to provide a faster, and a more convenient resource to allow those in need to apply to countries as refugee\u2019s to start a better life. It would be end up to be a web + mobile application for iOS. </p>\n<p><strong>## How we built it</strong>\nThe iOS app was built using xCode, using Objective-C, and Swift. API's used for iOS were Sinch. For the Web app, AWS servers were used to run Ruby on Rails thats front end was written in HTML and CSS.</p>\n<p><strong>## Challenges we ran into</strong>\nChallenges that the team and I ran into was how many refugee's had access to smart phones, a computer or the internet. After a bit of research we learned that in Syria, they have 87 phones to 100 people. We are hoping that if people do not have access to these resources that they go to the immigration offices, airports, or seaports where they could apply and hopefully get to use the app.</p>\n<p><strong>## Accomplishments that I'm proud of</strong>\nGetting the code to run without an error is always an accomplishment. </p>\n<p><strong>## What I learned</strong>\nTeam work is key. Without such an amazing and dedicated team I do not believe we could have gotten so far. We come from different places, did not know each other until the hackathon but were able to put our heads together and got it to work! For the iOS developers we learned a ton about API intergration, as well as Swift. For Web Developers, they had learned a lot about server side, backend, frontend, and ruby of rails.  </p>\n<p><strong>## What's next for RefyouFree</strong>\nWorking on this project is happening right after we get out of the hackathon. We have messaged various United Nation Members along with members part of the Canadian Immigration Office to see if we would be allowed to do this idea. Although the team met this weekend, it has a high compatibility and a great work ethic to get stuff done.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sinch\">sinch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Did the research into the Refugee Crisis problem to come up with a solution, iOS Developer, Front end and Back end.

We could be underground (on the subway), flying on an airplane, or simply be living in areas where Internet access is scarce and expensive. However, so much of our work and regular lives depend on being connected to the Internet. I believe that working with others should not be affected by Internet access, especially knowing that most of our smart devices are peer-to-peer Wifi and Bluetooth capable. This inspired me to come up with Off The Grid, which allows up to 7 people to collaborate on a single canvas in real-time to share work and discuss ideas without needing to connect to Internet.

We were looking for things in life that can be improved and also existing products which are not so convenient to use. </p>\n<p>Jim was using Benjamin's phone and got the inspiration to make a dedicated two factor authentication device, since it takes a long time for someone to unlock their phone, go through the long list of applications, find the right app that gives them the two-factor auth code, which they have to type into the login page in a short period of time, as it expires in less than 30 seconds. The initial idea was rather primitive, but it got hugely improved and a lot more detailed than the initial one through the discussion. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a dedicated device with a touch screen, that provides users with their two-factor authentication keys. It uses RFID to authenticate the user, which is very simple and fast - it takes less than 2 seconds for a user to log in, and can automatically type the authentication code into your computer when you click it. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>The system is majorly Raspberry Pi-based. The R-Pi drives a 7 inch touch screen, which acts as the primary interface with the user. \nThe software for the user interface and generation of authentication keys are written in Java, using the Swing GUI framework. The clients run Linux, which is easy to debug and customize. \nSome lower level components such as the RFID reader is handled by an arduino, and the information is passed to the R-Pi through serial communication. \nSince we lost our Wifi dongle, we used 2 RF modules to communicate between the R-Pi and the computer. It is not an ideal solution as there could be interference and is not easily expandable. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We have ran into some huge problems and challenges throughout the development of the project. There are hardware challenges, as well as software ones. </p>\n<p>For example, the 7 inch display that we are using does not have an official driver for touch, so we had to go through the data sheets, and write a C program where it gets the location of the touch, and turns that into movement of the mouse pointers. </p>\n<p>Another challenge is the development of the user interface. We had to integrate all the components of the product into one single program, including the detection of RFID (especially hard since we had to use JNI for lower level access), the generation of codes, and the communication with other devices. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of ourselves for being able to write programs that can interface with the hardware. Many of the hardware pieces have very complex documentation, but we managed to read them, and understand them, and write programs that can interface with them reliably. As well, the software has many different parts, with some in C and some in Java. We were able to make everything synergize well, and work as a whole.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>To make this project, we needed to use a multitude of skills, ranging from HOTP and TOTP, to using JNI to gain control over lower levels of the system. \nBut most importantly, we learnt the practical skills of software and hardware development, and have gained valuable experience on the development of projects. </p>\n<h2>What's next for AuthFID</h2>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jimthenerd/authfid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jimthenerd/authfid\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on the interface of the client, as well as researching the algorithm used to generate the codes (TOTP)", "", ""]], ["MyoKart", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>MarioKart</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Two Myo powered bots battle for world domination, one balloon at a time.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Arduino, Myo, motors, </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Calibrating Myo movements for effective car driving movement and reliable Bluetooth interface between Myo, PC and Arduino.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The moment the vehicle correctly responded to our Myo gestures during first try....at 4am.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The team learned about new hardware such as Myo, Oculus Rift and Muse.

Pedal faster on the stationary bike to travel faster on the trail.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>The project utilizes an encoder, an Arduino Uno, a computer fan, a stationary bike, and an Oculus Rift. The encoder is used to measure the angular velocity of the stationary bike's wheel. In turn, this controls the speed of the 360-degree video played on the Oculus Rift, making it seem as if you are riding the trail faster. The encoder also controls the speed of the computer fan placed in front of your seat, so the faster you bike, the more wind you feel - just like in real life. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Just Out For a Rift</h2>\n<p>The next step for this project is to make it compatible with other exercising machines, such as rowing machines. In addition, a dedicated library of 360 degree videos optimized for the Rift would be built to allow users to personalize their exercising experience. Lastly, optional user profiles would be added so users can keep track of what trails they have finished and basic statistics such as calories burned, maximum speed reached, distance covered, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">c-sharp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on getting the video to run in Unity, co-wrote the script which determines the video speed, helped create the UI", "Came up with the idea, designed and tested the video breakdown process (movTexture vs. frame-by-frame), co-wrote the script in Unity that controls the frame rate of the video based on input from the Arduino script, and overlaid dynamic text on the video (speedometer, intro text, finish text).

We saw how difficult it was for people to find everything they wanted to know as they searched through dozens of articles and sites to get a full perspective on these trending topics. We wanted to make learning everything there is to know about trending topics effortless.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app provides varied information on trending topics aggregated from multiple news sources. Each article is automatically generated and is an aggregation of excerpts from many sources in such a way that there is as much unique information as possible. Each article also includes insights on the attitude of the writer and the political leaning of the excerpts and overall article.</p>\n<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Trending topics are found on twitter (in accordance to pre-chosen location settings).</li>\n<li>Find top 30 hits in each topic's Bing results.</li>\n<li>Parse each article to find important name entities, keywords, etc. to be included in the article.</li>\n<li>Use machine learning and our scripts to select unique excerpts and images from all articles to create a final briefing of each topic.</li>\n<li>Use machine learning to collect data on political sentiment and positivity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of this is displayed in a user-friendly web app which features the articles on trending topics and associated data visualizations.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We began with the idea of aggregating news together in order to create nice-looking efficient briefings, but we quickly became aware of the additional benefits that could be included into our project. </p>\n<p>Notably, data visualization became a core focus of ours when we realized that the Indico API was able to provide statistics on emotion and political stance. Using Charts.JS and EmojiOne, we created emoticons to indicate the general attitude towards a topic and displayed the political scattermap of each and every topic. These allow us to make very interesting finds, such as the observation that Sports articles tend to be more positive than breaking news. Indico was also able to provide us with mentioned locations, and these was subsequently plugged into the Google Places API to be verified and ultimately sent to the Wolfram API for additional insight.</p>\n<p>A recurring object of difficulty within our project was ranking, where we had to figure out what was \"better\" and what was not. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that keywords and points were scatted across all paragraphs within a news story. A challenge in itself, a solution came to our minds. If we matched each and every paragraph to each and every keyword, a graph was formed and all we needed was maximal matching! Google gods were consulted, programming rituals were done, and we finally implemented Kuhn's Max Matching algorithm to provide a concise and optimized matching of paragraphs to key points. </p>\n<p>This recurring difficulty presented itself once again in terms of image matching, where we initially had large pools (up to 50%) of our images being logos, advertisements, and general unpleasantness. While a filtering of specific key words and image sizes eliminated the bulk of our issues, the final solution came from an important observation made by one of our team members: Unrelated images generally have either empty of poorly constructed alt tags. With this in mind, we simply sorted our images and the sky cleared up for another day. </p>\n<h3>The list of technicalities:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Implemented Kuhn's Max Matching</li>\n<li>Used Python Lambda expressions for quick and easy sorting</li>\n<li>Advanced angular techniques and security filters were used to provide optimal experiences</li>\n<li>Extensive use of CSS3 transforms allowed for faster and smoother animations (CSS Transforms and notably 3D transforms 1. utilize the GPU and 2. do not cause page content rerendering)</li>\n<li>Responsive design with Bootstrap made our lives easier</li>\n<li>Ionic Framework was used to quickly and easily build our mobile applications</li>\n<li>Our Python backend script had 17 imports.

Mobile development in these countries are increasing by the second and we wanted to take part in that development.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This app allows users to get answers to a large variety of questions at almost any time. This is achieved through the use of the Twilio and Wolfram API. A user can text the application a question such as; integrate x^2, 2+4, plot(logx), what time is it, etc. Users can also ask for some dictionary definitions such as economics, ball, and H2O for example. This is all done by making a request to Wolfram and parsing the data into a readable sms or mms message. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This was built by running a server with node.js/express and having it listen for a POST request done by Twilio. The server will use the query given in the body of the text to make a request to the Wolfram API and it will then parse the data and send it back as a sms message. Depending on if there is an image it may send a mms message instead.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Twilio was a little difficult to get running, although the initial messaging was not too hard it was difficult to have a message sent back with authentication because it required many things to be setup. Parsing the data and displaying it in a proper format for the response also took some time because Wolfram can send back a lot of data that may not be relevant.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am pretty proud that we were able to get this application running because offline services is something that I've never worked with before and I always thought was pretty cool. In fact just getting Twilio to work with the server and being able to have it send pictures was pretty amazing. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Wolfram actually knows everything. The wolfram request can be amazingly broad, initially we thought we would need to tap into multiple APIs to get a broader range of data, but after further investigation we realized that Wolfram actually covers a pretty large variety of topics. I also learned a lot about the Twilio API and how to connect Twilio services with server.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AnswerMeThis</h2>\n<p>Increase the amount of data that is being sent and further improve the response speed, as well as improving visualization of the data.

Using this technology, we want to make an application that provides an educational tool to exploring how the human body works.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Currently, it uses the ServerBIT architecture to get ECG signals from a connected bitalino and draw them in an HTML file real time using javascript. In this hack, the smoothie.js library was used instead of the jQuery flot to provide smoother plotting.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built the Lubdub Club using Hugo Silva's ServerBIT architecture. From that, the ECG data was drawn using smoothie.js. A lot of work was put in to make a good and accurate ECG display, which is why smoothie was used instead of flot. Other work involved adjusting for the correct ECG units, and optimizing the scroll speed and scale of the plot.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we ran into was getting the Python API to work. There are a lot more dependencies for it than is written in the documentation, but that may be because I was using a regular Python installation on Windows. I installed WinPython to make sure most of the math libraries (pylab. numpy) were installed, and installed everything else afterwards. In addition, there is a problem with server where the TCP listening will not close properly, which caused a lot of trouble in testing.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, getting a good ECG signal was very challenging, as testing was done using electrode leads on the hands, which admittedly would give a signal that is quite susceptible to interference (both from surrounding electronics and movements). ALthough we never got an ECG signal close to the ones in the demos online, we did end up with a signal that was definitely an ECG, and had recognizable PQRS phases.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud that we were able to get the Python API working with the bitalino, as it seems that many others at Hack Western 2 were unable to. In addition, I am happy with the way the smoothie.js plot came out, and I think it is a great improvement over the original flot plot.</p>\n<p>Although we did not have time to set up a demo site, I am quite proud of the name our team came up with (lubdub.club).</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot of Javascript, jQuery, Python, and getting ECG signals from less than optimal electrode configurations.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Lubdub Club</h2>\n<p>What's next is to implement some form of wave-signal analysis to clean up the ECG waveform, and to perform calculations to find values like heart rate. Also, I would like to make the Python API / ServerBIT easier to use (maybe rewrite from scratch or at least collect all dependencies in an installer). Other things include adding more features to the HTML site, like changing colour to match heartrate, music, and more educational content. I would like to set up lubdub.club, and maybe find a way to have the data from the bitalino sent to the cloud and then displayed on the webpage. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bitalino\">bitalino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rn1n3r/python-serverbit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rn1n3r/python-serverbit\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["HYO WORLD ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HYO WORLD  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/507/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HYO WORLD  \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/024/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration:</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Sound is a precious thing.

We were intrigued by the idea of having fun and exercising at the same time. Being young as children in the past, our team have all played countless hours of chasing games such as tag and manhunt. However we find that as the rise of technology ever so increases, the new generation of children are playing on their phones. Instead of taking away technology, we decided that it would be an interesting and innovative idea to incorporate technology with fun games to enhance the experience.</p>\n<p><strong>What it does</strong></p>\n<p>Trackathon is an application on the app store that allows users to play a special type of tag with other players who have also installed the app. Trackathon utilizes a variety of technologies ranging from the servers hosting the games, to the app. Upon launching Trackathon, the user is able to enter a game with his / her friend(s) or with other people. After, the users will be assigned a role being either a tagger, or the runner. The tagger's task is to catch the runner and the runner's task is to evade the runner within a certain time period. What makes Trackathon so special and unique is that by using your mobile device, the runner will be able to use a compass to track the runner down. This creates a large amount of strategy built towards the game. The runner will have to think like the tagger to evade the tagger and the tagger will have to think like a runner to find the runner. We use a Global Positioning System (G.P.S) to calculate the distance and angle between the runner and the tagger. Within reaching a meter of the target, the runner starts to lose health and upon reaching zero, the runner is officially caught. This adds an extra dimension to the game and allows for a much more longer and strategic game play.</p>\n<p><strong>How we built it</strong></p>\n<p>As a team, we first devised a detailed plan to ensure that we meet our deadlines and work as a team. We first decided to build the back end and server in preparation for the application and connections. To achieve this, we used the cloud9 service with java which is similar to google docs, but for coding. We then used the Amazon Web Service(AWS) to host the server for the game. For the application we decided to use Android Studio as the development platform for the game. We also used git hub to sync the program / code to ensure that as a team, that we were on the same page.  </p>\n<p><strong>Challenges we ran into</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hosting the server</li>\n<li>Initializing the compass</li>\n<li>Bugs (not the insect XD) </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Accomplishments that we are proud of</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working as a team</li>\n<li>Accomplishing a goal in just 3 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What we learned</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Android Studio</li>\n<li>New algorithms</li>\n<li>Teamwork is important</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What's next for TrackWestern</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>More game modes (eg: manhunt / the tagged become taggers)</li>\n<li>Downloadable content (eg: themes for graphical interface)</li>\n<li>More servers</li>\n<li>Google play store launch</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud9</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kshen3778/HackWestern\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kshen3778/HackWestern\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pstakoun/HackWestern\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/pstakoun/HackWestern\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on setting up the workspace and connections in Cloud9 uses Java and debugging process.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Explore was inspired by accessible virtual reality and augmented reality tools for mobile devices. Not only do these technologies expand the horizons for consumer-level technology, but they pave the way for the acceptance of such technologies in medical institutions and for industrial data analysis and visualization. The tools let us do more for less. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Explore is a technological proof-of-concept that we showcase with a number of different implementations. Specifically, Explore is a virtual reality environment for the Google Cardboard (running on Android mobile devices) that leverages computer vision algorithms to learn about the features in its environment. Using this, we Expand the Google Cardboard to track position in addition to orientation. </p>\n<p>Explore is at least effective for:\n-Games\n-Medical Simulation\n-Art\n-Data Visualization</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The Cardboard is a device that users place on their head in order to experience immersive virtual reality. It works by mounting a phone in front of you and splitting the screen in half, sending each side to one eye. This produces a stereoscopic effect, giving users a 3D effect not that dissimilar to what is experienced at the theatre. The Cardboard then makes use of the on-board gyroscope of your device to provide 360 degree tracking of your head to look around.  Not exactly a fashion item, we had no problem cutting a hole in our Google Cardboard so that the camera can peer through. Using the camera, we integrated Cardboard with an augmented reality API: VuForia. VuForia allows us to track features in our environment, getting both rotational and positional information, whereas the Cardboard on its own only registers orientation. Using this technique, the range of possible applications has become much more broad. We then used Unity (in addition to various other asset creation and analytics tools) to create a number of demos showcasing the various uses we envisioned for Explore.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Combing various development ecosystems into a polished product is always a challenge, especially when accounting for performance constraints on mobile devices. Our biggest challenge was certainly fitting everything onto our phones; in a single app, we perform high quality 3D rendering, perform real-time data analytics, and provide immersive, real-time interface all while tracking our environment and doubling the video burden by rendering in stereo. We had to make it work and then do it twice (once for each eye).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>In our opinion, a weekend of hacking any app together is not likely to produce a polished product that we will be proud of for years to come. As a team, we were most proud of our ability to work well in parallel and use our own strengths and vision to provide unique and complementary solutions and extensions.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We come away from events like these not dwelling on what we have learned, but on how much we still have to learn. The best thing we walk away with is the sense of accomplishment that will fuel our future endeavors to learn and create.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Explore</h2>\n<p>Explore isn't quite ready for the prime time, but we'll make sure it gets there. We'll be extending Explore into a more natural and user-centric domain with the addition of some tech we're working on and through the exploration and leveraging of modern computer vision techniques. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/vuforia\">vuforia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-slicer</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["", "", ""], ["Perspectv", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Perspectv \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/328/290/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Perspectv was built with the ancient proverb, \"As above, so below\" in mind.
