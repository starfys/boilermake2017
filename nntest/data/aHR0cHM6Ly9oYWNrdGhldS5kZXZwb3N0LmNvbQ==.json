This is a large problem.  But recycling is a pain.  Getting people to spend the time to separate their waste in unrealistic.  We thought: why not use the latest technology in machine learning and robotics to do this task for us? Using this technology would allow for the expanded use of recycling in our community. Consumers now do not have to worry about separating out what is recyclable and what is not, as this is taken care of by Bot Sort when the waste is processed. This has the overall implication that the world as a whole will become healthier and better because of reduced landfill use. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Bot Sort takes a picture of a particular item to be sorted. Using machine learning and neural net algorithms, it determines what categories, such as aluminum, plastic, or trash, the item falls into. This information is then sent to a robotic arm which pushes the item into the proper bin. There is also web dashboard to track categories of objects that the system encounters.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Bot Sort is split into two main components, the machine learning object recognition and the physical robotic arm. \nThe computer vision/machine learning portion is based on TensorFlow and written in python. We use a image training data set to train a neural network to determine what is featured in a photo. A snap shot of the item to recognize is then fed into this network where it takes it's best guess as to what the item is. </p>\n<p>The robotic arm is controlled by an arduino which receives commands from the computer. These commands tell the arm to move in a specific pattern that will knock the object into one of the categorization bins. The arduino is running a program written in C that interprets the incoming serial commands and performs the desired action.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Library and camera support were some major challenges with this project. It took some time to figure out which libraries supported which version of python or vice versa. Learning the libraries also took tome time. Since our group was using a combination of 3 different operating systems, it was a challenge to figure out to access the camera on each system. We wanted to create some type of web interface to track the objects that the robot classified, and initially planned on using a javascript library, but we realized we didn't have time to implement. As a result, we ended up Microsofts power BI platform to create a real-time chart to track the object categories.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we were able to meld the two world of hardware and software into one product that performs the task we designed it for. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to implement a neural network in tensor flow and also learned how to use some of the features available on Microsoft's azure.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Bot Sort AKA Kwik Sort</h2>\n<p>The next step for Bot Sort/Kwik Sort is retraining the machine learning algorithm to better recognize the specific materials we will be sorting. We are also looking forward to upgrading our arm to have more power when moving the items. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tensorflow</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">robotics</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TheSorter/bot-sort\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TheSorter/bot-sort\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Hack The Music", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack The Music \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/987/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack The Music \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/988/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack The Music \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/989/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack The Music \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/029/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our team has a passion for music. Some of us have been creating music for a large part of our lives. After reading articles from Harvard Health that describe how music can heal, we decided to use new technology to build a music mobile experience. We were able to branch off of our idea and make a higher quality experience for VR users as well.  This way owners of a HTC vive can enjoy this unique music experience as well. Hitting both our stretch goals has made the project very rewarding!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We used open source sound projects and analytical technology to extract key information about a piece of music. We take a song and essentially split up the different parts of the track. This allows us to map key frequencies or amplitudes to different objects in a VR environment. The experience we are trying to create is meant to be therapeutic as well as relaxing for the user. We want to eventually take this into a more interactive environment.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used unity and various song analysis algorithms to map out an engaging environment for users to immerse in. Our code base is mostly C#. We also have a touch of other languages. We used these technologies so that we can implement our experience in a the Windows Market. We have various types of talent on our team. We have artists, music producers, and software engineers on our team. This has helped us build a unique experience that none of us could accomplish alone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had the trouble of not doing anything VR related prior to the competition. Setting up the Vive in a comfortable area took a lot of time. Having no VR professionals around made it easy to get stuck in situations that would have been solved by having that. Nevertheless the team stayed happy and we got our project done! We also had trouble tackling the music analysis at first. By strategically combining API's and extraction techniques we were able to get useful data out of a music track.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to use our various talents to make a finished project. Usually at hackathons we don't see a way to move a project forward, but we have been proud of our invention and we hope that having a usable cardboard build will allows us to reach a good amount of users. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how VR works!! YES! We also learned how to analyze music in a algorithmic level. We were also able to learn how to work together as a team of diverse individuals. We believe that the the greatest reward that came out of the project is having the outcome of a working together successfully!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hack The Music</h2>\n<p>We are building a finished mobile version to port. We are also going to polish our HTC build. Our goal is to partner with Microsoft and take this experience to the next level!</p>\n<p>Check out our presentation! <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uvNNTCGszLA0B7kYABLyG32ZYXCtTcmy6-ic7mrAY2M/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uvNNTCGszLA0B7kYABLyG32ZYXCtTcmy6-ic7mrAY2M/edit</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">steamvr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/windows-phone\">windows-phone</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ConanZhang/HackTheMusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ConanZhang/HackTheMusic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["My name is Georbec, and I was the main 3D artist for Hack the Music.

As we began to brainstorm ideas, we realized that we sympathize with those who struggle in school, specifically those with ADHD. As we discussed what our game development skills could do for people with this disorder, a massive project emerged in the form of a collection of mini games united in battling ADHD symptoms. We believe it will make a difference for ADHD kids trying to succeed in school and anyone else who seeks improved focus and memory.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Adventure Division HQ is the center of operations for legendary explorers who brave new worlds and solve the problems that halt them in their path. The mini games are presented as missions in strange and dangerous worlds for you, a new explorer, to take on.</p>\n<p>Our collection of mini games seek to eradicate the hindrances those with ADHD often struggle with:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Lack of Focus</strong> (Our Response = fun, stimulating 3D environments in VR)</li>\n<li><strong>Poor Organization</strong> (Response = games depend on organization of objects of interest)</li>\n<li><strong>Poor Time Management</strong> (Response = faster completion times receive higher scores)</li>\n<li><strong>Poor Planning</strong> (Response = involving strategic elements in games)</li>\n<li><strong>Learning Struggles</strong> (Response = games involve short term memory testing)</li>\n<li><strong>Lack of obedience</strong> (Response = game rules that must be followed to succeed)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Possible mini games include 3-D interpretations of I Spy, Where's Waldo, Simon, Memory, the magic cup game, and other observation and memory tests. We would focus on building engaging environments and developing fun gameplay to attract and maintain players. With Google Cardboard as our platform, this game collection would be easy to use and to access. We've white boxed 3-D versions of several potential games, which you can see in our attached screenshots, but our time in this event was spent on implementing one example: a 'spot the differences' game we call <strong>Reflections</strong>.</p>\n<p>In <strong>Reflections</strong>, the player is placed in the center of a bedroom and will soon realize that one side seems identical to the opposite side. There are, however, small differences that the player must pinpoint in order to win. A score is given at the end of the round based on how quickly the level was completed and how many times they turned around (the fewer the better to encourage players to memorize as much as possible from the correct room before marking differences in the other). With these restraints, we account for all six of the points listed above.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Reflections was built in Unity with a focus on Android development in order to utilize Google Cardboard tech. Our VR camera and controls were developed separately from the 3-D environment we're using. After the two were combined, the puzzle was constructed, scoring was implemented, and then we polished as best we could after play-testing.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our big roadblock was with the art assets we inserted into the game. Many weren't responding to user input and displaying visual transformations as expected. We spent a lot of time reworking textures and colliders to solve this issue.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We've impressed ourselves with the size of this project considering our narrow time limit. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>None of us had ever made a game in virtual reality before and we were relieved to find it as simple as it was thanks to the tools at hand. We now know how to get a basic project up and running fairly quickly. We're excited to take these skills to other projects.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Adventure Division HQ (ADHQ)</h2>\n<p>There are many directions we'd be excited to explore: more mini games, art exploration, a partnership with schools, expansion to other platforms, implementing co-op experiences to make it more social, and so forth. </p>\n<p>We'd love to arrange a game day at a local school to test the games with kids and improve play based on what we learn there. As we draw closer to completion, we'd work closely with local schools and therapeutic centers to commercialize this game. We would focus on ADHD kids K through 12 as our target market while offering a strong incentive for their parents and teachers, our primary consumers. After an initial release of a few mini games, we'd collect data on usage patterns and progress metrics and use that to create additional mini games that are more effective and appealing. This all has the potential to be a massive, yet worthwhile challenge.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard\">google-cardboard</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jo411/HackTheU\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jo411/HackTheU\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I added art assets.

Putting the previous photo over the feed was then fairly simple.  Most of my time went into the project structure/display.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I've never successfully used swipe paging in Android (I looked at it when I first started Android, but that was it).  So there was a lot of stuff going on there I didn't understand.  There were several things that the internet said should work but weren't.  I tend to have problems no one else has.  For example, the fragments weren't returning their views for me to put the image overlay in.  That's why I have maintained references to the ImageViews for the different pages and have a problem with using too much memory (though I think there's another problem there somewhere).  I also don't have the fragments immediately updating their titles when you change the name of the project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I feel like I was able to get things done with the app much quicker than I expected to be able to.  And I love the way I have creating a new project set up.  You just swipe all the way over and start taking pictures.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Other than a crash course in fragments and such, I think I learned more in the Java mindset than the styles I have used in other programming languages.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hypercron</h2>\n<p>Design.  It'll eventually look good.  Also, the big point in my vision that I didn't get to was the ability to set up reminders so that if for any reason I wanted to take a picture of my elbow every morning at 5:43 I would get a reminder I could tap on that would open to that specific project, let me take the picture, and close without a lot of unnecessary tapping.  Because progress should be lazy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Music Visuals", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Music visuals through processing</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/routesms-javascript\">routesms-javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TrevorYoko/Fractal_Squares.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TrevorYoko/Fractal_Squares.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Muse", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Augmented learning</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Virtual Museum</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Unity</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Bugs</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Animated solar system</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Interface</p>\n<h2>What's next for Muse</h2>\n<p>Expansion</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on Our universe and scripting the physics of our objects.

We try to get outside at any opportunity possible to enjoy the fresh air, scenery, and exercise. Unfortunately, it is hard to prioritize time outdoors with work, school, and everything else that competes for our time. We decided to make this app to gameify outdoor adventures to help them rise up the priority list.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sumit awards points for reaching impressive destinations. These destinations could include the top of a peak, the middle of a ski run, or the bottom of a slot canyon. Each user has to take a picture at the geotagged location to add the points to their sum. After a user has submitted their picture, they unlock the ability to see the pictures of everybody else who has visited as well. A leaderboard shows how big your sum is compared to your peers.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built two native apps - one for iOS and one for Android. These apps are supported by a database and custom API that store and manipulate data. We use the Google Maps API to display the destinations on a map and compare the geographical coordinates.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our app relies on a series of network requests that connect several different platforms. We had trouble connecting to the wifi in the Lassonde Center so we had to be creative and efficient to make sure that all of our calls were working correctly without wasting too much time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud that we were able to create an application that works seamlessly over two mobile platforms with so many external libraries and databases.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We all improved at GUI design and implementation, database design, networking, and cross-platform development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sumit</h2>\n<p>We plan to launch on the app store this winter and partner with local outdoor retailers to host competitions to win free gear. Some ideas for competitions include - most points in 24 hours, most creative picture at a certain location, and most consistent at exercising outdoors over a month.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mysql-database</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["WeSport", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: Get fit and healthy</h2>\n<h2>What it does Motivate people to exercise &amp; have fun while exercising</h2>\n<h2>How we built it Android-studio + Java</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into We all started from scratch (without any former knowledge)</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of We got the app works</h2>\n<h2>What we learned How to build an Android app + team work</h2>\n<h2>What's next for WeSport We don't know yet</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/benweishi/WeSport\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/benweishi/WeSport\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Dot Dot Dot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dot Dot Dot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/022/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Google Calander works really well, except for the part where you have to fiddle with a text box for several minutes to make sure that you record your information properly. This project seeks to ameliorate a number of issues that keep me from using other organizational software to its full potential, including prioritization, recurring tasks of various frequencies and time constraints, and ease of input</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It generates a unique phonetically pronounceable word, together with a diagram, for any hierarchically nested structure of things. In particular, this is useful for keeping similar diagrams for related tasks. The diagram is hugely faster than text input on a mobile device, and the word is still a lot faster than typing out an entire description, and feels like a cipher --- perhaps a good thing when discussing one's schedule and keeping track of procrastination time.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>with the help of my fingers, free food, and good old fashioned amphetamine salts</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It turns out that, while Android SDK makes life very nice for those of us who like widgets and text fields, those of us who are addicted to low-level vector renderings sometimes have a hard time, particularly when trying to play nice with scrolling mechanisms. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The algorithm for generating the diagrams was not very straightforward, and required both a model of particle diffusion, and static background noise to deterministically break symmetry. The result, though, is that the placements of the nodes are such that each one is a corner (removing the ambiguity of \"did I stop here?\"), and the nodes are all placed compactly in a non-overlapping manner. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Android things! I like XML slightly less than I used to now. After all these years in python, I have learned how incredibly annoying Java can be, and why people used to yell at me for defending it so rigorously. Also, one person is not enough to be excited and happy at a hackathon while also winning, learning, and taking advantage of demos. But this is a good excuse to learn a skill you've wanted to pick up for ages :)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Dot Dot Dot</h2>\n<p>This is definitely a kernel of a good idea, and despite my sleepless demeanor, I will most certainly  continue this project, because already I can see how much more easily it will be to keeptrack of my life with this input system. The grand plan is to do more machine (and human brute-force) learning, so that I can get it to match my own scheduling preferences.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Critter Friend", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>helping save homeless pets for the BestFriends foundation</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>VR video game</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Used Unity and Maya</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>getting the VR movement to work with hands</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>integration of spacial gesture movement in virtual reality</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Critter Friend</h2>\n<p>expanding to other platforms and more public support</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maya\">maya</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AmarZeno/CritterFriend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AmarZeno/CritterFriend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["machine-learning-augmented/virtual-reality", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQjsKgh5BJE?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"machine-learning-augmented/virtual-reality \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/026/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Art and a desire to experience the world in a different way.

People struggle with it on a daily basis while trying to keep track of the various goals they are trying to reach. Whether it is to study for a test, make a run to the grocery store, lose weight or even planning a hackathon project, it is extremely easy to get lost by just focusing on the end goal. We plan to stop this loss of focus entirely.</p>\n<h3>How we are going to to it?</h3>\n<p>We decided that people neeed to start taking advantage of the fact that they can break their goals down into more managable chunks. While many people are aware of this, very few people ever sit down and take the time to actually plan it out. This leads to little details getting left out on the way that either made them unable to reach that end goal or reach an end goal that is incomplete. With Planning Made Easy, we are giving anyone the power to easily break down a goal into managable chunks that are easy to understand and work with.</p>\n<h3>How does this amazing product works?</h3>\n<p>It all starts with the \"End Goal\". This is the big picture, the thing you want to reach at the very end of your journey. Once a user inputs this big idea, they are then prompted with the option to split that idea into smaller goals, \"milestones\" you may call it. By breaking goals up into these \"milestones\" it gives users the understanding that there are certain things that must be one before any goal can be accomplished. These \"milestones\" have no limits and can be as few as zero to as many as your computer can hold. But it doesn't stop with just the end goal that takes a few steps to get to, we want users to break their goals up even further than that. This is why each milestone is viewed as its own goal, which can have milestones underneath it. As users realize they can break tasks into smaller and smaller pieces, they start to feel the pressure of one big goal go away and obtain a set of instructions on exactly how they can reach their goal. It is customized to their needs and has no limits of how large or how small their idea is. This software is applicable to practically any situation someone can think of. </p>\n<h3>Challenges we faced</h3>\n<p>Given the nature of the hackathon, we decided to try to develop this idea as an Android app. None of us had any experience developing for Android, so all our opbstacles were related to using the power of Android Studio to our advantage instead of having it be the one thing that held us back. It took us many hours of reading and trail and error, but given the limited amount of time we had we believe that we developed a very functional app that demonstrates the core concept of our idea.</p>\n<h3>Plans for the future</h3>\n<p>At the moment our app only allows users to create new \"End Goals\", create sub-goals and then branch those sub goals into smaller sub-goals. We want this app to be something that isn't limited to one type of goal. We want this app to be universal in it's applications. With more development, we would add more features that each goal contained, such as the DATE TO FINISH it by and possibly some monetary figures that went along with it. We also believe that repositioning goals to better fit the overall approach towards the end goals is something that we wanted to implement during this event, but simply ran out of time to do.</p>\n<h3>What we learned from this experience</h3>\n<p>None of us had ever done a hackathon before this one, and we believe the biggest thing we learned was how valuable the seemingly little amount of knowledge we came in with was. Being unafraid to approach a seemingly impossible task by breaking down the parts into bite-sized chunks helped us immensely. We were able to solve the short term problems when they arose and through our persistence we were able to succeffuly make a functional app, something we were skeptical about making before the start of the competition.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexrybrown/PlanningMadeEasy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexrybrown/PlanningMadeEasy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Cardiac Traveler", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/959/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/960/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/961/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/962/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/963/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/964/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/965/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/966/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/967/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 10\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/968/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 11\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/969/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cardiac Traveler \u2013 screenshot 12\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/440/970/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We have noticed a pain.

We used many files to make this game, and we think that's quite an achievement.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were distracted for the first 15 hours of the Hackathon, but pulled together as a team after that to make this project work. It was -- to be fair -- nothing short of a miracle that we made it this far in this short a time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We used many files to make this game and we think that's quite an achievement. We are proud that the first game we made is going to revolutionize the world. Additionally, we're also proud of the lore in the game, which is at least as deep as the lore seen in the Elder Scrolls franchise. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We improved our Python and Pygame skills. We also learned necessary skills as CS majors that in some form will help us along the line.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Broccoli Consumption Simulator</h2>\n<p>Depending on how today's presentation goes, we may have an IPO in the near future. We plan on making even more content for the game to further appease our fan base.

For example, learning highlights from playing the game Scrabble Junior fosters literacy and language skills for children, while the game Monopoly offers teenagers opportunity to develop their math, reading, reasoning, and social skills [2]. Studies from Alzheimer centers have proven that adults who regularly play games not only promote mental stimulations, but help keep memory function [3]. Research has reported that playing board games twice a week increases the brain speed scores of children by 27 to 32 percent, and two studies in the journal Cognition, published by MIT and UC-Berkeley, report that children who play games develop \u201ca stronger sense of creativity and inquisitiveness\u201d [3]. According to [2], board games are a medium which connect families to each other and foster positive communication. As well, board games help manage stress successfully, and maintain healthy relationships within the family.</p>\n<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Table-top games have proven to enhance the lives of people of all ages. From children fostering the ability to focus to adults reducing their risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, games continue to play a significant role in people\u2019s success in life. Recent prevalence in table-top games have increased production and sales for the game industry, thus providing a large variety of table-top game options to users. The volume of table-top options available to users, however, is problematic as buying new, unfamiliar games is a risk, since purchase cannot guarantee play satisfaction, and 100% refunds are not warrantied if game components have been tampered with. Existing websites such as Amazon and Barnes and Noble recommend table-top games to users, but their methodology is based on consumer purchase patterns which neglect game characteristics in their non-personalized recommendations. \u00a0Game characteristics, such as popularity, number of players, complexity, play time, and different categorization of games are essential features to be considered in making personalized recommendations to users. These characteristics can significantly affect the satisfaction level of game play when players experiment with new table-top games. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>In order to assist users in finding games of interest to play and enrich the player\u2019s game-playing experience, we developed the TTGames application, a novel tool of recommending the latest and most personally intriguing table-top games for users. Personalized table-top game recommendations are based on user game interest and are ranked using a multiple linear regression model with game feature information extracted from online sources.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We collected data from BoardGameGeek.com for several hours. The data contained many useful features to create an effective ranking algorithm. We used MySQL for the database, and java for our server. The front end was constructed using Angular js. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our ideas kept changing :) so we had to make sure we were all communicating and working effectively to create a great product. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our ranking algorithm and all of the goals we met during this time. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Angular, css, and HTTPRequests.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TTGames</h2>\n<p>Make it secure, scalable, and available for everyone to use!</p>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<p>[1] Young, Sarah D. \"The Benefits of Playing Board Games with Children.\" Consumer Affairs. 01 Feb. 2016. <a href=\"https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/the-benefits-of-playing-board-games-with-children-020116.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/the-benefits-of-playing-board-games-with-children-020116.html</a>.</p>\n<p>Unlike video games, table-top games provide face-to-face interactions that help foster human relationships.

Travel the world in search of supplies and fight off the undead.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this as an application using an Ionic framework that makes it easier to create the app natively. We also used a third party AR builder called Wikitude in order to utilize the phone's full potential and AR experience</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Most of our problems came from setting up the environments to work in AR and native applications. Some of them were resolved quickly, and others were hair-pullers. Luckily nothing was impossible to fix!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This was our first attempt at an Augmented Reality game, so for us, finishing with something usable was a big win! We also loved being able to work together as a team once again.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Zombies IRL</h2>\n<p>Zombies IRL will be expanding a few features we didn't have time to tackle, like a backpack and a home base. We also want to make sure it gets in the app store soon!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wikitude</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I brought the love for zombie fighting and an excitement for learning AR!
