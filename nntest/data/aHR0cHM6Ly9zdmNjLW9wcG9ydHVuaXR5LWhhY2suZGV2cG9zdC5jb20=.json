This motivated us to help the organization, Rising International build a new interface for these amazingly talented women to sell their products on a global scale. The mission and vision of Rising International inspired us to go the extra mile and build this application for them</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a one-stop platform for women in a high-risk environment to fend for themselves. This website enables the sellers and buyers an online stage for selling the artisan's work of art.  A lucid yet attractive display of statistics is given for the buyers. This application is aimed to replace the manual completion of paper forms.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our web application uses performance driven and efficiency outlined languages, architectures, framework and User Interfaces. We have used angularJS, HTML5, CSS3,Bootstrap, NodeJS, MySQL, IBM Bluemix for developing this end to end web application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had a huge discussion and brainstorming session for understanding the system requirements. Getting a clear picture of the entire workflow was one of the challenges our team ran into.\nIntegration of various platforms like the static HTML with the dynamic data was a challenging task.\nCreation of illustrative and attractive user interface while keeping the interface easy to use was also one of the hiccups we ran into.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Implementing the QR code scanning interface to the mobile users. This effectively replaces manual filling of forms.</p>\n<p>Adding a touch of graphs and pie charts to the dashboard of the user helps the user understand the results better.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team had a very good learning experience in better understanding the technology. Not just the technology, our team now understands the pain of an artisan and the huge steps taken by Non-Profit Organizations like Rising Internationals in aiding these artisans and valuing their skills. We now better understand the effort that goes into achieving women empowerment.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rising Technologies</h2>\n<p>Rising Technologies provided us with unique and challenging requirements. This gave our team an amazing opportunity to develop efficient and supportable code which can be easily scaled and expanded. We will be more than happy to further extend our efforts in helping the organization by developing a full-scale end to end online marketplace, which might as well be the end product what the organization is looking at.

Today, with same thought we all gathered together. \nWhile Silicon Valley is one of the most affluent places in the USA, hunger is still an issue. Statistics suggest that one in five kids in  the USA do not get the food they need to lead a healthy life. On one side where there are so many hungry people, every day around 30 percent of food is wasted. We tried our bit by providing a platform to supply this food for hungry poor people.\nWe actively partner with many food distributors to build transnational relationships and renew communities. Our view of poverty is holistic and complex. Our solutions are innovative and community-specific. We honor the people we serve by inviting them to contribute to the process. More than anything, we want to see people thrive. Thus we try to bring a little change. </p>\n<p>## Our Solution</p>\n<p>We have developed a simple to use location-based Android app for this problem. As soon as the user opens the app they are presented with a real-time map showing where the nearby food resources are available. The user can then select any of these locations. If the user decides to go to one of these places he/she can simply tap to navigate. We have also enhanced our App with the notification alerts where the user gets notified as soon as a food resource becomes available in his neighbourhood . Thus the user can be informed about where the food is, and can reach the location in time. We made sure that at no point the user is required to sign up or fill a form as this could be a deterrent. </p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-SJC-SVCC/TeamXero\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-SJC-SVCC/TeamXero\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on Research work for  Firebase push notifications.\nAlso contributed towards the implementation of the same.\nI worked on the frontend for the Details and Get Direction page", "I worked on backend part of Node.js server.

When clients at Mission Asset Fund receive this advice, they may feel confused and frustrated. \"I just told you that I don't own any major assets because I moved to this country only two years ago and that I don't have any savings because I'm still supporting my family back home. How can these be the right next steps for me?\"\nWhen a client walks through MAF's doors asking how to improve their financial well being, how can we meet people where they're at, with advice and resources that are relevant for them? And how can we make sure that what content we deliver is readily actionable?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our mobile app* addresses these challenges by providing a one stop shop for financial coaching. We ask the users to tell us a little about themselves and, based on their answers, continually suggest resources like financial videos, tips, and nearby services that meet the needs they report. Users have the ability to save resources to view later and create an action plan to track goals and follow through with the resources they find helpful. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This app leverages native mobile technology, in order to provide the best possible experience to MAF's largely mobile first clients.

The item details can be inputted both from mobile interface and Salesforce.com.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Capturing the item details during no network and synchronizing the captured data at later point. Authenticating the Android/IOS application with the Salesforce Org. and avoiding the duplication.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The mobile application captures the data during the offline mode and capable enough to synchronize to the CRM when there is a network. We enforce clean data at the time of capture at mobile and salesforce platform. The system ensures paperless transactions between the clients and the Development staff at the office saving a great amount of time and effort.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Salesforce authentication, Salesforce REST APIs, IONIC, Angular</p>\n<h2>What's next for Unity Care Inventory System</h2>\n<p>Future of the Donation System is to extend it to a Order Fulfillment system. The clients are facilitated with online order functionality and get it picked from the office at their convenience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/salesforce\">salesforce</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-SJC-SVCC/Zephyr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2016-SJC-SVCC/Zephyr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["Main Street Launch Website", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Main Street Launch Website \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/416/054/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Page1</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Main Problem</h2>\n<p>Small businesses in the East Oakland to downtown corridor don't have the time or resources to maintain their online presence.
