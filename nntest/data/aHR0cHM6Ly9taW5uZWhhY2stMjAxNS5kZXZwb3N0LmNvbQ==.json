Due to this, we wanted to explore a way to provide more value to the customer by allowing them to redirect some of the revenue based on their participation in the advertisement industry to causes that they care about.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We automated a web advertisement delivery platform to target audiences that have a desire to contribute a very small portion of their internet usage time to organizations that support their causes. We have a Chrome application that delivers targeted advertisements at user selected intervals (30min, 1hour, 4hours, etc.) and provides feedback on the amount of user contribution as well as total organization contribution.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built the application on a website/chrome extension platform. We stored data in the backend on MariaDB and ran our servers from a PHP platform. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some issues with integrating Google API to our application. We had a lot of issues implementing the windows popup screen through the Google Extension API. On a higher-level, we had some issues zoning in on a viable idea for the Hackathon, but we are glad we were able to finish this project!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We finished it! We also we are very proud of actually being able to work as a team to complete this project despite initial disagreements on the direction of the project. We feel that it was a wonderful experience and we learned a lot with respect to program design as well as program implementation.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that, while carrying out a design from the ground up is difficult, the true difficulty lies within the ability to face those challenges as a team and not throwing out an idea because it seems difficult. In addition, we learned much about website development and server side control. From utilizing new tools such as Google's API to sharpening our existing stack of HTML and PHP, we have made the most of this experience and had a wonderful time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Browse-Well</h2>\n<p>We will take the judges/peers opinions into consideration as well as do some more business side analysis on the feasibility of furthering this project.

When you are on the page you want to save, press the hotkey command for 'Pushd'.\nWhen you are done searching something and want to go back to your saved place, press the hotkey for 'Popd'. You can save(push)\nas many pages as you would like, and you can keep using the 'Popd' command until you are back to your first saved place.</p>\n<h4>A Peek at our Extension</h4>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>{\n    \"name\": \"PushD PopD\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"manifest_version\": 2,\n    \"icons\": {\n      \"16\": \"save16.png\", \n      \"48\": \"save48.png\", \n      \"128\": \"save.png\"\n    },\n    \"permissions\": [\n      \"tabs\", \"&lt;all_urls&gt;\"\n    ],\n    \"background\": {\n        \"scripts\": [\"background.js\"]\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/EDawg878/PushD-PopD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/EDawg878/PushD-PopD\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Lead developer for the extension", "Designed and integrated the visual graphics into chrome extension", "Created and helped to code the notifications for the extension", "Working on website for the extension "]], ["HealthChat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HealthChat \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/709/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It's an app inspired by realizing the need for a chat forum for patients who want instant consultation from doctors.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's a chat forum that allows patients to chat with doctors regarding their problems.

However, for the average shopper, it is difficult to know which products are actually sustainable. Who has the time to research everything on their list, or even understand what makes a product sustainable? </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This online resource will allow a person to search for the items they want to buy and instantly see which ones are sustainable and why. A shopping list is then created which automatically categorizes each item.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We originally started with Java, and JavaFX, but soon moved over to a PHP server with HTML/JS. The API has no search, so we kept the Java HTML parser we created. We run a bash command to call the java file from PHP, which is Ajaxed to from our JS. We use jQuery Mobile for the interface. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>NO SEARCH WITH THE API!!!!!!! We had to build a Java class that searches based on a keyword, parses the TCIN from the website's thumbnail images. We could then use those in API calls. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>How we hacked different distinct pieces together. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A little bit about JavaFX, some web language skills. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://l2software.net/target/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://l2software.net/target/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>l2software.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Ionic To-Do List", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ionic To-Do List \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/642/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ionic To-Do List \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/643/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I had previously worked with web design scripts, and have always wanted to create a mobile app. With Ionic, I'm able to use my existing knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully functional mobile application!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Each of my four classes I'm taking this semester at UW Madison are in a list on the startup screen. Selecting any of these classes will show each assignment I have weekly for that particular class. These assignments can be selected as checkboxes to mark them being done.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Before coming to this hackathon, I had minimal to no knowledge of how angular.js worked. Now, I understand its functionality and have used it to sculpt the backbone of my app. Using my new knowledge of angular and my integrated knowledge of the Ionic Frameworks, I was able to create an app with multiple nested views and selectable items.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating an app using 2 frameworks I knew little about was difficult. I had to start out learning the basics of angular and what its purpose was. I originally started out making small angular web pages in order to learn angular's functionality instead of going big right away. I made a horoscope app, an app using the Google Maps API, and then finally the To-Do list app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Coming in to this hackathon, my goal was simply to create a mobile app, regardless of functionality. I ended up creating an app that not only looks nice, but has multiple functions and features I had no idea I would be able to implement. I am proud that I was able to come in, learn 2 frameworks in a night, and churn out a functional app that I can use every day.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned both the angular framework and the Ionic framework. I learned how to combine both to create a mobile application without any native code.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MinnehackIonicApp</h2>\n<p>When I get back to Madison, I will focus on modifying the storage of the values of each assignment, making my app able to remember which assignments I have completed and which ones I have yet to complete. I can set alerts on the app to remind me if the deadline for a certain assignment I haven't completed is near. This is an app I can use everyday, so using the skills I've learned here I can develop it into something unique.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bboettcher3/MinnehackIonicApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bboettcher3/MinnehackIonicApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["VR Science", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VR Science \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/908/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>I think that trying to learn in a 2D environment is boring, so why not spice up our lives</h2>\n<h2>I allows you to be as close as you could possibly be to these 3D structures</h2>\n<h2>With a lot of patience and using Unity with the Gear VR SDK and C# to script it all</h2>\n<h2>Mobile SDK wasn't correct, app randomly crashed, had to learn how to model basic 3D models</h2>\n<h2>I went from never touching Unity or VR Developing and now I have a working app that can only grow</h2>\n<h2>VR is the future!</h2>\n<h2>What's next for VR Chemistry</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/samsung-gear-vr\">samsung-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]]]
