As an event organizer, I've also desperately tried to get people to eat all the free food at my events when they are woefully under attended. We've been meaning to make this app for years, and have even said to each other \"shoulda FoodReconned that!\" to our friends when we get to the extra food before they did.

The fact that some of the bravest Americans are beating beaten by waiting times is not something we should be proud of. It should be in all of our best interests that veterans come home to the best care this country has to offer.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There are two parts to our project. The first is a website that provides relevant information for military members and their families. By compiling a list of relevant APIs and formatting it for a user friendly experience, we have made the struggle of finding the best care facility a little more manageable. </p>\n<p>For the long term, we used used Fiscal Note's API to research voting records of US representatives to shed light on America's stance on veterans. While every bit helps, we should not be satisfied with a slightly lesser burden for searching for care. As such, we used machine learning to analyze the text of recent bills. By providing a better understanding of our government's policies, we hope to encourage more people to vote and implement the changes they wish to see themselves.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The website was built using HTML, CSS, Django, Mongodb, Javascript, Jquery and Python. In order to manipulate the data as well as possible, we switched languages fairly frequently. The APIs used came from the Veteran's Affair's website.</p>\n<p>The research into the bills was done exclusively in Python. We utilized gensim and word2vec in order numerically analyze the language of the bills. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Welcome HomePage</h2>\n<p>The research was a late addition to our project. As a result, we could not do a second layer of analysis (We used clustering to analyze the data, but I would have also liked to have used vector averages in order to see consistencies within the bill itself).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/koprty/VeteranHack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/koprty/VeteranHack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["yhackslackpack", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Fjnrok3ARU?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h3>What is yHaCkSlAcKpAcK?.</h3>\n<p>A collection of slack integrations to make your life easier and your work flow-ier.\nInteractions with the external services are text-based, via a bot. \nThere are 3 integrations provided out-of-the-box, but they're all built on a framework that makes it easy to add more.

This results in the rise of middle-man sales dealers (expedia, travelocity, etc) willing to fill this void. </p>\n<p>We believed that by designing a search methodology that is built from the ground up, predicated on how consumers approach planning a vacation, we could yield a win-win scenario; first, being able to enlighten travellers to the many options they have based on their personalized constraints (schedule, price) and preferences (general geographic location, type of vacation, specific city preference), and second, to allow airlines to better market their reduced fare, last minute getaway packages in an attempt to minimize the cost of empty seats on flights.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>On the topic of impacts, North Star does two things. It helps consumers plan travel in a more intuitive and natural way than ever before, and it helps prevent unnecessary losses for airlines.</p>\n<p>Airlines participate by allowing us access to their data or APIs (JetBlue and priceline supplied us with data sets here), and consumers benefit by using our site. </p>\n<p>*<em>TL;DR: People can take more vacations. Airlines lose less money. *</em></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>So many of these things were done concurrently, but if we were to break them up into individual actions, they'd be as follows.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Downloaded data sets from JetBlue and Priceline\n1b. Parse wikipedia for accessory data (Flight code --&gt; Airport Name --&gt; Airport City --&gt; City Longitude/Latitude)</li>\n<li>Set up server on Azure</li>\n<li>Populate SQL server</li>\n<li>Integrate facebook</li>\n<li>Write search algorithm / build front end for user inputs\n5b. Design all static images (radio button icons for flight properties, company logo, etc).</li>\n<li>Designed map interface, planned how the data would influence dynamic changes in the map\n6b. Used beaker and Priceline data to show analytics on charts so that consumers can have a better idea of how the current flight prices compare to the historical values, or to compare prices by airline.</li>\n<li>Built the 'infinite scroll' functionality and polished up front end</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Not having an API to dynamically call information makes for a lot of wasted time when we consistently need to remake/repopulate the database.</p>\n<p>We messed up with how we imported the dates and times of flights in our SQL database. This was huge, since times and dates are 2 out of the 3 most crucial pieces of information (after location).</p>\n<p>Python really really <strong>really</strong> doesn't like unicode. Our parser broke 2-3 times when it encountered hyphenated airport names or accented letters.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Scalability *<em>(Database layout, algorithm efficiency)\nThis is our team's third consecutive data hack submission at a hackathon, so concepts like efficiency and resource utilization are things that are prioritized whenever possible. We believe that after multiple projects that utilized 'bandaid' fixes under the 'Fuck it, ship it' mentality, we've finally started to do things the 'right' way, and in a way that is scalable.\n*</em>2. Innovation</strong>\nWe were able to attack a seemingly stale methodology from a fresh perspective. Disruption is cool, and being the new kid on the block is always fun.\n*<em>3. We learned a lot. *</em>\nBeaker, Facebook API, Microsoft Azure, and tons of SQL troubleshooting. Despite the fact that we all have very distinct and unique skills with a bit of overlap, we all ended up doing far more work that was outside of our respective comfort zones than ever before for this multi-leveled hack.</p>\n<p>this memorable quote summarizes it pretty well: \nBrian Chen: <em>\"Please, no more SQL. I can't handle any more.\"</em> \nNick: <em>\"You gon' learn today, you gon' learn real good about SQL, inside and out\".</em></p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Take care of your most important data points/structures first. Data is love, data is life - except when it takes a combined <strong>6 hours</strong> to repeatedly repopulate your database after improper planning. ALWAYS think your database through ahead of time!</p>\n<p>Beaker is <em>awesome</em>. Nick loves working with data, and for him, Beaker is a gift from the heavens. He wishes it could work with MATlab too, but he doesn't want to push his luck. </p>\n<h2>What's next for North Star</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Increase the amount of data that we have!</strong>\nWe were given finite data sets by sponsors, so by having live access to either APIs or more time to parse websites, the data would only further serve to increase the effectiveness of North Star.</p>\n<p>*<em>2. Continued Brand Differentiation *</em>\nDespite the fact that many other travel sites supply tons of functionality with their seemingly endless filters, it all comes across in a very cold and emotionless way. For most people, travelling is a fun (or at least emotional) experience, and we believe that the process leading up to it should be no different. If North Star were to be continued, it should embrace its different style of approach by getting user feedback and continuing to make things 'shiny' and 'more polished'. Although it's not frequently spoken about, user experience on a travel site could be the difference between a consumer packing their bags for an overnight getaway or sitting home on their couch to Netflix and chill.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Innovative Data Processing/Empowerment</strong>\nBy incorporating Priceline data (which contains data from a multitude of airlines) and combining it with Beaker, we have the power to offer a platform with a stronger price analysis tool than any other competitor. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Integrate Consumer Behavioral Science</strong>\nBeyond conscious preferences of the consumer, a multitude of market research papers reveal trends that differentiate spending patterns within the airline industry. By having access to more data from our users (geographic location, approximate income level by zip code, race, age), we could use these demographic values to alter the meta-rankings generated by our database search algorithm, showing results that are more in line with what the consumer ultimately will be interested in considering. One example of this, is that millenials are 60% more likely to book a flight that is discounted than nonmillenials. Another, comparing the same two groups, is that millenials are significantly more likely to pay a premium to upgrade to an airline seat with more leg room, while also disproportionately prioritizing budget-oriented airlines. We successfully integrated the Facebook API to easily get demographic information about our consumer, however, without a significant amount of time (or money) to access these market research studies, we didn't have much to work with during the time of the hackathon to implement justified meta rankings. We were mindful of this though, and set up our database in such a way that we could easily implement these factors as multipliers/scalars if continued.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">beaker</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">red-bull</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://thenorthstar.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://thenorthstar.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>thenorthstar.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Database search algorithm planner.

Flights are still a hassle to find and purchase, even with tools such as Google Flights, Kayak, and Skiplagged. All travel apps use the same sets of input from users: destination, dates, and times. We've taken it a step further and catered flights to find your next trip by using a custom algorithm that analyzes your social media. Flights come paired with hotels as a package. Save more money by sharing the trip with your friends.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our custom algorithm analyzes your past behavior, your friends' trends, and what you're looking for, to provide you with only the best results. Forget about comparing a slew of numbers and words and focus on finding your next trip. </p>\n<p>We've revamped the buying experience; share select trips with friends to let them know about great deals and future plans. Sharing a trip kickstarts an auction process - as the trip grows in popularity, the price decreases accordingly! MetBlue combines a ranked infinite scroll with interactive tickets.</p>\n<p>It's a win-win for both the consumers and airlines: buyers receive discounts while airlines can fill flights on short notice. By increasing social proof and popularity, we fill empty seats at competitive prices.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We rely on MongoDB and Ruby to reference our data and provide your next trip. Our UI and UX heavily emphasizes a more minimalistic and fun experience over the commonplace arduous ticket hunting process. A combination of front end development tools creates a streamlined searching and check out flow. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Mapping and developing connections based on social data and individual search filters was a major hurdle to creating a smooth experience. Developing a high-speed infinite scrolling interface and integrating data to MetBlue's unique ticket system was also a major concern. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our design has come together very cohesively, and our search functions are efficient and quick.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jetblue</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fueledbymarvin/metblue\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fueledbymarvin/metblue\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Next Destination", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Next Destination \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/254/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>We made a gorgeous website to plan flights with Jet Blue's data sets.

Prototyping is made simple thanks to the speed of development in <code>R</code>, and the ability to use and distribute powerful statistical analyses packages on the central <code>R</code> repository, <code>CRAN</code>, enable <code>R</code> to do even more than just stats, with an infinitely scrollable table powered by the Javascript library <a href=\"http://datatables.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">DataTables</a>.</p>\n<h2>The Dataset</h2>\n<p><em>Jet Blue</em> provided a sample dataset consisting of their available flight offerings running from October 26, 2015 thru February 29, 2016. Each flight consists of the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Origin, Destination : three-letter airport codes</li>\n<li>Flight Time : consists of departure date and time</li>\n<li>FareType : \"POINTS\" and \"LOWEST\" designated the type of fare described subsequently</li>\n<li>DollarFare, DollarTax or PointsFare, PointsTax : the cost of the given flight</li>\n<li>Flight Type : in this sample dataset, the only type available was \"NONSTOP\" </li>\n<li>isDomesticRoute, isPrivateFare : domestic and private flight designations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, a database of annotation corresponding to each airport was made available. Each airport is annotated with the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MarketGroupName, MarketGroupId : local market group that airport belongs to, whose values include the following: \"Mountain/Desert | Northeast | Caribbean | SouthSW | California | Mid-Atlantic\"</li>\n<li>GeographicRegionName, GeographicRegionId : a finer version of market, identifies the local geographic region/id that airport belongs to, whose values include the following: ANC | BOS Area | Colombia | Desert West | DR | FLL | Gulf | LA Area | MCO | MidWest | Mtn West | NE Islands | NYC | Other Carrib | Pac NW | PBI | PR | SF Bay | Texas | The South | Upstate | WAS</li>\n<li>DestinationTypeName : the getaway type, which includes: \"Family | Nightlife | Exploration | Romance | Beach\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this dataset, only nonstop, outbound flights were considered, however, all the methods below could be easily extended to account for inbound (return) flights - while multiple stops would require a not inconsequential effort to implement, this would certainly be an avenue worth pursuing for future development.</p>\n<h2>The Algorithm</h2>\n<p>The method behind the flight ranking takes into account a variety and multiples of inputs and their relative importance to one another, ranging from getaway types, specific or regional origin and destination sites and consideration of airports nearby, budget, and desired dates of travel. Our approach provides an infinitely scrollable list of options - but the secret sauce is in taking into account this multitude of potential preferences and weighing them against one another to surface the best possible flights.</p>\n<h3>Logistic Scaling of Fuzzy Matches</h3>\n<p>Our approach looks for exact matches when possible (as in the case of getaway type, region, airport codes), but there are cases where we need to consider the \"fuzzy\" matches, and how to weight these. For example, let's say we specify that we would like to fly between June 5th and June 10th. If we simply used a binary encoding, we would miss out on a potentially great deal on June 11th or June 4th. However, we don't really care to see anything on May 25th, no matter how good of a deal - that simply would be too far from our desired weights. Similarly, given a budget of $200, we would hate to miss out on a $225 flight that fits all the rest of our preferences! </p>\n<p>To address this \"close but not quite\" problem, we implemented a logistic scaling function to allow for close matches in preferred dates and budgets. This logistic scaling function rapidly decays as it goes outside of the given boundaries - as in the case of preferred dates. For a given budget, this is modified slightly, such that for a cost that exceeds budget, the penalty grows slowly, but then rapidly increases as cost exceeds the budget by $50 to $100. Conversely, as cost goes below a given budget, at first it is of slow benefit, but then rapidly gets \"rewarded\" the lower the cost goes, representing a steal of a deal.</p>\n<h3>Order Importance Scaling</h3>\n<p>An additional factor to consider is when inputting multiple options, one needs to consider whether they are <em>unordered</em> (of equal importance) or <em>ordered</em> (ranked from high to low importance). Here, we have taken into account the order by which certain options, such as getaway type or to/from departure info (which could be specific airport codes or geographic regions).</p>\n<p>To account for ordering of such preferences, we applied an order importance function which weights the first to last preferences of a given field (such as to <em>or</em> from <em>or</em> getaways) from high to low importance. To do this, we add together a uniform and exponential distribution, each scaled by (1 -) parameter <code>Order Importance</code> (<code>OI</code>). This parameter, filed under <code>Advanced Options</code>, determines whether the preferences should be treated as unordered (<code>OI = 0</code>) thus resembling the uniform distribution, or exponential (<code>OI = 1</code>), where the first preferences are highly weighted and lower preferences are heavily penalized. By default, <code>OI</code> is set to <code>0.7</code>, to allow for a moderate weighting of higher preferences, and thus is represented by a mixture of exponential (<code>70%</code>, with a rate of <code>3</code>) and uniform (<code>30%</code>) distributions.</p>\n<h3>Nearby?</h3>\n<p>Sometimes, your favorite airport might not be the best place to go for the best flight deals - for example, from New Haven, it is equally easy (or difficult) to navigate to either <em>BDL</em> or <em>JFK</em> or <em>LGA</em>. To address this, we have added an option to include nearby airports, leveraging the local geographic region each airport is classified under to cluster them together.</p>\n<h3>Preference Importance - Coefficients</h3>\n<p>For cases where some preferences may be more important than others, the <code>Coefficients</code> under <code>Advanced Options</code> allows for the ultimate tweaking of our algorithm. For cases where the departure date is an absolute must, and everything else is secondary, the user can tweak up the coefficient for <code>Depart Date</code>, or if budget is of no concern, this can be set to <code>0</code>.</p>\n<h3>Infinitely Scrollable &amp; Rapidly Updateable</h3>\n<p>Any good algorithm must provide results post haste, and to that end, our solution provides an infinitely scrollable ranking of pertinent flight results, and rapidly updates upon any tweaks to the settings made therein.</p>\n<h2>Happy Deal Hunting!</h2>\n<p>Thanks for trying our app!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rshiny</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://sparsedata.shinyapps.io/jb-flight-deals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://sparsedata.shinyapps.io/jb-flight-deals\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>sparsedata.shinyapps.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sparsedata/jb-flight-deals\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sparsedata/jb-flight-deals\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["JetBand", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Seeing how wearable technology can make our lives easier and how Jetblue needed a way for its consumers to have easy access to flight information and be able to easily buy it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Informs consumers of affordable flights they would likely be interested in and catalyzes a seamless travel process.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>It was built in Android Studio.

DAV - Disabled American Veterans organization has spent about $ 61.8 million to buy and operate vehicles to act as a transit service for veterans but the reach of this program is limited.</h2>\n<p>Following these stats we wanted to support Veterans with something more feasible and efficient.</p>\n<h2>What it does: It is a web application that will serve as a common platform between DAV and Uber. Instead of spending a huge amount on buying cars the DAV instead pay Uber and Uber will then provide free rides to veterans. Any veteran can register with his Veteran ID and SSN. During the application process our Portal matches the details with DAV to prevent non-veterans from using this service. After registration, Veterans can request rides on our website, that uses Uber API and can commute free.</h2>\n<h2>How we built it: We used the following technologies:</h2>\n<p>Uber API ,Google Maps, Directions, and Geocoding APIs, WAMP as local server.\nBoot-Strap to create website, php-MyAdmin to maintain SQL database and webpages are designed using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python script etc.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into: Using Uber API effectively, by parsing through data and code to make javascript files that use the API endpoints. Also, Uber API has problematic network/server permission issues.</h2>\n<p>Another challenge was to figure out the misuse of this service by non-veterans. To save that, we created a dummy Database, where each Veteran-ID is associated with corresponding 4 digits SSN. The pair is matched when user registers for free Uber rides. For real-time application, the same data can be provided by DAV and that can be used to authenticate a Veteran.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of: Finishing the project well in time, almost 4 hours before. From a team of strangers, brainstorming ideas for hours and then have a finished product in less than 24 hours.</h2>\n<h2>What we learned: We learnt to use third party APIs and gained more experience in web-development.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for VeTransit:  We plan to launch a smartphone app that will be developed for the same service.</h2>\n<p>It will also include Speech recognition.

Not wanted to interact with employees to get what you want? Now you can buy items quickly and hassle free through your phone, without interacting with any people whatsoever.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>CheckMeOut is an iOS application that allows users to buy an item that has been 'locked' in a store.

I really felt compelled to make something that I learned inside the classroom and apply my education to something practical.  Growing up I always remembered playing with magnetic kits and loved the feeling of repulsion between magnets.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There is a base layer of small magnets all taped together so the North pole is facing up.  There are hall effect devices to measure the variances in magnetic field that is created by the user's magnet attached to their finger.  This allows the device to track the user's finger and determine how they are interacting with the magnetic field pointing up.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>It is build using the intel edison.  Each hall effect device is either on or off depending if there is a magnetic field pointing down through the face of the black plate.  This determines where the user's finger is.  From there the analog data is sent via serial port to the processing program on the computer that demonstrates that it works.  That just takes the data and maps the motion of the object.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There are many challenges I faced.  Two of them dealt with just the hardware.  I bought the wrong type of sensors.  These are threshold sensors which means they are either on or off instead of linear sensors that give a voltage proportional to the strength of magnetic field around it.  This would allow the device to be more accurate.  The other one deals with having alot of very small worn out magnets.  I had to find a way to tape and hold them all together because they are in an unstable configuration to create an almost uniform magnetic field on the base.  Another problem I ran into was dealing with the edison,  I was planning on just controlling the mouse to show that it works but the mouse library only works with the arduino leonardo.  I had to come up with a way to transfer the data to another program, which is how i came up dealing with serial ports and initially tried mapping it into a Unity game.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of creating a hardware hack that I believe is practical.  I used this device as a way to prove the concept of creating a more interactive environment for the user with a sense of touch rather than things like the kinect and leap motion that track your motion but it is just in thin air without any real interaction.  Some areas this concept can be useful in is in learning environment or helping people in physical therapy learning to do things again after a tragedy, since it is always better to learn with a sense of touch.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I had a grand vision of this project from thinking about it before hand and I thought it was going to theoretically work out great!  I learned how to adapt to many changes and overcoming them with limited time and resources.  I also learned alot about dealing with serial data and how the intel edison works on a machine level.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tactile Leap Motion</h2>\n<p>Creating a better prototype with better hardware(stronger magnets and more accurate sensors)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">serial</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["HotlineBing", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HotlineBing \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/082/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>You don't have Internet connection, but you want to use Bing anyway cuz you're a hopeless Internet addict. \nOr you want to find cheap hotel deals.

We were excited by the social side of AR, and how integrating social networks in real life interactions brings the \"social\" side of social networking back. We wanted to find a way to identify humans through facial tracking/recognition and bring up a known set of social characteristics to augment your interaction. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Once you've talked to a person for a certain amount of time, SocialEyes recognizes and stores their face on the Android app. It groups those faces by person and you then have the ability to connect their face to their Facebook account. From then on, whenever you encounter that person, SocialEyes tracks and recognizes the face and brings up his or her information in a HUD environment. SocialEyes can even tell you the persons heart rate as you are talking to them. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We tuned Haar cascades trained for finding faces in OpenCV to locate the positions of heads in space from the view of the camera of our Meta Augmented Reality (AR) Headset. If we've never seen the face before, we send the face to our back end, which can be accessed and edited using our companion Android app. From here, faces are sent to Azure, where they are grouped using Project Oxford. The groups can be tagged using our Android app, and then linked to Facebook using the Facebook API. The next time that we see the face, we can send the face to our back end, which then sends the face to Azure for identification (among the different tagged face groups we've accumulated). The back end transmits information about the person originally grabbed from the Facebook API back to the computer running the headset, which then displays the information on the AR headset next to the identified person's head. </p>\n<p>At the same time, we also calculated heart rates of subjects given only the AR headset's video feed using eulerian magnification, a technique originally developed in MIT's Computer Science and Artificial intelligence laboratory. We captured groups of pixels located on people's foreheads located using a combination of Haar cascades for the eyes and head. We then manipulated these captured groups of pixels using a signal processing library (part of OpenMDAO) for calculation of the subject's heart rates (after a small calibration period).</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The scope of this project presented the most issues--we were working on basically three different project that all had to come together and function smoothly. Latency was easily the largest issue we had that covered all three projects. We had to use computer vision to detect and track heads in the frame, while simultaneously updating the UI and sending off our images for external processing in Azure. Concurrently, we had to find the heart rate through image processing. We were also working with a Meta kit that is still only for developers, so there are limitations on things like field of view and resolution that we had to work around. The facial tracking had</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're most proud of the sheer complexity of this project. There was so much to do on so many different platforms that we couldn't be sure anything would work together smoothly. Because it was so multifaceted, we had to work evenly as a team and strategically divide up tasks, so we're also proud of how well the team worked together. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Azure and Facebook Graph API, which were both instrumental in our project's success. We had to learn a lot in a very short amount of time, but both ended up working flawlessly with our product. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SocialEyes AR</h2>\n<p>What's most exciting about this project is the interaction between AR and humans. AR headsets can only augment reality so much without interacting with humans, and we think this is the next step in human-to-tech interaction. Five or ten years down the road, this is the kind of thing that will humanize Artificial Intelligence--the ability to identify and \"know\" a human being by face.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">faceapi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">social</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["All aspects of computer vision in the project (head detection, forehead detection, face tracking, then signal processing on detected areas); Parallelized processes as to not block requests; Created C#  Python interop", "Unity UI, and C# scripting (tracking and overlay).", "Developed the full-featured Android app with integration with Facebook Graph API and Project Oxford.

We wanted to build a virtual reality in which all the people in our reality could see each other and interact with each other- potentially from across the globe. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We built a dueling game in Unity in which two players may join the same game over the internet and duel in virtual reality. Using the Kinect allowed us to render virtual bodies of both players in the game, which both of the players can see. The players can fire shots at each other in a friendly duel by touching their left or right elbow with the opposite hand. All in all, we combined functionality of the Kinect with the Samsung Gear in order to create a prototype of a truly immersive VR experience.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We developed our game in Unity. We used Unity-Kinect plugins to gather data from the connect in the Unity framework. The Kinect sends data to the computer, which reads in each vertex of the Kinect's representation of the player's body. These vectors are transferred to the Samsung phone via Open Sound Control. The phone then creates an avatar for the player in game, with the camera centered on the player's head. The Samsung Gear controls the direction of the camera. We used the Photon plugin for Unity to create online multiplayer functionality in our game. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into trouble using the Samsung Gear to control the camera as the Gear seems to initialize the camera direction based on the it's position at the moment the app starts. This meant that the Kinect and the Gear's ideas of the player's orientation were not always the same.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of our integration of VR and Kinect; specifically, getting both Open Sound Control and Photon to integrate with Unity in order to transfer information between the Kinect, the computer, and the Gear. It was important to us that the Gear and Computer communicate locally over the local Wifi network, but that the Gear could also connect with other Gears anywhere in the world, and we succeeded in implementing these goals.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We definitely learned about connecting devices with Open Sound Control, and about creating multiplayer Unity games with Photon.

Transmission occurs through contact with fluids from the sores of the infected person during oral, anal, and vaginal sex; transmission can occur in asymptomatic carriers. HSV-2 is a global public health issue with an estimated 400 million people infected worldwide and 20 million new cases annually - 1/3 of which take place Africa (2012). HSV-2 will increase the risk of acquiring HIV by 3 fold, profoundly affect the psychological well being of the individual, and pose as a devastating neonatal complication. The social ramifications of HSV-2 are enormous. The social stigma of sexual transmitted diseases (STDs) and the taboo of confiding others means that patients are often left on their own, to the detriment of their sexual partners. In Africa, the lack of healthcare professionals further exacerbates this problem. Further, the 2:1 ratio of female to male patients is reflective of the gender inequality where women are ill-informed and unaware of their partners' condition or their own. Most importantly, the symptoms of HSV-2 are often similar to various other dermatological issues which are less severe, such as common candida infections and inflammatory eczema. It's very easy to dismiss Genital Herpes as these latter conditions which are much less severe and non-contagious.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our team from Johns Hopkins has developed the humanitarian solution \u201cForesight\u201d to tackle the taboo issue of STDs. Offered free of charge, Foresight is a cloud-based identification system which will allow a patient to take a picture of a suspicious skin lesion with a smartphone and to diagnose the condition directly in the iOS app. We have trained the computer vision and machine-learning algorithm, which is downloaded from the cloud, to differentiate between Genital Herpes and the less serious eczema and candida infections.</p>\n<p>We have a few main goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove the taboo involved in treating STDs by empowering individuals to make diagnostics independently through our computer vision and machine learning algorithm.</li>\n<li>Alleviate specialist shortages</li>\n<li>Prevent misdiagnosis and to inform patients to seek care if necessary</li>\n<li>Location service allows for snapshots of local communities and enables more potent public health intervention</li>\n<li>Protects the sexual relationship between couples by allowing for transparency- diagnose your partner!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We first gathered 90 different images of 3 categories (30 each) of skin conditions that are common around the genital area: \"HSV-2\", \"Eczema\", and \"Yeast Infections\". We realized that a good way to differentiate between these different conditions are the inherent differences in texture, which are although subtle to the human eye, very perceptible via good algorithms. ] We take advantage of the Bag of Words model common in the field of Web Crawling and Information Retrieval, and apply a similar algorithm, which is written from scratch except for the feature identifier (SIFT). The algorithm follows:</p>\n<p>Part A) Training the Computer Vision and Machine Learning Algorithm (Python)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We use a Computer Vision feature identifying algorithm called SIFT to process each image and to identify \"interesting\" points like corners and other patches that are highly unique</li>\n<li>We consider each patch around the \"interesting\" points as textons, or units of characteristic textures</li>\n<li>We build a vocabulary of textons by identifying the SIFT points in all of our training images, and use the machine learning algorithm k-means clustering to narrow down to a list of 1000 \"representative\" textons</li>\n<li>For each training image, we can build our own version of a descriptor by representation of a vector, where each element of the vector is the normalized frequency of the texton. We further use tf-idf (term frequency, inverse document frequency) optimization to improve the representation capabilities of each vector. (all this is manually programmed)</li>\n<li>Finally, we save these vectors in memory. When we want to determine whether a test image depicts either of the 3 categories, we encode the test image into the same tf-idf vector representation, and apply k-nearest neighbors search to find the optimal class. We have found through experimentation that k=4 works well as a trade-off between accuracy and speed.</li>\n<li>We tested this model with a randomly selected subset that is 10% the size of our training set and achieved 89% accuracy of prediction!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part B) Ruby on Rails Backend</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The previous machine learning model can be expressed as an aggregate of 3 files: cluster centers in SIFT space, tf-idf statistics, and classified training vectors in cluster space</li>\n<li>We output the machine learning model as csv files from python, and write an injector in Ruby that inserts the trained model into our PostgreSQL database on the backend</li>\n<li>We expose the API such that our mobile iOS app can download our trained model directly through an HTTPS endpoint. </li>\n<li>Beyond storage of our machine learning model, our backend also includes a set of API endpoints catered to public health purposes: each time an individual on the iOS app make a diagnosis, the backend is updated to reflect the demographic information and diagnosis results of the individual's actions. This information is visible on our web frontend.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part C) iOS app</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The app takes in demographic information from the user and downloads a copy of the trained machine learning model from our RoR backend once</li>\n<li>Once the model has been downloaded, it is possible to make diagnosis even without internet access</li>\n<li>The user can take an image directly or upload one from the phone library for diagnosis, and a diagnosis is given in several seconds</li>\n<li>When the diagnosis is given, the demographic and diagnostic information is uploaded to the backend</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Part D) Web Frontend</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our frontend leverages the stored community data (pooled from diagnoses made from individual phones) accessible via our backend API</li>\n<li>The actual web interface is a portal for public health professionals like epidemiologists to understand the STD trends (as pertaining to our 3 categories) in a certain area. The heat map is live.</li>\n<li>Used HTML5,CSS3,JavaScript,jQuery</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It is hard to find current STD prevalence incidence data report outside the United States. Most of the countries have limited surveilliance data among African countries, and the conditions are even worse among stigmatized diseases. We collected the global HSV-2 prevalence and incidence report from World Health Organization(WHO) in 2012. Another issue we faced is the ethical issue in collecting disease status from the users. We were also conflicted on whether we should inform the user's spouse on their end result. It is a ethical dilemma between patient confidentiality and beneficence.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We successfully built a cloud-based picture recognition system to distinguish the differences between HSV-2, yeast infection and eczema skin lesion by machine learning algorithm, and the accuracy is 89% for a randomly selected test set that is 10% the training size.</li>\n<li> Our mobile app which provide users to anonymously send their pictures to our cloud database for recognition, avoid the stigmatization of STDs from the neighbors.</li>\n<li>As a public health aspect, the function of the demographic distribution of STDs in Africa could assist the prevention of HSV-2 infection and providing more medical advice to the eligible patients.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned much more about HSV-2 on the ground and the ramifications on society. We also learned about ML, computer vision, and other technological solutions available for STD image processing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Foresight</h2>\n<p>Extrapolating our workflow for Machine Learning and Computer Vision to other diseases, and expanding our reach to other developing countries.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["idea inspiration", "Building and Thinking", "I worked on the front-end development + logo design.", "Hacker and idea"]], ["Insight", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XyDBznnTUqk?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Insight \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/383/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Insight \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/438/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Inspiration and Product</h1>\n<p>There's a certain feeling we all have when we're lost.

Users open the app, and, if logging in with Facebook or Office 365, proceed through the standard OAuth flow, all on-phone. Users can also opt to skip the authentication process with either provider (in which case they forfeit the option to integrate Facebook events or Office365 calendar events into their views).</p>\n<p>After sign in (assuming the user grants permission for use of these resources), and upon startup of the camera, requests are sent with the user's current location to a central server on an Ubuntu box on Azure. The server parses that location data, and initiates a multithread Node process via Windows 2012 R2 instances. These processes do the following, and more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Geospatial radial search schemes with data from Bing</li>\n<li>Location detail API calls from Bing Spatial Query APIs</li>\n<li>Review data about relevant places from a slew of APIs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the data is all present on the server, it's combined and analyzed, also on R2 instances, via the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Haversine calculations for distance measurements, in accordance with radial searches</li>\n<li>Heading data (to make client side parsing feasible)</li>\n<li>Condensation and dynamic merging - asynchronous cross-checking from the collection of data which events are closest</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ubuntu brokers and manages the data, sends it back to the client, and prepares for and handles future requests.</p>\n<h2>Other Notes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The most intense calculations involved the application of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula\" rel=\"nofollow\">Haversine formulae</a>, i.e. for two points on a sphere, the central angle between them can be described as:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img alt=\"Haversine 1\" data-canonical-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/5/a/15ab0df72b9175347e2d1efb6d1053e8.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--oivGsKYc--/https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/5/a/15ab0df72b9175347e2d1efb6d1053e8.png\"/></p>\n<p>and the distance as:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Haversine 2\" data-canonical-url=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/5/055b634f6fe6c8d370c9fa48613dd7f9.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--ohj5YGxe--/https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/5/5/055b634f6fe6c8d370c9fa48613dd7f9.png\"/></p>\n<p>(the result of which is non-standard/non-Euclidian due to the Earth's curvature). The results of these formulae translate into the placement of locations on the viewing device.</p>\n<p>These calculations are handled by the Windows R2 instance, essentially running as a computation engine. All communications are RESTful between all internal server instances.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>iOS and rotation</em>: there are a number of limitations in iOS that prevent interaction with the camera in landscape mode (which, given the need for users to see a wide field of view). For one thing, the requisite data registers aren't even accessible via daemons when the phone is in landscape mode. This was the root of the vast majority of our problems in our iOS, since we were unable to use any inherited or pre-made views (we couldn't rotate them) - we had to build all of our views from scratch.</li>\n<li><em>Azure deployment specifics with Windows R2</em>: running a pure calculation engine (written primarily in C# with ASP.NET network interfacing components) was tricky at times to set up and get logging data for.</li>\n<li><em>Simultaneous and asynchronous analysis</em>: Simultaneously parsing asynchronously-arriving data with uniform Node threads presented challenges. Our solution was ultimately a recursive one that involved checking the status of other resources upon reaching the base case, then using that knowledge to better sort data as the bottoming-out step bubbled up.</li>\n<li><em>Deprecations in Facebook's Graph APIs</em>: we needed to use the Facebook Graph APIs to query specific Facebook events for their locations: a feature only available in a slightly older version of the API. We thus had to use that version, concurrently with the newer version (which also had unique location-related features we relied on), creating some degree of confusion and required care.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>A few of Our Favorite Code Snippets</h2>\n<p>A few gems from our codebase:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>var deprecatedFQLQuery = '...\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>The story</em>: in order to extract geolocation data from events vis-a-vis the Facebook Graph API, we were forced to use a deprecated API version for that specific query, which proved challenging in how we versioned our interactions with the Facebook API.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>addYaleBuildings(placeDetails, function(bulldogArray) {\n    addGoogleRadarSearch(bulldogArray, function(luxEtVeritas) {\n        ...\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>The story</em>: dealing with quite a lot of Yale API data meant we needed to be creative with our naming...</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code>// R is the earth's radius in meters\nvar a = R * 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt((Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(latitude2 - latitude1) / 2) * Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(latitude2 - latitude1) / 2) + Math.cos((Math.PI / 180)(latitude1)) * Math.cos((Math.PI / 180)(latitude2)) * Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(longitude2 - longitude1) / 2) * Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(longitude2 - longitude1) / 2))), Math.sqrt(1 - (Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(latitude2 - latitude1) / 2) * Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(latitude2 - latitude1) / 2) + Math.cos((Math.PI / 180)(latitude1)) * Math.cos((Math.PI / 180)(latitude2)) * Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(longitude2 - longitude1) / 2) * Math.sin((Math.PI / 180)(longitude2 - longitude1) / 2);)));\n</code></pre>\n<p><em>The story</em>: while it was shortly after changed and condensed once we noticed it's proliferation, our implementation of the Haversine formula became cumbersome very quickly. Degree/radian mismatches between APIs didn't make things any easier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing\">bing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-maps\">bing-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bing-geolocation</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yale-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hack-int-elligence/insight\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hack-int-elligence/insight\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://insight-app.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://insight-app.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>insight-app.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Built calculation engines for Haversine geospatial computation layer with Azure Windows R2/C#, handled asynchronous parsing and sorting operations for incoming geodata streams with Node, and contributed to the overall outbound data API layer.", "I worked on the backend Node API server, leveraged parallelism to vastly improve batch request processing time.

We wanted to address this problem by providing an accurate and inexpensive way for everyone to get the most out of their meeting's minutes.</p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>Our hack uses Kinect Voice and Beam angle recognition to take in details of the vocals of a meeting. Using FTP technology, that recording is then sent to a web server which runs a Microsoft Oxford-based transcription algorithim that converts the speech into text. The raw text then branches off into two paths: The first takes live transcript files from parts to the meeting and outputs them in real-time into a OneNote notebook, which can be shared with everyone  involved in the meeting, even though they may not be physially there. The data also travels through a self-made natural language processing algorithm, to extract the important highlights of the meeting. After it is processed, the summary is stored in a MongoDB database. From there the summary is posted to the same OneNote file for each of the meeting members to edit, and review, while keeping the original audio and transcript on record. The meeting is also automatically posted to the Google Calendars of involved employees for easy future reference.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built the Meeting Minutes program using a wide variety of software programs, languages, and operating systems. \nThe sound and relative location data comes straight from the Microsoft Kinect, through the Kinect SDK. Using Visual Studio on Windows OS in C++, the audio is saved and split into smaller segments that are fed through a FTP server powered by Python to the voice processing, transcription, and NLP hub on MacOS. After the data is processed and ready for publishing, it is transferred using a MongoDB database an Ubuntu machine running a Java applet that uses the OneNote API to transfer the data into notebooks. Finally, the Google Calendar segment of the program ties it all together by automatically adding new meetings to the calendar of everyone involved, and places a link to the OneNote notebook.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge was probably the compatibility issues across all of the API, OS, and programming language implementations in our project. Due to the limited functionalities of certain APIs in certain languages, converting all of our data and passing it around through a long processing chain was very difficult. We also ran into signnificant technical difficulties invovling a teammate's computer, which we had to navigate around to make our solution work. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are really proud of how well the team came together to take on our programming challenge, given that we represent 3 different universities, and have never worked together before. We celebrated every connection that we managed to create in our long link a real-world need in inefficient minutes, and </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>It's really surprising how much a team of well-rounded individuals with distinct strengths and weaknesses can accomplish compared to one person alone, even if they were given 10x the time. It is really astounding to see the amount of resources that technology companies provide to developers, and it only takes an idea and a little bit of initiative to create something amazing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Meeting Minutes</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-calendar\">google-calendar</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/onenote\">onenote</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">realtime</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intellij-idea\">intellij-idea</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maven\">maven</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wit-ai\">wit.ai</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["YHacks Adventure", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"YHacks Adventure \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/635/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired to make a text adventure based on Yale's campus and were inspired to take on Datto's challenge and make it less than 4 kb.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows user to travel around Yale's campus and interact with characters and objects to make it to Yale's award ceremony.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Python.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Keeping the source code under four kilobytes.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Successfully uploading then accessing the game's data online.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to store game assets online and fetch them in real time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for YHacks Adventure</h2>\n<p>A graphical user interface to allow better immersion for the user.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://energyglobe.paperplane.io/YHack/adventure.py\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://energyglobe.paperplane.io/YHack/adventure.py\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>energyglobe.paperplane.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["EventLine", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>EventLine queries the largest event database and booking website in the world - EventBrite.

I'd wait to check the bus schedules to see how fast I'd have to run in order to catch the next bus. But it was a real hassle to open the app, let the data load, and check the routes and stops. It seemed more complicated than it should be, despite its attempt at making it easier for us.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We attempted at building an iOS and Android application which allows a user to log in and access their personal course schedules. With these course schedules, the app would know when the user's class is, where it takes place, and based on where the user currently is, a route which took into account the time needed to get to the nearest bus stop, catch the next bus, and be able make it to class right on time. Also, as a convenience feature, we built widgets on iOS and a notification system for Android which displays the nearest bus stop and it's routes right for easy access.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used XCode to build the iOS widget, Android-Studio for the App, and Windows Azure for data management services. We used Yale and Rutger's buses and courses API in order to retrieve content for our app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into challenges with both the Yale Developer API and Windows Azure in our development of this hack. As first time users, it took longer than it should have to set up simple tasks such as user log in, and database access through the application.\nWe also ran into the problem of getting the course schedules to load.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) tests are used to detect seizures and other abnormalities associated with the electrical functions of the brain. With the exception of transitioning from analog recording methods developed in the 1960s to digital recordings in the 1980s, the use of EEG recordings has remained largely unchanged. Learning how to read EEG studies historically requires significant medical training and years of disciplined study. The result is that converting EEG data into clinically meaningful applications is costly and oftentimes inaccurate. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Blaze Bot is an automated editing platform designed to reduce the amount of time it takes to read and identify seizure activity within an EEG recording.

With its rich visuals and exotic settings, the visuals game seemed like an adventure indeed. Our team sought to recreate this experience in immersive virtual reality using the Samsung Gear VR headset, but we thought we could make the experience even cooler by incorporating motion control using the Kinect--after all, what's more realistic than running through a jungle and actually jumping and swerving to avoid obstacles? Thus, Kinect Run 4D was born.Combined with virtual reality and motion control technologies, your entire body is brought inside of a virtual world for a thrilling adventure that puts your reflexes to the test.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using the Microsoft Kinect, we track a player's movement--translating jumps and leans in either direction into signals that we process. Body movements are translated to your virtual doppelganger which reacts to the surrounding environment--moving from side to side or up and down accordingly to jump over rivers and race down a mountain.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The game works by connecting data from the Microsoft Kinect to an Android application which runs the game engine.</p>\n<p>Using a C# Console Application, we parse Kinect motion data and log signals for jumping and leaning in either directions in an output file. A simple Python script reads this file, opens a Bluetooth socket connection, and transmits these signals. On the other end of the connection, an Android application, built with the Unity 3D Mobile engine, receives these signals and translates them into the appropriate motion. The map/setting displayed in-game (picture included) is an original creation too--designed and built entirely within the Unity engine.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The game is one giant integration challenge. The Kinect has to integrate with a Bluetooth transmitter; the Unity 3D engine has to work with calls to the Android API to read the Bluetooth connection. Multiple scripts in multiple languages were necessary to glue everything together. Moreover, implementing the physics necessary to make the game work was a feat in and of itself!</p>\n<h2>Final remarks</h2>\n<p>Our team has had an amazing experience at YHack, and we've thoroughly enjoyed the chance to get to work with virtual reality technology and motion control. None of us had any experience working with either types of technology before this weekend, and we're proud of what we've been able to learn in just 36 hours.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/samsung-gear\">samsung-gear</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sw5813/TempleRunVR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sw5813/TempleRunVR\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["HackWithMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackWithMe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/530/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackWithMe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/540/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Have you ever come to a hackathon thinking, \u201coh crap!

Oftentimes people find themselves in situations of potential danger, whether it's travelling home after work or indeed when going out at the weekend. Our goal for this weekend was to develop a mobile application that allows users to pre-select people from their contact list and in a situation of danger can send a text message to all of these people, alerting them of their need for help along with their location all at the click of a single button. We wanted to encourage community involvement in protecting each other by also notifying other users of the app who are in close proximity. Moving forward, we feel that the optimal experience for users would be to not only have the capability to select their closest friends and family, but if anyone on their contact list is in a nearby area when they hit the button, then their friends who they may not have pre-selected will also be notified by push notifications. We hope that through BuzzMate and other apps we hope to make, we can at least help a few people who would benefit from having an efficient and reliable system to alert their loved ones of potential danger.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LucasStinchcombe/BuzzMate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LucasStinchcombe/BuzzMate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["DISCOVR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DISCOVR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/301/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DISCOVR \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/302/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DISCOVR \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/303/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DISCOVR \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/304/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The three of us were attending our first-ever hackathon and wanted to create something interesting for the purpose of learning.

Our initial plan\ninvolved using text analysis to generate the appropriate music given a particular story\u2019s tone. We\ndecided, however, to move in the direction of actually conducting music when we realized that\nwe had hardware such as Kinect available to us.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>At its core, ConductMe is about allowing the user to become a conductor of his own music.\nOneDrive and relies on input from Unity/Visual Studio. The web app displays a visualizer that app was constructed using Node.js; we used libraries that included Express, Busboy, Node\u00adSass,\nproject; one consisted of researching a way to accurately calculate the BPM (beats\u00adper\u00adminute)\nthat relied on filtering for only lower\u00adfrequency notes, identifying clusters of notes, and\ncalculating how often these clusters appeared. This was done by taking the raw data for the song\nand passing it through the HTML5 Web Audio API. This was especially interesting because it\nrevealed the sophistication of the new HTML5 APIs, and it seems like an inspiring future for\nhigh\u00adquality media apps on the web.</p>\n<p>ConductMe uses the Kinect Motion Capture to track the velocity of a user\u2019s hand and calculate\nthe BPM at which he or she is conducting. The measured value is then used to adjust the speed\nat which the music is being played at. ConductMe aims to give users more control over the\nplayback of their music, allowing them to experience music more interactively.</p>\n<h2>Construction</h2>\n<p>The final product consists of a web app for both the client and server ends that integrates with\nallows users to see the progression and rhythm of the song as it plays; OneDrive was used to\nstore music files, and Unity/Visual Studio was used to process input from the Kinect. The web\nJade, and more. We used the standard libraries in Unity/Visual Studio to parse input and\ncommunicate with our web app; web sockets were created in both the web app and Visual Studio\nfor data transfer.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Only one person had experience with Node.js, and none had experience with any other SDKs\nthat were used; this in itself posed a challenge for us. There were two major components to this\nof a song, and the other consisted of constructing a web app to both play songs and interact with\nusers to speed up and slow down playback.</p>\n<p>Calculating the BPM posed a challenge for several reasons; the first and foremost is that music\nformats don\u2019t expose lower\u00adlevel song properties (e.g. BPM!). Eventually, we found a method\n\nConstructing the web app was more straightforward but involved more work; we had to build a\nweb app using Node that would post audio files to the server, where the server would store and\nanalyze the files, sending the results back to the client who would appropriately respond and\nchange playback.</p>\n<p>Most challenging of all was working with Kinect. The majority of the issues we had while\nbeginning was getting set\u00adup and becoming familiar with the environment; because of the slow\ninternet (to say the least) and the number and size of SDKs that we had to install to grab input\nfrom the Kinect, we weren\u2019t able to start working with the Kinect until about twelve hours into\nthe hackathon. Moreover, after spending a few hours with Unity paring down useless objects\nand writing VB code to parse Kinect input, we found that Unity continually crashed; it became necessary to restart Unity after every single test we ran.\ntactics and resolving merge conflicts.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Most of what we learned consisted of gaining experience in APIs and languages that we had\nnever used before. It was the first time that any of us had seen C#, Visual Studio, and Unity, and\nmost of us had little to no experience with web development, let alone Node.js and its libraries.</p>\n<p>We ran into quite a few Git issues as well and were able to learn more about version control</p>\n<h2>What's next for ConductMe</h2>\n<p>ConductMe can be applied for both recreational and educational purposes. It can help rising\nensemble. For the general public, it allows people to adjust music speed, fast forwarding and\nslowing down at their leisure with a small wave of the hand. This could have applications to\naudio files of all types. For example, students could use ConductMe to easily play audio lectures\nMore hand signals could also be integrated into the ConductMe program. A closed fist could\nsignal the program to pause the audio and an open hand could signal the program to play. A\nwaving hand could be used to switch to the next song.\n\nConductors gain awareness of the impact their gestures have on the speed and volume of the\naloud at 2x speed.</p>\n<p>ConductMe could be influential beyond the audio world if we can link it to the video file as well as the audio . ConductMe would then empower the user to control playing speed of videos as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://git.patrickpan.com/patrick/conductme2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://git.patrickpan.com/patrick/conductme2\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>git.patrickpan.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on user testing and the conducting experience.

In fact, we estimate that we probably spend upwards of 4-5 hours every week watching movies. Like most people, we sometime end up watching movies that are just awful. We wanted to remedy this problem, so we made MyMDb.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>From a user's perspective, MyMDb gives them the ability to visualize their movie interests in a way that makes it fast and easy for them to find new movies to enjoy. They first enter a movie they like, then a big graph emerges which they can explore. By clicking the nodes (which represent movies), they can grow the graph and concomitantly, their movie knowledge. Behind the scenes, it uses IMDbPy to grab movie data from IMDb, and D3 data visualization library to render the graph to users.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We decided to use Django on the back-end for its quick development time, and we used VanillaJS, a little bit of JQuery, and D3 on the front-end. Here's how the app works:  first, the user enters a seminal movie which we send to our server, which responds with a list of similar movies. In this way the app creates the root node along with the first leaves. After that, any click on any leaf will trigger a new subgraph to grow using the same method. In addition, whenever a node is clicked, the front-end queries the server for detailed information on the movie, which gets displayed to the user alongside the graph.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Neither of us had used Django or D3 extensively, so we ran into a lot of minor bugs that took us way too long to fix. One of us also missed the bus here, and got in late on Saturday. So we didn't get the chance to sleep on Saturday. We also had to prioritize which features we wanted to implement before the 8:30 deadline.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We think our app looks beautiful while simultaneously solving a big problem in a novel way.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned never to trust bus drivers. We also learned, more importantly, how important good design is--once we added styling to our app, it almost seemed to function better. We also learned how difficult it becomes to program after 24 hours of nonstop coding. Finally, we mentioned that we were challenged by the need to prioritize features given the short development time. We think this was a beneficial challenge, as it actually forced us to discard many distracting features that would have made the product more difficult to use.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MyMDb</h2>\n<p>We plan to make the app change the sizes of the the nodes based on an aggregate \"movie goodness score,\" which--hopefully--we can tailor to users who frequent the website. We think the differential sizing will make it even easier for users to identify good movies.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">imdbpy</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/JeffreyTerry/MyMDb\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/JeffreyTerry/MyMDb\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Tabasco", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tabasco \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/402/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tabasco \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/403/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Tabasco is a humanitarian project aimed to help victims of disasters.

Several days later I had a flash of \"original inspiration\" which I was sure I'd never considered before, at least until the aforementioned friends convinced me that I was repeating myself. </p>\n<p>After a rough start at YHack, I decided I was going to implement this idea. By the time I started it was already close to the deadline. It was a scramble to finish on time, but it came together in the end. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>TextFLIX lets you watch Netflix in your text editor or terminal. It's perfect for elitist sysadmins and GUI-haters everywhere. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>TeXTFLIX is more than just a Netflix client; it's actually a window into your browser. Using the Chrome screen-capture API, a custom Chrome Extension pipes frames to the server (a python script) through a WebSocket, where they are rendered as full ansi-colored text and sent out to all connected telnet clients. Technically it could be used for any website, but Netflix is a perfect use-case.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Stdout is slow. Super slow. Really killed my FPS. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Made this thing in 5-ish hours while being sleep deprived.

When speaking with them about the biggest problem currently facing veterans, they were unanimous in describing the inefficiencies of the healthcare and assistance systems that are available to veterans. In this way, we took on the challenge of simplifying the entire veteran help process by streamlining appointment scheduling, granting digital resource access through a personal assistant UI, and adding additional frameworks for future integration by the VA that so desperately needs to move into the digital age.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>-Serves as a foundation for health assistance via digital access to physical, mental, and emotional help\n-Priority scheduler (based on severity) for the VA to utilize\n-Geolocation and voice commands for user accessibility\n-Provides instant resources for mental challenges such as depression, anxiety, and family issues\n-Allows veterans to access a network of applications such as auto-generating healthcare vouchers and requesting care reimbursement</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used Java on the mobile avenue to build a native Android application. Using Google Voice Recognition, we process user speech inputs with our own NLP systems that takes into account context to determine response. We then push that response back out with TTS for a personal assistant experience. On the web side, we're using Django to run and host an SQLite database to which we send user data when they need to schedule a VA appointment.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We couldn't find a suitable nlp api to employ that understood our context, so we had to create our own.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Assist</h2>\n<p>We anticipate an opportunity for this app to grow in capabilities as new policies push for system reform. We developed not only several front-end capabilities and useful tools that are instantly usable, but also a framework for future integration into the VA's system for the automation and digitalization of complicated paper processes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I wrote the backend using Django and styled the frontend using CSS, learning Django and MVC development along the way.", "", "", ""]], ["crAIg", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"crAIg \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/358/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"crAIg \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/367/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>After reading a paper called NEAT: Evolving Increasingly Complex Neural Network Topologies published out of the University of Texas in 2000, we were inspired to test the limits of the algorithm by creating an implementation to learn one of our favourite classic games, Super Mario Bros. We've always found the concepts of machine learning and artificial intelligence incredibly interesting, so when we realized we could combine that passion with our love for games, we jumped at the opportunity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>crAIg starts out as an effectively blank canvas. He is dropped into level 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. with no knowledge of the game itself, what the game's goal is, or how to play. He has but one evolutionary instinct - to survive. crAIg 'breeds' himself using the algorithms and techniques explained in NEAT. Thousands of different crAIg iterations are created, each identified by their complex web of virtual neurons and synapses. These neurons are mapped to the tile locations on the game screen which are read through an emulator, and are connected through other neurons and synapses to the potential outputs for crAIg, the buttons on the controller. The life of the crAIgs is short and exciting, if they are not able to continually progress through the level, their genome is deemed inferior and its chance of reproduction slims. Through this process, stronger and more intelligent crAIgs continue to breed with each other, as happens in natural evolution, and eventually, an alpha species can prevail.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We build crAIg largely through the Lua scripting language. Lua is an ideal language for interacting with a classic game like Super Mario Bros., as many emulators support interfacing with it. We used an open source emulator called FCEUX to build and test crAIg. The front end for the app was built using a node.js server with Socket.io integration. crAIg periodically saves his status as JSON files which are read by the server, passed to the client through websockets, and displayed to the user through d3. This allows us to better understand crAIg's brain as it gives a visual representation for what he is 'thinking'. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Challenges in this project were frequent and occasionally frustrating. One of the largest issues we ran into was various quirks with the Lua language and the environment which we had to test it through. When we wanted to test crAIg in action, the only way to do so is by running the script through the emulator. Unfortunately, the emulator lacks any script debugging tools outside of a console, making bugfixing a tiresome process. Additionally, FCEUX is very old software, originally published in 2000, causing us to run into memory issues which were difficult to diagnose. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>While crAIg is unable to clear a full level yet, we are confident he soon will be able to. His progress throughout the level is evident, as each successful iteration he appears smarter and tends to make it further.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a significant amount through crAIg's development. Having never had any experience with Lua, both of us are proud to say we have a new language under our belts. We also learned a considerable amount about machine learning and neural networks, knowledge we hope to be able to use in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for crAIg</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joenot443/crAIg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joenot443/crAIg\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Lens", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Lens \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/931/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Lens \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/933/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Lens \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/934/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Lens \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/935/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are in a very social connected world, and that is a goldmine of information for companies to look at to find data.

Slow check-ins, reminders, packing are annoying enough - not to mention stay on airline websites for hours to find a reasonable price. We decided to use JetBlue's api to put some transparency into the system - one that we think will benefit both parties.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Aria is an intelligent travel agent that uses your already available data (social media, past purchases, friends, etc.) to determine and recommend flight packages to the customer. Based on keywords (say you want to find a romantic destination... but also on a budget of $600), we slowly filter the list of available flights through a seamless and natural human conversation.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we have the ability to plan trips between people, and bring them in on the conversation with Aria, regardless of their departing destination. Being in a long distance relationship can be hard, and current trip planners never account from multi-destination points. We used Facebook to easily leverage your personal and social data to fly easily with your friends (or girlfriend/boyfriend).</p>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges to airlines today is filling the remaining 15% of airplanes. Unfortunately standby tickets are largely unavailable to the general public due to more restrictive rules at customs, leading to longer waiting times. We created the Aria's purchasing system to allow two kinds of ticket purchasers - a commited buyer, and an \"aria flyer\". Commited buyers are able to purchase and use the tickets on the day of, while Aria flyers choose to join group flights that they only have to commit to if it reaches the group minimum. It's a great way to encourage spontaneous travelling and customer engagement.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the MEAN stack to shell out most of our application. Our team split in half to develop front-end and back-end, because each was vital to creating a \"human experience\".</p>\n<p>Front-end used Sketch, Photoshop, Skeleton, HTML/CSS/Javascript + JQuery and Google Chrome DevTools (&lt;3) to hash out most of our prototyping.</p>\n<p>Back-end used MongoDB, Node, Express, and the Jetblue APIs alongside experimental Machine Learning functions to help us understand Natural Language Processing. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Aria - Concierge AI Travel Agency</h2>\n<p>Stay tuned...</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jetblue</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/expedia\">expedia</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["RPI CIPCE Website for Arduino Program", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RPI CIPCE Website for Arduino Program \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/325/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RPI CIPCE Website for Arduino Program \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/326/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RPI CIPCE Website for Arduino Program \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/327/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The current website for CIPCE, a pre-college education program at RPI, is rather old and outdated.

An overly-negative feed has the potential to cause depression. </p>\n<p>We tackle this problem by scraping users' Facebook feeds and assigning them a negative-positive score using HP's Haven OnDemand Sentiment Analysis API. If this score is too low, we alert the user that their feed may be aversely affecting their mood. We can then replace negative posts with cute gifs (guaranteed to improve anyone's day!) or alert a loved one/therapist about the users' exposure to potentially triggering content. A (subtle) link is provided to reveal the original content.</p>\n<p>Our front-end chrome extension parses each post on the user's Facebook newsfeed, concatenates it with any comments, and passes the text to HP's Sentiment Analysis API to get an aggregate \"positivity\" score. This positivity score is then logged in a MySQL database in one-hour increments, and any trigger-words are identified. The decision to filter a post is calculated based on the last 12 one-hour blocks and the frequency of certain trigger words.</p>\n<p>We experimented with HP's Entity Extraction API to look for specific types of content in the posts, for instance searching for content associated with particular themes that could be a trigger for users, but in the end we didn't have time to integrate the API. Instead, we check for particular triggering themes by searching through the given post text for groups of related words associated with these triggers. This ended up serving us well, giving us a solid categorization of text into different themes of some of the most common triggers in people with past traumatic experiences.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/giphy\">giphy</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dyelax/happme\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dyelax/happme\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Front-end web dev/design.

It could tell you exactly what your image is, top 10 things you could do with that. Not just this. It reads the text within your image and summarizes it for you. Cool isn't it ?</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We harnessed the power of alchemy api to help us understand what actually the image is. Then we ask bing to tell us the top things you could do with the it. If the image has any text we use Microsoft's Project Oxford to extract the text. We then apply some Natural Language Processing (NLP) on it to give us a brief summary. For the server we used Node.js and ionic at the client side.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Angular is great. But like any other Javascript framework it doesn't have the built in ability to make synchronous HTTP calls to the server. That's when we had to make promises to our function by deferring the one already executed.</li>\n<li>Drafting down a summary from huge text using NLP was difficult. The use of underscore.js helped simplify some of the things for us. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 36 hours we have an app that could give us a summary of the long boring article we always hate reading.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft API's are excellent.

Americans spent more than $37 billion on prepaid debit cards in 2010 and billions in gift cards each year. The Android app we created incorporates Venmo payments to allow consumers to combine, access and use funds stored on gift cards as well as on Prepaid VISA Cards in one place. \nAnother problem we sought to address was the fact that as much as 7% of all git cards go unredeemed. For example, if you\u2019re a vegetarian and someone gives you a gift card to a steakhouse, you might find it difficult to use. Mismatches such as these and many more like them have created an accrual of unredeemed gift card spending in our economy. Our project also aims to resolve this inefficiency by creating a forum in which individuals may exchange unwanted gift cards for ones they actually desire. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>merging VISA card accounts/amounts into Venmo for the convenience of centralizing the money from various cards</li>\n<li>hold prepaid debit card info</li>\n<li>keep track of each card</li>\n<li>send it to Venmo account</li>\n<li>inventory of gift cards </li>\n<li>keep a list of arrays with the card balance and codes</li>\n<li>have a \u201ctotal\u201d box to show the total amount</li>\n<li>keep track of remaining balance when it is spent</li>\n<li>swapping gift cards</li>\n<li>community exchange with people with cards that you want/need to swap</li>\n<li>swap card number and security code</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We prioritized the different functionalities and then systematically broke large problems into shorter ones. For example, our first priority was to be able to combine prepaid cards and send to venmo account since it was easier to implement than the giftcard swap system  . We used many object oriented principles to implement all parts of the software.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We had too many features we wanted to implement and too little time. For example, we wanted to implement a security system to prevent fraud but realized that it was less important for now since we are merely trying to build a prototype to showcase the overall idea.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we were able to program an Android application concurrently with learning Android itself (since none of the team members had substantial experience.)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>On the practical side, we learned Android App Development and learned the nuances of Github. However, we also learned something greater; we learned how to work together in a team environment on a large scale project in a short time. We learned how to budget time and set priorities in order to accomplish what is truly important.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AcuCard</h2>\n<p>In our next steps, we hope to find a way to bypass the 3% processing fee in Venmo money transfer, include more companies under gift cards, make purchases and transactions through barcode generation, improve the community for exchange of gift cards, and prevent fraud through transaction holds.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/venmo\">venmo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ErickLin/AccuCard/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ErickLin/AccuCard/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://prezi.com/lwdh43jvgboy/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy&amp;rc=ex0share\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://prezi.com/lwdh43jvgboy/?utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy&amp;rc=ex0share\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>prezi.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["simpoll", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"simpoll \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/134/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"simpoll \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/135/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"simpoll \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/136/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"simpoll \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/137/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"simpoll \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/138/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>simpoll</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Ever wanted to decide where to eat?

It involves placing a camera looking down on a scene while also equipping the robot to be tracked with an infrared LED. Using inverse projection, we are able to accurately track the motion of the robot.\nThe main applications for this project are consumer and industrial robotics. It is useful in the industrial sense because it could enable a fleet of robots to move around a factory floor entirely autonomously, as they would be aware of their position using this system. This would allow for types of automation that aren't possible with traditional factory environments.\nRoboLPS is also very useful in the field of consumer robotics, specifically internet-of-things enabled devices. In order for robots to navigate around a user's home, they need some sort of indoor positioning system. Furthermore, by attaching other sensors to the robots, they can create maps of the environment as they navigate, allowing more efficient path finding by robots afterwards.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AaronPerl/YHack-RoboLPS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AaronPerl/YHack-RoboLPS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["GeoAlarm", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GeoAlarm \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/087/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>YHacks2015</h1>\n<p>GeoAlarm is a web app running on JavaScript that provides the User to enter in a location, name of alarm, and distance to location which will then create a personalized alarm that will alert the user when they get in range of their desired distance from their location.

Whether that's a hack or a vaccine, a novel or a Billboard hit, the drive to make, and make well, is a powerful force. We get it. In addition to being coders, our develops are musicians, writers, teachers, and engineers. We want to help give you and your art all the tools to succeed. Bandmate is a platform to help musicians find each other and work together. There are enough instrumentalists to go around, and we're here to help you find them. Whether you want a bassist in your town to jam with, or a flutist half the world away who also enjoys electro-ska-swing, odds are there are other people who like the same music as you and want to make it.\nWe'll leave the ideas to you. We're just your helpful groupies.\nSo what are you waiting for?</p>\n<p><em>\"After the passing of irresistible music, you must learn to make due with a dripping faucet\"</em> -Jim Harrison</p>\n<p>^^^<strong>Not if we have anything to say about it</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Bandmate</strong> is a matchmaker for musicians. After a user logs in with Facebook and fills out a short survey, we use the instruments they play and the types of music they are interested in making to set them up. Our correlation algorithm (_ Thanks Alex! _) focuses either on similarity of style, or relative location. Users can toggle between the two categories. So if they want to find musicians in their town, they can look at musicians and Bands near them. If they want to find their music soul mates way over in Singapore or South Africa, they can utilize the \"Bands Like Me\" feature. This way, users can get the exact sort of creative experience they want, no matter where or how geographically isolated they are.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Bandmate</strong> was built radiating outward. We started with the js and APIs we knew we needed to call, and then split up, working on the frontend/UI while also creating our user database and writing the correlation algorithm. We divided work well, all playing to our own strengths. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Besides the obvious sleeping struggle, it took us a while to really nail down our vision. We knew generally what functionality we wanted to provide, but ironing out the details took longer than expected.\nWe also struggled with gathering the requisite data from the Facebook API, as we needed to apply as developers and did not have the time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to do a lot very quickly: build a user database,  write an algorithm, learn some new language, create a UI/UX. I know that hackathons are all about agile dev, but this really surprised me. We were able to motivate our team members and keep everyone on task, while having fun. It was a great experience. </p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned so much at this hackathon, and we're really proud of that. Lee started learning Ruby. Claire wrote her first non-bootstrap website. Alex learned about different sorts of music. We all came out of this a little worse for the wear, but better programmers and teammates than we were before.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Bandmate</h2>\n<p>We'd like to incorporate Facebook Music and Spotify to improve our music-taste analysis algorithm's accuracy. We'd also like to get a chat client working, to allow users to communicate with potential bandmates</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/spotify\">spotify</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bandmate-yhack/bandmate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bandmate-yhack/bandmate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bandmate-yhack.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bandmate-yhack.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bandmate-yhack.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["4K Public Canvas", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/088/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/089/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/090/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/091/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/092/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/093/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/095/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"4K Public Canvas \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/318/096/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>MillionPixelHomepage and how people actually bought all the pixels.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It lets people to spend their excess money to draw on a public canvas. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used _ HTML/JS/PHP _ and _ Bootstrap _ to build the website.

We want to know if you can immerse yourself so strongly in a Virtual environment that your sensory perception is affected. Can you _ feel _ the wind from the virtual environment? Ask yourself if you have goosebumps because of how cold the weather is...virtually? We're going to show you ** what the <em>world</em> is feeling. **</h2>\n<h2>What it does; Project HappyMedia interacts with the user on a web application that accesses information about what the world is _ currently _ feeling. On the backend, it is moved into a Database (using Mongodb) and the most current (today's) rating is recalled. It then simulates the feelings of the world into a virtual world using Unity. We create a mood sensitive environment through landforms, weather, time of day, etc. The viewer doesn't get to know the mood of the world until they put on the Oculus and <em>feel</em> the mood of the world. Our Oculus simulation currently runs separate to the web application because we had no access to an Oculus and wouldn't be able to test the functionality of the front end web application if it ran straight to the Oculus.</h2>\n<h2>How I built it; The Oculus environments were built in Unity using Oculus and Unity APIs. The Front end was built using Sublime as a text editor and using MongoDB and Node.js. The API we used to get the global happiness takes people's input all across the world and it updates with respect to the timezones (it updates more than once a day). It is built for mood tracking across the globe. The API also gives us information about the global rate of happiness. For our use of it, it also does update as the happiness factor goes up and down throughout the day.</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into; We ran into a lot of challenges with the database (getting values OUT of the database using indexing in particular). We really wished that MongoDB had a representative that could have assisted us because it seemed like there were some small issues in which we couldn't get enough community support and help with on the internet but they could have quickly resolved. Of course, we cannot reiterate enough how hard it is to try to develop for hardware without having it to debug and test. We were really really interested in using it from the beginning which is why we persisted with the project regardless and we hope it doesn't affect the judging too much that we are not able to provide a full on demo.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of; Every single team member worked with technology and software that was challenging for them as well as our project was definitely challenging for us from the beginning. We knew that it would have been logical to do a web app OR an Oculus simulation and that linking them was going to be very tricky, however, we were passionate that our idea was extremely worthwhile and any progress we make could later be improved and updated. It's definitely an idea that we are proud to work on and want to continue to see through to the finish.</h2>\n<h2>What I learned; We all learned an incredible amount from what we worked with in our separate tasks; Unity, Mongo, Node.js, etc. We also learned a lot about modularizing, not really self motivated but simply because we couldn't build the project seamlessly to work from start to finish without the Oculus. Therefore we had to separate it in a manner that could be stitched together easily at a later date. We definitely learned a lot from the talks and workshops along the way and I think that is a large reason we were so motivated not to give up on the two tasks that are independent of eachother but really do go together to make a set. Simply creating an Oculus Rift/Unity world simulation has been done before. It lacks creativity and purpose and mostly makes use of Unity's terrain builder. On the other hand, a Web app simply returning the happiness rating of the world currently is definitely cool, but how long before you forget about it and never use it? It would make almost no impression whatsoever on the user. It could be as forsaken as checking the weather. Together it stimulates interest, curiosity and mystery about the boundaries of Virtual Reality and human connectivity.</h2>\n<h2>What's next for HappyMedia; We hope to impress the judges with our application of the Oculus Rift API enough to get the DK2 prizes and with that continue to implement our ideas for this. The amount we have done in one weekend on this project is huge, monumental in fact, and if we can work on things at even half the pace we are going to be beta testing in no time. We have high hopes to get something testable by the end of this year and hopefully get some more Unity/Oculus worlds developed as well.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYvs06wx9C9C0TiolTq_40BK0ti3FhBukjGCkP-u7tA/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DYvs06wx9C9C0TiolTq_40BK0ti3FhBukjGCkP-u7tA/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["It was my first time leaning about Node.js and using Mongo (in fact I downloaded it during the hackathon!).

It then uses CSS animations to morph these into randomly coloured bricks at the top of the page. Paddle and ball are spawned right after that, and then a good old fashioned game of Brick Breaker begins!</p>\n<p>Don't worry, those anchor tags aren't actually gone. Simply hit <code>esc</code> and your page is back to normal.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>When building a project with space in mind, you really have to make sure that everything is as self contained as possible. We started out by building a script to do all the animations and the game logic separately, and slowly merged them together into the chrome extension architecture. Once we verified that everything was there and working, the uncompressed source was ~10kb...well over our limit. We optimized where possible, and minified every single file of all whitespace and extraneous characters, using <a href=\"https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS\" rel=\"nofollow\">UglifyJS</a>.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The main crux of our project was that, since it was manipulating the DOM, it used jQuery heavily. However, in order to include jQuery into a chrome extension, it's source needs to be added as a user script. This means that I'll have to lug around a 400kb+ file wherever I went.</p>\n<p>And of course that wouldn't do.</p>\n<p>But since chrome extensions are prevented from injecting scripts (and other tags) from the CSP, I had to get a bit creative. What I ended up doing was making an ajax GET call to the cdn hosting the minified jquery code. The response was simply a single string, and that string was all of the jQuery code, wrapped up in a closure.</p>\n<p>So I did what any sane person would do... and ran <code>eval()</code> on that string.</p>\n<p><em>It worked.</em></p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Once I finally minified all the source and uploaded the extension for testing, it was time to pack it up. Chrome created the <code>.crx</code> executable, and I nervously navigated to my project directory to check it's file size.</p>\n<p><em>3,665 bytes</em></p>\n<p>Now that's a pretty close call. And the fact that I got so close really made me happy. It made me happy because not only was I within the bounds of the challenge, but I successfully picked something complex enough to approach the upper bound without hitting it.

The goal is to introduce some fun features that would use various unique parts of the data: <br/></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p><b>\"I'm feeling adventurous\"</b> - This feature randomly selects a Getaway package from the database. It's great for users who enjoy not knowing what comes ahead!</p></li>\n<li><p><b>\"General Search\"</b> - We ended up not having time to do the front end. It's also very standard.</p></li>\n<li><p><b>\"Subscribe\"</b> - This feature puts the user on a mailing list, but it is adaptive to more\n    specifications. The user may specify a list of fields, and whenever a new \n    Getaway deal is added, we check if the specifications are a match to the\n    user. If so, we email them to check for new deals!</p></li>\n<li><p><b>\"Fun Times\"</b> - We were just having fun here :) It could be adapted as a good marketing \n    strategy though, just not in its current state. You put in your email, your significant other's email, and your name. Both of you will receive a fun message!</p></li>\n<li><p><b>\"Game\" </b> - Test your geography in a fun matching game and unlock great flight deals!</p></li>\n<li><p><b>\"Admin Panel\" </b> - Allows an admin to put new Getaway deals into the DB. Also checks the\n    subscribe list to see if anyone should be notified.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Unfinished Portions</strong> <br/></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>We didn't know how to interpret the advance_weeks field. If advance_weeks means\nthat we only post a certain row at (date - advance_week) time, then we can add a \nflag to hide unreleased rows. The ability to notify subscribers should still work\nsimilarly.</p></li>\n<li><p>We didn't complete the General Search portion of the front end. It wasn't our\ntop priority though, since General Search is too mundane for this cool website!</p></li>\n<li><p>More bug-fixing and bad-case catching</p></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/catzhangy1/esfd_flask\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/catzhangy1/esfd_flask\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["I won the game ... all the time", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>We parsed a few language dictionaries to find all the words that ended with the sufix me, and the searched for interesting available domains among that set of words.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/namecheap\">namecheap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://iwonthega.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://iwonthega.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>iwonthega.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Flight Planner", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flight Planner \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/994/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flight Planner \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/995/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration I wanted to get to make picking flights more enjoyable and intuitive.</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It uses a United states map to interface as places to fly to and fly from</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used lots of stuff!

By Purnima Mehta,  Nikki Sigurdson, Michael O'Connell, Qile Wang</p>\n<p>PURPOSE</p>\n<p>This program could be used by companies to sort through resumes systematically and find the best job candidates based on what's available about the candidate on the internet. </p>\n<p>The way we identify the best candidates is by searching their names and related other key terms (like their location) through the google python API, and then parsing through the data available on relevant search results to see if data from their resume can be backed or supported by what is online about them.</p>\n<p>This project recieves resume information input from the user and parses the resume and then internet search results for relations to key terms from said resume. Data is recieved through a Django web app and then stored in a sqllite3 database.<br/>\nThe whole program is written in python. </p>\n<p>Companies and buisnesses will find this program useful because it allows them to systematically identify the best potential future employees with minimal human intervention. This means less people have to do the dirty work of resume parsing. Events like Hackathons give companies access to more resumes than they can handle by hand anymore.  This program becomes especially important as employers continue to get more and more resume submissions from young people in STEM and IT as we continue in the 21st century. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AroundTheLines/ResearchMe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AroundTheLines/ResearchMe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on creating a database containing all keywords.", "", "", ""]], ["Nevrnote", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Still very much a work in progress, the main goal of this project was just to play with geoIP and get some experience with Express.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/maxtuck21/yhack2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/maxtuck21/yhack2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["SafetyNet", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SafetyNet \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/496/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SafetyNet \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/495/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SafetyNet \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/494/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SafetyNet \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/493/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SafetyNet \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/962/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A couple weeks ago, a threat aimed at our university caused us to ponder current safety protocols and what would happen in the event of an emergency. Some students weren't even aware of the threat as they hadn't seen the e-mail. We felt that today's technology could empower us to react better to emergency situations, and we decided to prototype some of our ideas at YHack 2015.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SafetyNet provides an infrastructure for \"networks\" (college campuses, hospitals, corporate offices) that allows both members and administrators to communicate rapidly and make informed decisions in emergency situations, preventing injury and even saving lives. </p>\n<p>In an emergency situation, dispatchers can activate the emergency alert system, which gives a high-level overview of the situation and the location of all members of the network. The dispatcher can send out specific alerts that will reach members in just seconds, and the system will automatically calculate the fastest route to safety for each member, even when typical routes may be blocked or otherwise dangerous. Firefighters and other first responders can leverage our system to quickly locate those in dire need of help.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The SafetyNet application is built upon a PHP/MySQL back-end, which synchronizes data among all the components of the system. The dispatcher / administrative control panel is a highly-responsive web application powered by Javascript and AJAX requests. The mobile endpoints (the Android app and the ultra-thin web client) were written in Java and Javascript, respectively.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Mobile development took the most time and effort, despite the relative simplicity of the endpoint application. Features like push notifications, which provide speedy communication, and positioning, which provide the valuable location data to dispatchers, took a lot of time to set up and integrate cross-platform.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The dispatcher / administrator control panel turned out very well with regards to design and functionality. We had a daunting task to keep the page in sync with the state of the frequently-updating database, but all of the pieces came together after a bit of hacking.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about how ambitious it is to develop an application that spans multiple platforms. We had originally planned to create interfaces for numerous operating systems and wearables, but were limited to just a few under the 36 hour constraint. Similarly, we learned how flexible web development can be in a cross-platform environment.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SafetyNet</h2>\n<p>We feel that this hack tackles a serious contemporary issue, and we think there is something to learn from what we've created at YHack. This application would likely require a lot of manpower to implement as-is, but it is an interesting concept that could be potentially integrated into future mobile operating systems in an effort to leverage newer technology to help us live better and keep us safe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-maps\">bing-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the structure and content of the main console page and tweaked some of the smaller CSS details towards the end of the project.

The incentive for people to participate in these community service events are generally due to selflessness and love for their community. </p>\n<p>As individuals that attend community service events around our city, we found that there is no one place to find all volunteering opportunities around the area with different organizations all on different services making events around the city hard to find, and thus, the idea of Comm Play was born.

Also, the user can choose to be read the instructions.</p>\n<h2>How it was built</h2>\n<p>WARNING: The following may be extremely technical...proceed with caution :)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A simple node.js and express boilerplate was what the app started with, and mongoose was soon added (the ODM for MongoDB) to perform writes to the database we're hosting in the cloud.</li>\n<li>The BigOven API is used to search for recipes, and also to retrieve the list of ingredients and / or steps to make them.</li>\n<li> The search page simply queries the BigOven API for the search term the user specified, and displays the results.</li>\n<li>In order to sync the web application with the Pebble, a few things needed to be done. For example, when a user navigated to the next step in the web application, the Pebble needed to reflect that change. To accommodate this type of behavior, every time the user went to the home screen, their username was given a <code>user_id</code>, and both of these pieces of information went to the server over <code>socket.io</code>. The server would then remember this client and keep track of the socket it came from. If the user performed an action that took them to a different part of the application, a command was sent through <code>socket.io</code> so that they knew not to disconnect from this client. When a client is disconnected (leaves the webpage, etc.) the MongoDB document that belongs to that client's id would then be deleted. This kept our MongoDB database relatively clean and only held data that was actively being updated and / or retrieved. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>-Another feature we required was that if the step the user was on required a timer, you can start it through pressing a button on the Pebble and a timer would also start on the appropriate client's webpage. To accomplish this, we've included <code>socket.io</code> into the application in order to maintain a channel of communication between the server and client after the page loads, and we've written RESTful HTTP endpoints on our server that the Pebble can get data from. When the button is pressed on Pebble, it makes a POST request to the <code>/api/token/{user-id}</code> endpoint on our web server and tells us the duration of the timer, and if it needed to be created or paused. The web server then sent  this information to the particular client's webpage (determined by hashing the <code>user_id</code> by <code>Socket</code>) which caused a javascript timer to appear in the DOM. In order for the Pebble to know which step the user is on, it made a GET request to the <code>/api/status/{user-id}</code> endpoint once every five seconds. Also, to sync to the correct client Socket initially the Pebble hits the <code>/api/join</code> endpoint on our server. The Pebble specifies which username they'd like to connect to, and the server checks to see if they're in the list of people who are currently connected to it. If they are, the server responds with the user's <code>user-id</code> so that the Pebble can know which client to keep track of in its interface.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our application also can read the steps out loud to you if you would like that, and it was accomplished through nuance's Javascript SDK for Text-to-Speech. This was almost entirely client-side javascript coding.</li>\n<li>The Myo armband is the perfect hardware to control the recipe in the web interface without hands. This is why a script was written for the Myo armband that can changed to a different step, trigger the reading of the step out loud, or view the ingredients again.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest struggle was finding a way for our web application to communicate with the pebble smartwatch. We solved this problem with the through the use of socket.io and MongoDB, but none of us have had experience linking a Pebble to a web app previously. Other challenges include getting the text-to-speech API to start working, styling with bootstrap, and Pebble's limit on size of response data. After a number of google searches, we were able to find answers to all of our questions!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Our success with integration of Pebble Pebble in a web app.</li>\n<li>The ability to seamlessly but appropriately aggregate all of this hardware and software technology to the same application(mongodb + socket.io + pebble + Myo).</li>\n<li>Voice Processing</li>\n<li>API Integration</li>\n<li>Myo Integration</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What we've learned</h2>\n<p>A lot of further web development. The new web technologies include Heroku, Materialize, and socket.io. In summary, how to hack and build something awesome.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Chef-Ware?</h2>\n<p>Introduce this technology to the current and future chefs of the world.

However, for individuals with autism spectrum disorders, it can be very challenging to navigate the feelings of others. Resources already attempt to address this, but as with many mental health services, the global demand is much greater than supply, putting a strain on both the healthcare system and on parents; that's where our app comes in. Requiring nothing more than an Internet connection, I Know That Feel is a free resource that aims to address these issues.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web application allows users to learn to identify and mimic emotional responses through playing facial emotion recognition games. The website is divided into 2 sections: one where children may play the games, and one for parents, where they may monitor their children's scores over time. Its easy to read format and reliance on visuals makes it easy to use for children who may be overwhelmed by visual/auditory stimuli or have difficulties reading.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We created a web application hosted using Azure, using Flask for Python for our backend. Our application relies on the Flickr API to get photos of people with different emotions, along with the Indico machine learning API to detect facial expression from captured photos. We save information about each user's gameplay in a SQLite database which we can then query to return graphical analysis of user stats.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the main challenges for us was getting started with Flask, which none of us had ever used before; we quickly realized that isn't as well-documented as we'd imagined. Furthermore, one of the key components of our application, the Indico facial emotion recognition API, doesn't always work as accurately as we'd hoped; thus, we would love to improve upon our emotion recognition algorithm to make it more precise.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of pulling together to create the app, given the little experience that we had when we started. We are grateful to have been able to design a polished UI that supports both children and parental usage; we feel that the application has significant potential in becoming a valuable resource to benefit young children with developmental disabilities.    </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about how Python, in particular how the Flask framework works, as well as about storing and querying for data through SQLite. We also learned much about the variety of API's that are available for analyzing human sentiment and making human interactions easier.  </p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>One of our original goals was to incorporate text-to-speech and speech-to-text interaction during the games, which would allow us to target a younger audience with more flexibility; after learning about APis such as Nuance and Microsoft's Project Oxford, we hope to be able to expand our application to utilize such abilities. We definitely hope that the application has the opportunity to make a social impact in improving healthcare treatment for children with autism spectrum disorders.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">batchfile</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flickr\">flickr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indico</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hann013/iknowthatfeel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/hann013/iknowthatfeel\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Exgress", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Exgress \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/438/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Exgress \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/444/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The original inspiration came from the popular augmented-reality Android-based game \"Ingress\", in which random strangers around the world team up in factions in the game in order to achieve certain objectives in real life. We took the fundamental augmented-reality (and teamwork!) concept of \"Ingress\" and decided to add a touch of fitness to it, and out came Exgress (Ingress with Exercises, cleaver, we know). </p>\n<p>Just take a quick look at all the sports around you, and it's easy to see that humans simply love to compete. By capturing this essence of competition, Exgress not only promote people to increase their daily amount of exercises, but also feel accomplished with the community while doing so. The app will drive competition and in turn drive people to reach their fitness goals! </p>\n<h2>What Exgress does</h2>\n<p>Although Exgress took its roots from the game Ingress, it is first and foremost a fitness app. The application requires the data from a Microsoft Fitness Band. The high-level overview of the application is that upon signing up for Exgress, a user will choose one of two teams. The objective of each team is to capture as many real-life landmarks as they can, while defending the already captured from the other team. All the stats within the Exgress will be derived from the data taken from the Microsoft Fitness Band. We use band stats such as heart rate sensor and the calories counter to formulate how strong a team is at a given time. With these stats, the users can proceed around their neighborhoods and capture the beacons. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built this application on the Android Platform. Throughout the project, we utilized Android Studio, Microsoft Azure as the back-end, Microsoft Fitness Band API, and the Google Maps API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>As none of us are familiar with Android in depth (half of us were actually Android beginners), the initial climb to set-up the project was a lot more difficult then we expected. However, after 36 hours of stackoverflowing, we are really proud of our prototype of Exgress. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>EXGRESS YEEEAAHH</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-band\">microsoft-band</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ronakp/Exgress\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ronakp/Exgress\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Food4Mood", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Food4Mood \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/365/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Food4Mood \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/366/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>This app helps you decide what you want based off the way you're feeling that day.

A friendly internet fosters good health to everyone that uses it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Heartfelt is a chrome extension that allows the user to highlight text and determine the positivity and friendliness of that text through sentiment analysis. This can help people reconsider what they type before sending it, so they get the best responses from others.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using chrome extension and a hefty amount of javascript, css3, and HTML5. When the chrome extension is clicked, we made an API call to the HP sentiment analysis api which gave a value from -1 to 1 back to the chrome extension html page. We normalized the value from 0 to 1, by adding the result of the response with 1 and dividing it by two. After that, we used some nice css3 animations to create a bar to rank the friendliness of the text that was analyzed. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Asynchronous calls threw us off a bit!\nA big challenge was figuring out how to work with chrome extensions. It was quite difficult to figure out how to connect the current tab to the extension page, but we figured it out. Ajax was a little difficult to work with because we were using it to send and get requests from the API server which took a little while to figure out.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The UI is beautiful, and we think it works perfectly.\nIt's a tool we'll use ourself because it's quick and easy to use.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use the HP sentiment analysis api which is useful for future projects. We also learned to work with larger chrome extensions and understand asynchronous calls better.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Heartfelt</h2>\n<p>A much more trained sentiment analyzer which uses machine learning to incorporate a much larger variety of sentiment classification. We want to also integrate it into the social setting by implementing it in chats so we can analyze declines and uprisings in friendships.

It shows culturally significant places near you (&lt;2km radius) as a series of tiles which you can scroll through. If you click on a tile, it opens up a website on the phone with information about the place. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Microsoft Band is connected with an android app on your phone. The app is non-intrusive, runs in the background and will not disturb you. The app automatically gets information of culturally significant places near you from Google using the Places API. It sends a list of place names to the band. When you click on a tile in the band, a web event is triggered on your phone which opens up a website with a URL attached to the particular place. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting culturally significant places on the app using the Google Places API was a challenge. We had to find our current location, get a list of places and filter them by types (museums, art galleries, temples, mosques, churches, synagogues, cemeteries, universities and libraries). We spent a lot of time resolving errors. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our team synergy towards a common goal and creating an app which would help people learn more about local culture</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We pretty much had to learn everything.

When we found out the specific hack that we were being asked to implement, we realized that it would be an excellent opportunity to create a web application that serves as both a simple interface for consumers and an effective sales technique to fill distressed packages.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Dibs</strong> displays a neatly-organized grid of potential destinations for the wanderlust traveler. Beautiful photographs taken from relevant Instagram posts that illustrate the scenery of the destination in question are overlaid with the name of the location. If the consumer is interested, they click and are provided with the bare minimum information: the ground covered by their flight, a photograph of the resort they will be staying at, and a stream of photos that display the activities that take place at this location. If they decide that the time and trip are right, they click \"Book Now\", which takes them to JetBlue's website to book their getaway.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Since this is a mockup, we carefully selected the most appealing images we could find to serve as front-page eye-catchers. These components are generated by <strong>react.js</strong>. The followup page uses <strong>Google Maps</strong>' API to illustrate the flight path on a map, while the streaming images are animated by <strong>react.js</strong> (these images are also curated; more on that in the next section). <strong>Flask</strong> was used as a web framework and <strong>Heroku</strong> was used to host the application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The most significant challenges we had to deal with were API issues. For instance, Instagram's API is neither thorough nor reliable: posts older than 7 days cannot be fetched, and direct media retrieval is only possible through a pipeline of API calls. As a result, we were only able to retrieve posts that were only geographically relevant: content was random and often inappropriate. After recognizing these issues, we attempted to move forward and use Twitter's API to retrieve the same information in analogous ways. This proved to be challenging by virtue of Twitter's strict limitations of use: we were unable to retrieve the information required before getting locked out.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The design is sleek, simple, and arguably quite effective. If marketed towards those who tend to take vacations on a whim, they are provided with only as much as they need to make their decision: pictures, encouragement, and scope of travel. Individuals who are likely to impulsively travel are not interested in the particulars, such as (but not limited to) price, specific activities/itinerary, and departure time.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about cross-compatibility of API's and how things don't always work out as well as you'd like them to.  Less-experienced members of the team were provided an opportunity to learn about <strong>react.js</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Dibs</h2>\n<p><em>Dibs</em> boasts an incredibly simple interface that could be implemented in a very short amount of time. If refined and developed by means of substantial research, Dibs could plausibly reduce the loss incurred by JetBlue when getaway packages are left unclaimed.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jetblue-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://jetblue-dibs.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://jetblue-dibs.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>jetblue-dibs.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Jungle Scribe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jungle Scribe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/317/018/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>From tutoring in schools we noticed kids often don't know the proper way to write letters and as a result their work can be untidy, we wanted to make a tool that could help them improve while being more interesting than a school workbook</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Prompts kids to trace a capital letter and then calculates a percentage to represent how accurate the child was in tracing the letter.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Was coded in Python using the tkinter graphics package.

When we want to go on a getaway on spring break to Rocky Point or Miami, often times we're on a tight budget. Because it is so tough to find cheap, packaged bundles for travel deals, we decided to build a search engine based on our personal preferences that would find ourselves a destination that suits our needs. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Destinator is a basica webapp that can be used on many platforms and browsers. To obtain potential dream destinations the user must answer 3 simple questions </p>\n<ol>\n<li> The Amount of People Traveling </li>\n<li> The Group's Total Budget </li>\n<li> The Duration of the Trip </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Once that is all completed, the Priceline API will search through their database and we will be able to display the user the destinations that fall underneath their preferences.\n<br/> \nUsers will be shown their destination(hotel), hotel rating, price, and dates. The information given will be displayed on cards that the users can select if they like or dislike (tinder-style). If the users swipes left, the user will be shown another destination. If the user swipes right, they will be matched with the destination and be sent to a page where they can pay for their entire trip. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>At first we attempted to create a mobile application. We looked into utilizing swift to create an iOS app, however after much contemplation we believed that the best way to utilize this service would be through a web browser. We believed this to be optimal because, then anyone from anywhere can access the simple link and be able to find their dream destination. </p>\n<p>The process was a relatively fun, but challenging task. We had to interpret Priceline's API and figure out how we would be able to obtain all the given data and display it to our users. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Challenges that we ran into was developing the iOS app. At first we put a few hours into figuring out how to make a similar tinder clone, but with options for personal preferences. After much consideration we switched to a webapp instead -- to make it easier for both the user and us (the developers). A lot of the other small challenges were simple bugs that we would encounter and fix along the way. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>With two of our members being first time hackers and two of the other as veteran hackers, it was a great experience for everyone. We would work together to find our strengths and weaknesses and cooperate in order to produce the final product. </p>\n<h2>What's next for The Destinator</h2>\n<p>We want to implement more APIs or a system to split payments. We believe that it would amazing if we could send a link (similar to let's say kickstarter) and see the progress as to how far everyone is in the group towards funding their getaways. We also believe that we should be able to develop mobile apps in the future to those that would prefer an app of their phones for notifications on hot deals. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jalvarado91/destinator\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jalvarado91/destinator\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on backend, priceline API integration and software SPA foundation.", "", "", ""]], ["MealShare", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MealShare \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/912/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MealShare \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/913/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MealShare \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/942/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Meal share connects food hosts with guests</p>\n<p>Feel like cooking tonight?

We also wanted this to be a very casual activity and emphasized the collaboration aspect on sharing through Facebook. Since Facebook doesn't have much of a presence in the world of music (like Spotify and SoundCloud), we thought it would be an interesting idea to promote Facebook's API through this hack.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Record your singing and/or music and share it for others to work on top of. Share it to Facebook for the world to see!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Facebook's Parse (as well as their sharing/login API), Microsoft's Azure hosting, Swift 2.0, and Node.js. iOS users can upload their recordings to Parse, contributing to a mobile newsfeed, and allowing web users to collaborate with them (and vice versa).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Parsing .m4a files into mp3 files was a seriously painful and lonely journey (Apple prefers .m4a while the rest of the world likes .mp3). Connecting the backend of both our web and mobile apps was also challenging as we had to configure our Parse classes to be ambiguous enough to host users on both an iOS device and a computer. Also, it was difficult to learn Apple's AVFoundation framework to configure and maintain audio files.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our application works on both web and mobile. It was a miracle. We found really good social applications for our app and had an amazing time making it.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned further intricacies of iOS development and Javascript, the pains of trying to maintain a simple UI/UX, and how to use Parse as both a web and mobile backend.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Byte</h2>\n<p>We plan to update the app to provide cool audio effects and further layering tricks in the form of studio editing in the next release! We'll also try to provide further compatibility for files outside of just m4a and mp3.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mean\">mean</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sungjp/beathub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sungjp/beathub\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://yhackbyte.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://yhackbyte.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>yhackbyte.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the iOS app in its entirety as well as the front-end of the web app. I used Parse and Facebook's sharing APIs along with Apple's AVFoundation framework to configure and parse audio files for universal access.", "I built the backend server which handled requests on the web frontend, developed the audio layering and integrated with Parse and Facebook for sharing and manipulating files.", "Designed the product and integrated it into our iOS App and Web App. Used HTML5's Audio API to make Byte come to life."]], ["FiscalNote Reader ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FiscalNote Reader  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/887/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FiscalNote Reader  \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/888/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"FiscalNote Reader  \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/889/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I thought that the FiscalNote data/API seemed interesting to work with, </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The two project files are getcode2.html and codespec.html. getcode2 links to codespec.</p>\n<p>You type in a first, or last name, but not both, of a legislator.

We decided to focus on data-driven diagnosis, and that's how this project came into being.</p>\n<h2>What it does?</h2>\n<p>Before we discuss how our system facilitates diagnosis, let us talk about the challenges faced by traditional medicine in diagnosing osteoporosis and related bone disorders:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There's no way for human eyes to sense these disorders beforehand \u2013\u00a0until a fracture gets developed.<br/></li>\n<li>Once a fracture develops, the probability of complexity in the future increases substantially.</li>\n<li>Research suggests that after reaching the age of fifty, 1 in 2 women will have a future fracture related to osteoporosis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Why Kinect?</strong></p>\n<p>Kinect allows us to rapidly develop and deploy a working prototype that can process massive amount of data to give real-time diagnosis. We ourselves wouldn't recommend using this project in its current form for medical practice as a lot of things can be improved.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this demo is to attract attention towards increasing importance of computing in medicine and introduce a novel way how computing can aid medical professionals reach better conclusions. </p>\n<p>Medical professionals cannot be <strong>replaced</strong> by computers \u2013\u00a0but data-driven tools like these would certainly <strong>help</strong> caregivers develop insights that substantially improve the quality of care they provide, thereby helping ensure that lives are not affected by preventable diseases such as osteoporosis. </p>\n<p>Perhaps given the right resources, we can evolve this into a market ready solution for out-of-the-box deployment.</p>\n<h2>How it works?</h2>\n<p>On its initial run, the application works in a \"learning mode\" that allows it to gather vast amount of data when the Kinect sensor is placed strategically. This data is then input into a Machine Learning library that churns out certain parameters which define the normal posture and skeletal configuration of a human being. </p>\n<p>On subsequent runs, any obtained data is compared with the initially obtained model in real-time. Cases that vary widely or that can be matched with known parameters of a positive subject are tagged by a large red blip hovering on the area that is statistically anticipated to be affected. Though this leaves a gap to develop false positives, it makes the possibility of a false negative extremely low,\u00a0which is far better than having no early warnings at all.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The most difficult challenge we faced throughout the journey of developing our project was that none of us were well-versed with Machine Learning and Neural Networks, which we were able to overcome by the use of a machine learning library.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We feel some sense of pride that our work was able to enhance the accuracy of Kinect's skeletal model generation by using its depth sensing capabilities. We also feel happy that we have built something that has the potential to improve lives.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Hack</li>\n<li>Prototype</li>\n<li>????</li>\n<li>Revolutionize Medicine.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While it would be too naive to expect that our demo would revolutionise medicine overnight, we see this as a significant starting point in improving the field of medicine.

With this, the program uses a database of past taxi cab rides to give a time estimate, fare estimate, and maps the route on Google Maps.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>On the back-end, we imported the taxi cab data into a database and then wrote a mySQL query that, given a start point, end point, and departure time, returns average fare and average trip time of past similar trips found in the data.\nOn the front-end side, we used Google Maps APIs in JavaScript to display the map, plot markers at the points, and map the route. We used HTML5 and CSS to format the page, and used PHP to receive the input from the user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had challenges in retrieving GPS coordinate values from the marker location. Another major challenge is the size of the data -- because there is so much data, it takes a long time to search the database and return fare and time values. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of our front-end UI and of working through problems.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned Google Maps API and developed in some languages unfamiliar to some of us. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Taxi Calculator</h2>\n<p>Finishing the project and getting it to work through the last bug of returning null values for fare. Getting it to work through the data faster. Making fare and distance calculated from the data more accurate. Linking to functional taxi calls.

Whenever I'm in sync with the tempo at a given stroke rating, my erg scores are fantastic; out of sync, not so much. Striving to consistently perform my best during erg practices, I figured that developing a program that plays stroke-rate specific music would not only enable me to score better, but make workouts more fun. We built ergDJ to do this; based on the specific stroke rating for a workout, the athlete is able to play specially formulated playlists with songs at a tempo to match the pace of their workout. </p>\n<p>Winter training is often a psychologically challenging time; we're operating much more on an individual-basis, we're not able to get out on the water, and it's us vs. the erg. We often dread practices; having music as a tool to face this often-perceived challenge is critical to not only get faster and stronger in the winter, but better ourselves as rowers. </p>\n<p>Our hope is that ergDJ not acts as a training tool, but helps make the time spent on the erg more bearable.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used CSS and HTML to build the front end of this webapp with some help from bootstrap.

</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, we feel down. Whether it's bad weather, bad people, or simply a bad day, there are only a couple things in life that can be guaranteed to lift moods. Chocolate can't be summoned immediately via laptops, airplane tickets to Disneyland are expensive, and we couldn't figure out a program in under 4 KB to boost our GPAs. So we came up with CatCaller, a simple, instant,and convenient mood booster. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Instead of sliding down the dangerously slippery slope that is Google Images \"cats\", just click the cat on your toolbar. Take a moment to relax and laugh at the guaranteed hilarious cat gif, and continue on your tasks without losing momentum. Need a bit more cat in your life? Click for more! When you're satiated, simply click out of the popup. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We knew we couldn't be the only ones out there obsessed with cats, so looked for an API that would get the cat images for us. Thanks to <a href=\"http://thecatapi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thecatapi.com/</a>, we were able to retrieve random cat GIFs at the click of our button. The Chrome extension requires a manifesto.json, an html file that displays the GIFs and button, and Javascript code to implement the button.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We got the program to work in a browser relatively early on, but the real struggle was getting to work on in a chrome extension. Debugging was extraordinarily painful (Huge shoutout to the wonderful engineers at Datto who spent literally hours refreshing cat GIFs as they tried to help us making a working button), but eventually, we got working code. We're still not sure exactly what we were doing wrong, but we know what the right thing is!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This is our first hackathon, and first experience with programming that doesn't involve a homework assignment or Khan Academy's programming environment. To be honest, we're pretty overjoyed that we managed to create something we could submit. We're especially proud that we stuck through learning the very basics (so much StackOverflow!). Everyone always talks about how the learning curve is steep but worth it, so we're glad we finally sat down and started trying to make our project. We know it was small (literally 3KB), but now that we've had a taste, we feel more prepared to tackle something bigger.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Picking up a programming language is <em>really</em> hard. We definitely overwhelmed ourselves in the beginning, switching between about 3 languages, 4 ideas, and 25 tabs. We learned to be patient with each other and our code, as both of us were novices. We learned to ask for help from the internet and people at YHack. Most importantly, we learned that Chrome extensions do not support in-line JS.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CatCaller</h2>\n<p>CatCaller started out as a joke, but we actually think that with a bit more work, the concept could be turned into a real mood-booster. We're thinking of an extension that lets you upload an album of pictures that make you happy. Clicking an icon on your toolbar would bring up a random picture from that album in a popup window, thus providing a small pick-me-up without interfering with productivity.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_sRt5c3WoLKZ3NCaVFwZnBoY0E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B_sRt5c3WoLKZ3NCaVFwZnBoY0E\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>drive.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/catcaller/mjdbgfhhlflopfgkcgnggibocfljgega/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/catcaller/mjdbgfhhlflopfgkcgnggibocfljgega/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>chrome.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Sudoku Solver", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sudoku Solver \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/615/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Sudoku Solver \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/617/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This is our first hackathon, so we wanted to create a simpler project that would allow us to explore a new algorithm (backtracking).</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This project uses a combination of a logical approach and backtracking to efficiently and recursively solve any Sudoku puzzle with at least 17 initial clues.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The project is split into two modules, board.py and solver.py.

Individuals with Tourettes is an inherited neuropsychiatric disorder with onset in childhood, characterized by multiple physical (motor) tics and at least one vocal (phonic) tic. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed temporarily, and are preceded by a premonitory urge. And there are certain environmental conditions that can cause these tics to occur even more frequently. PTSD is another disease we wanted to focus on as well. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a very serious condition caused by stressful reoccuring events that may reappear at any time with certain environmental factors that may take place. Finding these kind of external stimuli may be difficult, which is why TriggerTracker is here to help.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>## What it does</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>TriggerTracker is the only chronic illness tracker that helps control, treat and prevent chronic illnesses that people may have. We are currently hard-coded into Tourettes, but this can easily be modified to suit the conditions of various chronic disorders such as PTSD, Crohn's Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, etc.<br/></li>\n<li>The Pebble app creates a menu of potential \"triggers\" of the illness.  When one is selected, the user is brought to a second menu page where they determine if the trigger elicited an effect.  Depending on the response, an ajax request is made to a google-script that logs a timestamp, the type of trigger, and whether a response occurred into a google spreadsheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>## How I built it</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We used Pebble.js on CloudPebble.net to create a Pebble app that allowed users to record potential causes and analyze the data. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>## Challenges I ran into</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We ran into many challenges; coming into this project, we had no experience with Pebble development and no knowledge of the JavaScript programming language.</li>\n<li>By far the biggest challenge was to make the Pebble watch properly output to a Google spreadsheet.  While all versions use a call to the Pebble.js object, not all attempts were successful.  Our initial approach attempted to use a google form's post method; however, this resulted in only a timestamp being saved.  Upon finding a google-script written by Martin Hawksey, it became clearer how to accomplish this.  Using the script straightaway was unsuccessful as it was difficult to determine the necessary format for the Pebble's ajax data.  Despite this, with a few console.log() statements, we were able to determine the necessary data formatting and establish proper emission to the Google spreadsheet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>## Accomplishments that I'm proud of</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We can now collect real, meaningful data about our chronic conditions in a form that we can easily analyze to determine how to better manage our conditions by avoiding their potential triggers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>## What I learned</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We learned how to use Pebble.js.</li>\n<li>Learned about various diseases like PTSD and what conditions might occur.</li>\n<li>JavaScript</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>## What's next for TriggerTracker</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make Pebble app configurable, allowing users to set spreadsheet output URL and list of triggers</li>\n<li>We will be developing an iOS and Android mobile application for this to analyze data generated by TriggerTracker automatically.

It's a very basic game, but it runs, though the only problem is that it won't run more than once (game is not able to be played multiple times in one run.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bluej</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["N", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>made extension that turns instances of our friend's name to his nickname.

We were inspired by the desire to create a gaming environment in everyday settings such as one's house. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Kit Katapult is a game bot in which the user can control and see through the vision of his robot using an Oculus Rift. The user may also control the robot's motion and the loading/shooting of Kit Kats (or other friendly trajectories) through an XBox controller. Post pictures of \"victims\" to Kit Katapult's facebook page.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The robot itself is constructed with Vex Robotics parts. Its main components are the base (motion), the shooting mechanism, the magazine/cartridge contraption, and the mounted vision system.</p>\n<p>The Kit Katapult has a unique range of motion such that it can strafe in any direction due to its omni wheels placed at 45 degree angles. There are four motors controlling movement, six motors controlling loading/shooting of trajectories, and two motors controlling visual scope. Each motor is controlled by one of the three Arduino/Adafruit MotorShields and powered by one of the three batteries.</p>\n<p>The shooting mechanism utilizes nautilus gears and elastic bands. The unique, increasing-radius shape of the gears creates tension in the bands that will release the Kit Kats.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Alt text\" data-canonical-url=\"https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/78408060164b49936b40e070a0f316b7/original.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--_PUSXZWt--/https://d2t1xqejof9utc.cloudfront.net/screenshots/pics/78408060164b49936b40e070a0f316b7/original.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>There are two cameras mounted atop the Kit Katapult on two axes of rotation to allow for both horizontal and vertical movement.</p>\n<h2>Software</h2>\n<p>The Kit Katapult has three main components. The lowest level in terms of software abstraction, is that of a cpp program that governs movement of the motors. On top of that is a perception module, also in cpp, which interacts with a server on azure. The azure-flask server is the keystone in this arc de triumph because it relays the positional tracking information from the oculus rift to the robot's onboard computer via the aforementioned perception module. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vex-robotics</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tk1</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adafruit\">adafruit</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xbox\">xbox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gstreamer</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kit-kat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Gas Cost Estimator", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gas Cost Estimator \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/515/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gas Cost Estimator \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/316/516/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It's always a guessing game to figure out how much a friend owes you for driving them around. That, plus out of curiosity it'd be nice to estimate how much every trip costs in gas!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Automatically calculates the amount of money spent on gas during a trip. Gets the average gas price in the area, gets data from the user's phone for how many miles traveled, time elapsed, and average MPH. The user inputs their average MPG, and the app automatically calculates the price of the trip.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Downloaded Android Studio and its SDK's to learn how to use it. Created a \"Hello World\" application, then turned it into this app.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Downloading Android Studio... Also downloading required drivers for my phone to be able to run projects on it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Gas Cost Estimator</h2>\n<p>Hopefully publishing it on the app store one day! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
