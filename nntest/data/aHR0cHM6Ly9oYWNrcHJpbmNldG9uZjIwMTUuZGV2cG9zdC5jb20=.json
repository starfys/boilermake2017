The interface for instructions features an array of timers, progress of action items (e.g. chopping mushrooms), upcoming tasks, and progress of background tasks (e.g. boiling water).</p>\n<p>Lazy Chef features a robust recipe import system, that takes a simple, human readable file and adds it to a library of recipes. The library can generate a set of instructions for any set of recipes in the library whose prerequisite ingredients are listed. </p>\n<p>Lazy Chef was implemented in Python and Javascript. Thorough documentation for the Python backend is provided via docstring.</p>\n<h2>More Screenshots</h2>\n<h3>Recipe Selection</h3>\n<p><img alt=\"Selection\"

We were particularly inspired by the idea of helping victims of domestic abuse -- in many cases, it is difficult for them to get help before and during an attack, and we thought of WatchOut as a way to help these people get the help they deserve. What's more, we were also inspired by how WatchOut could be used to make people feel more safe in general. As four women, we have all had uncomfortable experiences when having a wearable tech system, quite literally watching out for us and contacting appropriate people should there be an emergency, would have been so, so welcome. Introducing WatchOut!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WatchOut is a safety system with a Pebble smartwatch watchapp, iPhone app, external sensor (microphone)/circuitry, Firebase database. Since smartwatches come with accelerometers, we tapped into that data to code an app that can sense when an arm (that the watch is on) moves upward into a defensive position. In addition, we have a microphone that can sense when a loud distress noise is made. Together, these two data points in the app will be able to send a distress signal through the app and connect to third-party apps to send emergency messages to emergency contacts. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it by integrating the different components together through connecting the PebbleWatch to the companion app on the phone using Objective-C on XCode to program the app and C to program the watchapp. Furthermore, we designed a microphone circuitry that connected to the online database Firebase as well as the companion iOS app developed. Finally, we developed a button that could connect to a third-party to send emergency messages automatically when triggered by motion and microphone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into problems with the limited capabilities of PebbleWatch firmware, especially since firmware 1.0 does not contain real-time bidirectional communication capabilities, which would have been helpful for sending accelerometer data from the watch to the companion app on the phone. Furthermore, we ran into problems with the limited possibilities within iOS software development, specifically because Apple does not allow you to send automated messages using iMessage, meaning we would have had to use another application and performed authentication (which would have stretched much beyond our timeline). On the hardware side, the microphone sensor's voltage range did not match that of the Electric Imp. Also, dealing with the frequency of the audio signals and connecting the Elctric Imp to a Cloud database proved to be difficult. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the social reach of our app - with some fine-tuning, it may prove to serve incredibly beneficial for the safety of people in dangerous situations, particularly with respect to young girls and women facing threats of sexual assault and domestic violence. This was also our first hackathon and we were proud, as an all-girl team, to focus our efforts on expanding the rights and protection of women, especially in light of rampant university sexual assault cases and worldwide gender discrimination. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Much of what we implemented was new to us -- as a team, we learned to design an iOS app, interact with Pebble smartwatch, use electric imp to collect data from a microphone, send to a Firebase database, and collaborate together as a team while dividing tasks to make deadlines.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WatchOut</h2>\n<p>Future steps for WatchOut revolve around increasing the sophistication of the integration. This includes moving it to a newer version of the firmware that would allow for easier data transfer from the smartwatch to the iOS app (and would specifically allow for the use of AppMessage that would facilitate bidirectional communication), using more information from the database, using the SOS button to text emergency contacts, expanding the software to other platforms (including the Android, which might prove friendlier to our project), transmitting GPS coordinates for the purpose of distribution to emergency contacts, and establishing a connection to Nest through which we would place markers in the footage if GPS coordinates showed the potential victim to be at home. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/electric-imp\">electric-imp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sensors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">circuit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">squirrel</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["PowerGrab", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PowerGrab \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/507/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PowerGrab \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/509/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PowerGrab \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/510/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PowerGrab \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/512/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PowerGrab \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/513/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to find some way, some how to reverse wireless charging. There are energy waves surrounding us at all times, so how cool would it be to leverage that!? PowerGrab uses one form of energy available - vibrations - and converts it in to a DC power supply. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A piezoelectric transducer captures the vibrational energy from a Pebble watch. The Pebble and transducer are tuned so that their natural frequencies are as close as possible and a rectification circuit converts the output of the transducer in to usable DC power.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We spent many careful hours characterizing the piezo and finding its natural frequency, and then doing the same for the Pebble. Next we attached the piezo to the Pebble and began tuning the Pebble's frequency to achieve resonance (a very tricky process). As we approached resonance, the piezo's output voltage increased, so we continued until we got to a usable amount of voltage output with the Pebble vibrating. Next up was the rectification circuit. We needed to convert the AC signal to a DC supply so we implemented a wheatstone bridge with four diodes for full-wave rectification. Next, we tested varying smoothing capacitor values and picked the best of what we had. Finally, we were able to power an LED! \n(We would have loved to boost our DC voltage up to 4 V and feed it back in to the Pebble, but alas, we were missing a few critical hardware components for that.)</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Frequency tuning is a difficult process with the right equipment and piezo's do not give out too much voltage without resonance. Therefore, we had to spend hours upon hours trying to bring down the frequency of the Pebble to get closer to the natural frequency of the piezo. </p>\n<p>When we finally got that working, the struggle continued in to the rectification circuit: we lost any voltage that we thought we had (we were getting less than 0.2 VDC, yikes). We had to take a step back and debug the circuit step by step, try out different hardware components, re-tune the frequency, change components, re-tune, and on and on. \nWe weren't able to get the measly 0.2 V up to a usable 1.85 V until late in to the night. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>WE POWERED AN LED WITH A PIEZO! (and we're excited about it =) ) This project idea was ... a stretch, to say the least. We couldn't find any examples of this being done online and thought we might be crazy to be embarking on a project that might be truly impossible scientifically. BUT, we saw a small opportunity for crazy cool power harvesting and the math said it was <em>possible</em> (though highly implausible), so we dove in. It took days of frustration and seemingly thankless hardware tuning, but in the final hour... WE POWERED AN LED WITH A PIEZO!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Tuning natural frequencies is quite challenging and piezos are incredibly sensitive.

Using the web interface, you can tell PANDA when to remind you. PANDA can take either a list of times or set period between reminders.</p>\n<p>Once it is time to take your medication, PANDA will start beeping and light up the indicator next to the medicine you need to take. The only way to quiet PANDA is to open the box, so there is no chance you will forget to take your medicine. Also, PANDA remembers if you took your medicine already. If the light is red, you know you don't need to take the pill again.</p>\n<h1>Motivation</h1>\n<p>Regardless of how careful doctors and pharmacists are at prescribing medicine, the responsibility of actually taking the correct medication at the right times still falls on the patient. Despite how important it is to take the right medication at the right time, pharmacists still have to give instructions verbally to patients and these instructions grow increasingly complex as the number of prescriptions increase. Using PANDA, patients can bring a pharmacist home with them. Pharmacists are able to fill out an online with drug administration instructions and that information is then transmitted via Wi-Fi using Electric Imp to PANDA, which is fitted with two LEDs per prescription. One that lights up green which means take and one that lights up red that means do not take. The PANDA beeps when it\u2019s time to take medicine and the beeping only stops when a light sensor detects that PANDA has been opened and thus medication has been taken. Because the PANDA is battery-operated, it can be put in the most convenient location. PANDA is great for patients who have to take medicine daily, from those taking Lipitor after a heart attack, to women on birth control.</p>\n<h1>Hardware</h1>\n<p><img alt=\"Schematic\" data-canonical-url=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AG6GR/PANDA/gh-pages/doc/Schematic.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--ddmNXc1f--/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AG6GR/PANDA/gh-pages/doc/Schematic.png\"/></p>\n<p>PANDA is built around the Electric Imp platform. PANDA uses a CdS photocell to detect if the lid is open or not based on the brightness change. This photocell is read using an analog input on the Electric Imp using a 1k\u03a9 resistor on the high side in a voltage divider configuration. There are two red/green LED's (Newark 20K5342) indicating which medicine to take. These LED's are bidirectional, so they emit green light when biased in one direction and red light when biased in the other. The LED's are controlled using two pairs of digital output pins. The final pin is used to drive the piezo speaker (Sparkfun COM-07950) using a fixed frequency PWM signal. PANDA is powered by a 4xAA battery holder hooked into the battery input (P+/-) pads on the Electric Imp.</p>\n<h1>Software</h1>\n<p>PANDA can be configured using a <a href=\"https://ag6gr.github.io/PANDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">web interface</a>, created using Bootstrap and Javascript. The web interface communicates with the Electric Imp servers using standard http requests. Timekeeping and alert triggering are managed by polling loops in the server side of the Electric Imp. The device is notified of alerts using the standard message passing functionality built into the Electric Imp platform.

Most ordinary internet users, while they may not be aware of network security problems, are not protected against unknown users connecting to their internet. This is both a security and a privacy concern for internet users. Our inspiration for this project was originally to help people protect against potential robberies by detecting bluetooth or wireless connection signals from the would-be robbers' phones. However, after starting the project and considering different ideas, the team switched to a device that would help network security. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our WiFi/Bluetooth honeypot is a Raspberry Pi (RasPi) that passively detects unknown devices within a well-defined area. The user can register known devices that to ignore while focusing on the unknown devices. Once the RasPi detects a MAC address of an unknown device within the radius trying to connect to its sandboxed wireless access point, Home Honeypot will send a push notification to the user's phone. The user registers the known devices using a locally hosted website on the RasPi, so the device is very easy to set up. The RasPi simply has to be connected to a router using ethernet and it will immediately start to detect devices around it.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Raspberry Pi (RasPi) to set up the honeypot that detects MAC address of devices in a given area. The RasPi has both a Bluetooth and WiFi adapter connected to it, so it detects both signals. The known devices can be inputted into Home Honeypot using a locally hosted website containing a form which stores data as a JSON file containing known users of the network. The website is hosted using a Python server running locally on the Pi and is not visible from either the unsecured network or the internet. All data is also stored locally, reducing the attack surface for attackers, as there's no central service to be hacked. The MAC addresses of the devices around the RasPi are then compared the to the MAC addresses of the known users. If there are any unknown devices connected to or near the network, the RasPi will send out a push notification using the Pushbullet API for Android and the unknown users are shown the user on the website.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One major challenge that the team faced was finding hardware that would fulfill the needs of the project. The initial bluetooth and the wifi adapters did not provide enough configurability. A great deal of time was spent trying to solve this problem using the initial adapters, but eventually the team decided to go out and purchase better hardware. Another problem that the team faced was thinking of a practical idea for the hackathon. The team wanted to spend the time at the hackathon creating a project that would be pragmatic and useful for the world, but also feasible to make in the 36 hours of the event.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to sniff for valid MAC addresses and parsing through them was a big accomplish for the team. Additionally, most of the team had not worked on a hardware hack before, so setting up the correct kernel modules for the RasPi and getting the adaptors working were accomplishments for the entire team. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cgi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zdavidli/HomeHoneypot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zdavidli/HomeHoneypot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on designing the website that would let the user configure their settings.

Briefly, we store real time heartbeats per minute and skin temperature to an online DB and compute averages for them every single login           attempt, if the very last readings show something above or lower than average plus threshold then the user is logged in to a honeypot instead of real system (Anomaly detection), to protect the system from gun point logins, disgruntled employees who usually become nervous when doing internal attacks,resulting in detectable spikes, or even hacking attempts, as different people have different averages and metabolic rates. However, if this was just a false positive, maybe the user was just running to work, the user could whisper a passphrase to the system in the first 90 seconds he/she was logged to the honeypot, to get access to the real system and log this event for review by admin. On            the other hand, upon testing we found that as we compute the average real time if the user was running then his averages should slightly be changed for the last few hours and training mode would be activated on the band using calories burned and running motion which in this case will result in a successful login to the real system directly, omitting the false positive detection. System will not process the login attempt if the band isn\u2019t in 10 feet range or if it is not worn, making brute force attempts harder. This is just 3rd factor  authentication that for best results should be used with a strong password and a verification code sent to the user\u2019s cell phone when the correct credentials are submitted. This solution costs the same as an average access key but it is unlikely that someone would lose his Band compared to a  smart access card or key, and even if that happened the connected device would notify you, moreover it promotes a healthy life style for employees making them feel better.

However, n-body simulations are very resource intensive and require a lot of processing power to compute and render.</p>\n<p>At HackPrinceton, we hacked up two algorithms for running n-body simulations, the Barnes-Hut algorithm and the naive algorithm.  We started from scratch and used C/C++ and Cairo for rendering.  We used OpenMP for parallelism.</p>\n<p>To deploy our software, we used Linode, running our simulations and rendering across a couple of beefy 20-core, 96 GB nodes.  We deployed two simulations, one of a 10,000 body system and another of a 100,000 body system.  This took overnight, so the total cost of deploying these models stayed within the handy $50 Linode voucher.</p>\n<p>The impact of deploying our simulation in the cloud was significant.  Each timestep of the 10,000 body system took approximately 23 seconds to perform on a mid-2012 MacBook Pro, but only 0.7 seconds to perform when deployed on Linode.  This helped keep the time of the simulation down so we could get some sleep Saturday night.</p>\n<p>Check out video from our <a href=\"https://youtu.be/hjXAvrzLMoI\" rel=\"nofollow\">10,000</a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DZ_JGjbk1Bk\" rel=\"nofollow\">100,000</a> particle simulations.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">openmp</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BenBrock/nbods\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BenBrock/nbods\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Implemented the Barnes-Hut algorithm.

Our goal was to give people access to #realtime buzz on topics they care about. We were inspired by how social media is driven by trending news and the possibility for an optimized search engine that recommends articles based on trends. Regular search engines only give information with a direct link to the input - we focused on connecting people to peripheral, yet equally important topics.</p>\n<p>The Twitter REST API is used to gather tweets associated with a user's hashtag of preference. We then aggregate all the other hashtags used in these tweets and present a visualization of these hashtags based on their frequency (and therefore relevance). The user can then click on the visual to search Twitter for the different phrases, thus finding relevant, trending news. They are exposed to information they care about, but might not know about.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of accomplishing this project within the given time frame, especially considering this was our first hackathon. We learned a lot about web development, data visualization and leveraging APIs. Our next goal is to expand #realtime to synthesize data from multiple social media sources. Eventually, it will be one of the most comprehensive and diverse places to explore trends and topics you care about.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">twit</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mihikakapoor/search-visualization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mihikakapoor/search-visualization\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["CommPound", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This app was inspired by the tragedy of the commons.
