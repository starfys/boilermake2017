The games we can use the gun with also include any games of our own design that follow the same structure as these classic games.\nWe used an Ardunio to connect an LED light sensor, a Bluetooth module, and a trigger to set up a gun. We used Java to develop our own version of Duck Hunt. We used Swift for the server side application.\nSome of the bigger challenges we found were the Bluetooth component was not cooperating for most of our time in the competition. Also the light sensor we developed was using an LED and the use of Mim's Effect which is very theoretical and limited.\nWe managed to build the guns wireless. Our light sensor worked and we managed to reverse its signal and read the light rather then emit it.\nWe learned a lot about the Mim's Effect and how it works. It is not an easy concept to grasp or implement, but we managed to make it work.\nFuture plans include adding additional players and stronger server side support.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nerf</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I proposed the idea for the project and studied the special LED properties that we used.

While taking a course in Education, I was given a list of grades and I was expected to calculate certain statistical values regarding those grades. It got me thinking that doing those calculations once wasn't such a big deal, but doing them regularly and with hundreds of grades was a hard job for teachers that could be simplified with a program. This is where the inspiration for creating Grade Stats came. The inspiration for Twitter Classrooms came from attending Twitter workshops. I learned they had a lot of useful tools to offer and I began to brainstorm ideas on how those tools could be applied to education.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Better Teaching has 2 tools: Grade Stats and Twitter Classroom. Grade Stats collects a list of grades and then calculates: the range, median, standard deviation, variance, and average. Twitter Classroom links Better Teaching with Twitter. Because a large amount of the population comunicate through Twitter (especially students), why can't teachers communicate with their students through this social network from a \"classroom\" account? Directly from Better Teaching, the teacher is able to update the students with HW assignments, upcoming tests, or any important event. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>First I divided the problem into different sections. I worked with Grade Stats, creating a separate algorithm for solving the different statistical values and then writing the code. Later I worked with Twitter Classroom. I worked with Java language and Android Studio. I also used Google and Youtube as resources.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>The most challenging part for me was creating Twitter Classroom. I had trouble installing the Twitter Fabric and at some point I altered my code in a way that I had to start from the beginning because it wouldn't run.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>I am very proud of myself because these 24 hours have been filled with completely new experiences for me. This was my first hackathon event. I decided to work alone because I wanted to challenge myself and see how much I could get done. This was also the first time I ever worked mobile development, Android Studio, Java and API's. I had a lot of fun and I met many nice people. I am definitely returning next year.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot of new things. I didn't know anything about mobile development but it was something I was very interested in. I learned about many tools that I will be definitely be working with in the future.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Better Teaching</h2>\n<p>Better Teaching is not done yet. I plan to include more tools that will help teachers. One I have in mind also involves Twitter. My goal is to link Better Teaching with Twitter DM where students can send there teachers pictures of specific doubts they have in a HW and the teacher will get a notification as soon he/she receives that image. By notifying the teacher immediately about any doubts, the teacher will be able to clear up that doubt fast and the student will be able to move on with the HW or lesson with that knowledge and not have any confusions that migh hurt him/her in lessons in the future. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["HashtagRunner", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Twitter's innovative technologies inspired us to learn and develop using their platform, as well as use this technology to try new ways of sharing trending topics on Twitter.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A 2D Side-Scroller where Larry the twitter bird has to avoid a randomly generated obstacle course to survive. These obstacles  are created from twitter's most popular hashtags at the moment the application is set to run. At the moment of losing due to a collision with one of the objects, the enemy hashtag that defeated the player is then shown to them through the players web browser.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Java library known as Slick2D in order to create the Side-Scroller. The Twitter REST API is used in order to find the most popular hashtags currently being used in various regions, which are then randomly generated as obstacles within the game. In order to implement the Twitter API in our Java code, we use the open source library known as Twitter4J to carry out the requests to the API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into issues with the hitboxes of our obstacles, as well managing the amount of times we generate requests to the API in order to avoid reaching our request limit at any moment.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to create the game with all of the core functionality desired, and have an innovative use of Twitter's technology both for entertainment and getting to know new topics being discussed on Twitter.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned not just about how to use the Twitter API, but also how to use and manage API's in general.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HashtagRunner</h2>\n<p>We hope to further develop HashtagRunner, possibly learning how to implement as web and moblie applications.

One of our team members had the idea of creating a web page/application capable of facilitating the difficult journey of finding who is selling a much needed course book for a class.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MercadoUPR is a webpage/application that allows all UPR students the opportunity to sell and buy college books online, without the hassle of having to look everywhere on flyers and bulletin boards, until getting lucky and finding the book you need, if you get lucky. Basically the app allows UPR students to post adds about the books they no longer need for college and want to sell and it also allows the students that want to buy books they need to look them up at a much faster paste and at a much more affordable price.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built MercadoUPR using CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript, along with applications like Appypie and Wampservers.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into multiple challenges, at first we wanted to use oracle mobile framework and Twitter's fabric API's to build a fully functional application. However we had compatibility problems and could not find a way to over come this problem due to unstable internet connection. Afterwards we also wanted to apply the \"ATH M\u00f3vil \" API as an option for our users to pay for their purchases, but we could not apply it due to time constraints.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of being able to overcome the problems we faced. Me and my team did our best and even do we were not able to finish the project exactly as we had planed, we are proud of the fact that we did not give up, worked well as a team and were able to overcome these obstacles.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about mobile app development, about many different API's and tools and most of all we learned about team work and compromise.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MercadoUPR</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wamp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/appy-pie\">appy-pie</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/emrivera/MercadoUPR.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/emrivera/MercadoUPR.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://snappy.appypie.com/html5/mercadoupr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://snappy.appypie.com/html5/mercadoupr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>snappy.appypie.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["HangBot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HangBot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/294/274/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>A multi-player we-based hangman game!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["jukebox", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Create a free virtual jukebox for the good comfort of the places' customers </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>creating python web socket that receives an string from Android app that select the song you want.
