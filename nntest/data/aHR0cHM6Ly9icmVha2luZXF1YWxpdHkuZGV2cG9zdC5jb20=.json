Healthcare workers and volunteers in these areas are often unable to efficiently diagnose the millions of people spread across rural towns and villages. We wanted to streamline the connection between the two parties to provide efficient, affordable, and accessible remote medical diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Diagnotes is an SMS-based application that allows patients to sign up with basic personal information, after which they can send any possible symptoms of diseases they may be affected by. An AI engine in the cloud parses the text data, runs a medical diagnosis, and notifies nearby healthcare workers and volunteers. The volunteers then remotely contact the patients with further instructions on how to proceed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We handled SMS receiving and responses using Twilio's API and a Node.js server deployed on Heroku. The actual medical diagnosis, based on the users' personal information and provided medical symptoms, is provided by Infermedica, the artificial intelligence medical diagnosis API. Every patients complete set of reported symptoms, history, and diagnoses is persisted on a MongoDB instance deployed at MLabs.<br/>\nVolunteers in the area are notified of pending diagnoses via an Android application, that uses intents to easily call patients and provide an up-to-date diagnosis.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>By far the largest challenge we ran into was creating a simple user experience for patients, since SMS does not provide the functionality of radio buttons or choices. Giving the listed symptoms a clean data structure, and allowing the patient to communicate their problems as freely as possible was particularly difficult.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Building a working, full-stack, end-to-end application before the deadline</li>\n<li>Cleanly parsing the user's symptoms and communicating with the Infermedica API</li>\n<li>Not falling asleep throughout the hackathon!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We learned how to deploy applications on Heroku</li>\n<li>We learned how to create a RESTful API using MongoDB and Node</li>\n<li>We became much more comfortable with new APIs such as Twilio, and much more confident with picking up new technologies </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for Diagnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Take full advantage of Infermedica's diagnostic tools to have SMS conversations with the user, collect more data, and produce more accurate diagnostics.</li>\n<li>Build a web app that collects low accuracy location data from the SMS, and visualize the symptoms reported by patients on a map</li>\n<li>Polish the UI for the Android app, and add features such as Push Notifications via Google Cloud Messaging</li>\n<li>Streamline the symptom matching and natural language processing on the backend for greater optimization</li>\n<li>Add additional language support such that Diagnotes actually becomes a practical solution for many countries around the world.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BreakInequality/Diagnotes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BreakInequality/Diagnotes\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BreakInequality/Diagnotes-Android\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BreakInequality/Diagnotes-Android\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I began by working on the backend, set up interactions with Twilio, deployed the Node.js application servers to Heroku, and set up the MongoDB clusters.

This app aims to make their lives a little easier by providing an all in one concept of smooth and paper free data collection and feeding it back to the patient in terms they can understand. Reminders, alerts, and other notifications to follow up after initial consultations are done by our phone and SMS service, thanks to Twilio's API.\nWe understand that not many women are keen to divulge private information about themselves, so we've used the concept of mapping a unique ID to every household, thus maintaining anonymity if needed.   </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>A lot of UX brainstorming, workshops, bugging sponsors and mentors for opinions and feedback regarding super vague idea, walking around the block, more brainstorming, kinda giving up, getting riled up on caffeine, and finally getting down to business with Android Studio, Firebase, and a bunch of other things we've never used before.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of our teammates had a sudden health issue and had to leave to a hospital. Also, this was our first time with the Twilio API and we ran into a few sync issues, which were resolved after a lot of digging into the docs. \nAnd finally, the name of the app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're a group of 5 strangers who're not so strange anymore. Despite being tired and stressed out, we had a lot of fun, that also ended up being other people's snap stories. Also, we think our app looks super cute.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We're living a privileged life compared to many people out there and there's so much we need to work on as a community together.\nGetting out of your comfort zone to explore new things can lead to interesting outcomes.\nPeople are nice.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HealthSimple</h2>\n<p>Mapping the unique ID to households in real time on Google Maps.\nSetting up a FAQ on internet.org so people can access basic emergency information for free.\nSetting up a virtual call centre system to connect patients to their closest health worker or centre.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a

Bangladesh has realized the need to invest in midwifery in order to drive down maternity and infant mortality rate. Organizations such as WHO and DFID are already implementing measures to increase the supply of midwives. However, we need to capitalize on providing an easy solution for Bengali women to connect with midwives. </p>\n<p>Midwives are important to increasing the chance of a successful pregnancy. Over 71% of women in Bangladesh give birth at home while only 36% have access to a midwife. Midwives can prevent fatalities when issues such as birth asphyxia (accountable for 50% of infant deaths in the neonatal period) and meningitis/sepsis (accountable for 48% infant deaths in the late neonatal period). It is calculated that in the 30 year career span of a midwife, they can save at least 36,178 lives, proving their worth to society.</p>\n<p>We came up with Dhatri, a simple SMS-based tool aimed to reduce the maternal and infant deaths that occur during and after pregnancy. Dhatri will educate women on what to expect when they're expecting, establish a relationship with the midwife and community, exemplifies an intuitive user experience for illiterate women, and is accessible to anyone regardless of whether they are registered. </p>\n<p>Dhatri features seamless registration, enabling our tool to be easy to use. We chose to use a simple speech-to-text converter so that women do not need to rely on text-heavy conversations. This allows for increased comprehension. Knowledge is accessible to anyone and any woman can receive answers to any concerns they may have during their pregnancy, such as, \"Is it okay if I'm bleeding?\" or \"Is it okay for me to have sex?\". Additionally, Dhatri's answers are provided without the need for a dedicated operator, increasing privacy related to the nature of the questions. Answers are provided in an audio format to address the literacy issue.</p>\n<p>Weekly reminders are personalized to the woman's progress in her pregnancy. Depending on how far along she is, nutrition information, symptoms, and warning signs are tailored to suit the expecting mother's needs. These weekly reminders are also sent in an audio format.</p>\n<p>One of the competitive advantages that Dhatri also has is improving the access to a midwife. Appointments are easily set up between the expecting mothers and midwives, increasing the accessibility of midwife services.</p>\n<p>Finally, the greatest result that we hope will arise from interacting with Dhatri is the formation of lasting and meaningful relationships. Midwives will support Bengali women and empower them with the knowledge, guidance, and support they need to have a successful pregnancy, resulting in drastically reducing the maternal and infant deaths that occur.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jrywn/Dhatri\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jrywn/Dhatri\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["SMS Mother", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SMS Mother \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/410/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SMS Mother \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/411/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Women lack education and support in child care.

Without reliable access to well-trained healthcare professionals, women in higher-risk pregnancies can experience higher mortality rates due to delayed care, lack of care, and misinformation. After speaking with Plan Canada to gain an understanding of the health workers\u2019 usage of data and the ways they currently gather this information, we learned the gaps in their process. Currently, community health workers do risk assessments during appointments but can\u2019t interpret this information into recommendations on their own. Instead, this information must travel back to their office and be communicated to medical professionals for interpretation. This causes delays in communication and the creation of important care plans. Information can get lost along the way and takes too long to make an impact for these women.\nMeanwhile, women have poor access to accurate health information and may proceed with their pregnancy with misinformation that can be dangerous. They also have limited access to health care workers throughout their pregnancy.\nIn order to tackle this issue we looked at developing a more efficient process for the community health workers that are at the forefront of aiding these women, and created a process that empowers them to plan for their pregnancies without giving up their cultural practices.  </p>\n<h2>Our Solution</h2>\n<p>Our solution is \u201cCall Aunty\u201d! This is a two part program that targets both the community health worker (CHW) as well as the pregnant women (let\u2019s call her Aisha) living in rural Bangladesh. The Call Aunty process starts with a call from Aisha, initially with the help of her CHW during their first appointment. At this point Aisha meets Aunty who asks her a few personal and health related questions to register her into the Call Aunty service. At the end of this call Aunty automatically determines Aisha\u2019s risk level, her estimated due date and gives a brief, tailored recommendation based on the information given. The CHW sees the results of Aisha\u2019s answers on her app as well as the recommendation given by Aunty. \nBased on Aisha\u2019s risk level, Call Aunty schedules automated check-in calls to get updates on any symptoms and revise Aisha\u2019s risk level and recommendations throughout her pregnancy. \nOur goal is to reduce the number of CHW visits needed for low-risk women so that these workers can focus on higher-risk women. </p>\n<h2>Future Development</h2>\n<p>In the future we hope to scale Call Aunty by: \nCreating extensive diagnostic questions and recommendations \nCreating an SMS feature to alert CHWs of appointments and nudge women to follow-through on recommendations\nDevelop a scheduler for CHW to manage appointments\nSupport pre-pregnancy and postnatal (up to a year)\nDevelop a partnership with the government so that they have access to the Call Aunty database in order to make better healthcare resourcing decisions   </p>\n<h2>The Experience</h2>\n<p><strong>Aisha (persona of pregnant women)</strong>\nAisha is a 16 year old married pregnant women living in rural Bangladesh. She is Muslim, only speaks Bengali and has limited education. Aisha\u2019s goals are to have a healthy pregnancy all while fulfilling her duties within her society. She currently understands the traditional methods of dealing with a pregnancy from her elders but sees the women in her life passing away from the lack of healthcare resources and information. </p>\n<p>Benefits to pregnant women: \nAisha is able to get the best recommendations on a regular basis only only through visits from her CHW but also by simply getting in touch with Aunty \nAisha is able to avoid leaving her comfort zone by engaging in a \u201cconversation\u201d with her new and informed Aunty, just like she would in her regular day-to-day life\n Aisha is empowered with tailored health information to manage her pregnancy and care for her baby</p>\n<p><strong>Zainab (persona of Community Health Worker)</strong>\nZainab is a 38 year old woman in rural Bangladesh with basic level of education. She has access to both a smartphone and tablet and uses it during her 800-1000 appointments per month. She has limited training, doesn\u2019t speak english and works very long hours each day. Zainab is typically worried about getting to all ~45 of her appointments per day and therefore does not have enough time to prepare for each. During her appointments she is focused on updating Aisha\u2019s profile with notes and recommendations and therefore needs quick access to her records. Zainab\u2019s ultimate goal is to help her patients survive their pregnancies and early childhood. </p>\n<p>Benefits to Zainab: \nZainab is able to identify high risk pregnancies instantaneously \nZainab has easy access to her patients\u2019 records, risk factors and appointments\nZainab is now able to prioritize high risk pregnancies and make them her greatest focus \nZainab is able to do her job more efficiently \nAunty takes some of the logistical requirements of Zainab\u2019s job off her hands and make her job more efficient (ex. Aunty sends automated reminders for appointments and tracks the patient's\u2019 birth plan and due date) </p>\n<h2>Promotional Strategies</h2>\n<p><strong>Positioning Statement</strong>\nCall Aunty is a free, high quality support system for pregnant women living in rural Bangladesh, that provides them with information and resources to help them actively plan for their pregnancies, in a comfortable and culturally acceptable setting</p>\n<p><strong>Slogan</strong>\n\u201cHave you called Aunty Yet?\u201d </p>\n<p><strong>Target Market</strong></p>\n<p>Pregnant women living in rural Bangladesh \nAges: 16-35 \nEducation: Limited \nReligion: Muslim \nMarital Status: Married \nLanguage: Bengali only \nAccess to Phone: Yes (SMS)\nLifestyle: Very social and relies heavily on elders\u2019 recommendations and guidance </p>\n<p><strong>1. Referral Program (generate awareness)</strong>\nUse influential and credible pregnant women within the rural communities to promote Call Aunty\nIncentive such as no wait time during their next clinical visit is provided to these women when they refer and successfully secure a new user \nWhy: This strategy was chosen because rural Bangladesh is very collective and social. Therefore, successful early adoption relies heavily on word-of-mouth generated by the influential women in the community</p>\n<p><strong>2. Partnership (reminder advertisement)</strong>\nPartner with popular brand in rural Bangladesh (ex. A beauty brand) to incorporate Call Aunty\u2019s phone number, logo and slogan to their packaging\nWhy: This will make Call Aunty\u2019s information more readily available and will prompt the pregnant women to call right away. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lucylow/Call_Aunty\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lucylow/Call_Aunty\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["NatalNet", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/458/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/471/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Initial subscription and survey</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/470/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Question from SMS user</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/469/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Automated response</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/474/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>NatalNet health care worker view of all patients</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/473/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>NatalNet health care worker view of single patient</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/472/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>NatalNet health care worker response form</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"NatalNet \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/452/475/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>SMS view of response from health care worker</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In Bangladesh, the maternal death rate is very high, 194 per 100, 000 live births. Despite a drastic decrease in this number in recent years, it is still around <strong>30 times</strong> as high as the rate in Canada (<em>6.6 per 100,000</em>). In addition to this, a large number of children under the age of 5 lose their lives to causes that would be preventable with pre-and-post-natal health care checkups. Community health care workers are equipped to help, but unable to see many patients who need their assistance. Our inspiration in creating NatalNet was the idea that the prevention of maternal and child mortality could be <strong>simple</strong>. Many of the complications that result in such a high mortality rate are easily avoidable - if mothers are armed with the <strong>ability to learn and ask questions about their health</strong> from medical professionals who have the information but not the time or ability to spread it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>NatalNet is an <strong>SMS</strong> and <strong>web-based</strong> application that works to increase the accessibility of pre-and-post natal care by connecting <strong>experienced community health care professionals</strong> with <strong>expectant and new mothers</strong>. In Bangladesh, there is 50% mobile phone proliferation and 98% of these cell phones are 2G devices, meaning that many soon-to-be mothers have access to an SMS-enabled cell phone. These patients will be able to send <strong>questions and concerns</strong> using their mobile devices, and these questions, along with <strong>images or videos</strong> of potential health issues, will be sent to a qualified health care provider for review and response. All information, questions, and media from a maternal patient will be stored in a unique file to facilitate easier examination by health care staff. Furthermore, our app allows women to sign up for <strong>weekly informational texts messages</strong> which provide both general helpful tips for having a healthy pregnancy as well as tips customized to their current trimester.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>For the back end we implemented <strong>Twilio</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>Express.js</strong>; for the front end we primarily used <strong>Bootstrap</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>This problem presented a unique set of challenges: we initially struggled with launching the <strong>EC2 server instance</strong>, as well as implementing and bringing together the <strong>Twilio</strong> and <strong>Firebase</strong> APIs that we made use of in our application.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>In a hackathon with such a short timeline, creating a functional project was always a bit up in the air. We, as a group, are immensely proud of producing an app that functions <strong>exactly the way we envisioned it</strong>, while implementing several difficult APIs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NatalNet</h2>\n<p>Our database saves all questions and responses as well as information about the woman who asked the question. Therefore once the app has been implemented and our database is large enough, we can use database analytics and natural language processing to send personalized automated responses based on responses originally written by actual Community Health Workers in Bangladesh to women like the 'question-asker'.</p>\n<p>Additional plans:\n<br/>\n<strong>&gt;</strong> Implementation of functionality that allows <strong>multiple different mothers</strong> to access health services via the <strong>same phone number</strong>.\n<br/>\n<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Automatic flagging</strong> of personal data based on health characteristics such as high blood pressure or low weight. <br/>\n<strong>&gt;</strong> <strong>Long term tracking</strong> of common health concerns by region, age, other risk factors, etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ISauve/NatalNet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ISauve/NatalNet\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the back end of the application, which involved developing a RESTful Node.js API using Express.js as well as implementing the Twilio and Firebase APIs.

Living in rural areas often makes accessing essential health care services and information very difficult, especially for vulnerable new mothers and infants. </p>\n<p><strong>Our Solution</strong>\nBorn Ready is an SMS (texting) based service that provides immediate responses to common health care concerns involved with pregnancy, as well as connecting women to health care professionals in their region for safer births. We chose SMS as our form of communication because most people living in Bangladesh have limited access to wifi. Ideally, this will reduce infant and maternal mortality, especially in high-risk pregnancies.</p>\n<p>Community healthcare workers currently serve as a strong connection between people and medical professionals in Bangladesh. However, they are responsible for around 600 households and record the majority of their information on paper. This is a lot of work and makes tracking the health of especially vulnerable people very difficult. </p>\n<p>With our service, community healthcare workers can input essential information of pregnant women through SMS to our database. They can query the database later as necessary. This organized and systematic collection of information increases accountability and makes processing data (by the government or as part of research projects) much easier. As the pregnancy progresses, both the woman and CHW will receive frequent alerts and reminders to provide further medical information. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sms</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ngork</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">venv</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">csv</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TwinkleMehta/BornReady\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TwinkleMehta/BornReady\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on building the Flask web server, twilio, and attempted to interface with MySQL database ", "", "", ""]], ["SchoolMS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Breaking Inequality</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for SchoolMS</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/amytx/SCHOOLMS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/amytx/SCHOOLMS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Modoula", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Pregnancy-Risk-Tracker</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nwrahnem/Pregnancy-Risk-Tracker\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nwrahnem/Pregnancy-Risk-Tracker\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped to come up with and iron out most of the ideas for this project and how it would come together.

I also really like the ideas we had and how much we managed to get done. It was great working with such creative thinkers. Even though it was their first time, we all managed to get into the top 10 teams.", "", "", "", ""]]]
