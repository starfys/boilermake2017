A ready check is where each user is asked the basic question - are you ready? Each user then says yes - I am ready, or no - I am not ready. After each user is polled, a message is sent out that simply says \"Go\", to notify each user that the group is ready.</p>\n<p>Because the question is so vague, the meaning is left up to each group of users to decide. You could be asking if they're ready for a car pool in the morning, or ready for your evening workout with friends. What is normally a repetitive tedious messaging thread of asking these simple question is now simplified into a robust, easy, and real-time mobile app.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Android and firebase.

We wanted to bridge the gap between the amazing computational power that computers offer in terms of chess analysis and the physical experience of playing on a wooden chess board.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The raw video stream is first processed in order to detect the corners of the chess board. Then, those corners are mapped to a perfect 320x320 square representing the chess board. The occupancy state of the board is then determined at each frame, which is used to find out which move has been made using state-machine logic. Finally, the position is sent to a server we built which analyzes it and finds a \"best\" move. This move is then communicated to the user.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Used several image/video processing techniques from the opencv library along with raw matrix transformations to obtain a state in which each square on the chess board is being tracked. The differences in occupancy states of the board are used to find which moves were made. These moves are then sent to back-end server to be processed.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There was a lot of noise that had to be cleaned up when trying to process a video stream and detect changes. Also, finding the thresholds to determine if there is a piece on the square or not was a tedious process (it is difficult to detect white pieces on white squares and black pieces on black squares).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Actually having a computer track a chess game through a camera is pretty cool. Also, hooking up the most powerful chess engine in the world to your back-end to find moves is nice accomplishment we're proud of.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Image/video processing is difficulty ... very difficult.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ultimate Chess Hack</h2>\n<p>Having more subtle ways for the back-end to communicate the chess move to the player for some not-so-fair game-play ;)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/akhilles/hackru_2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/akhilles/hackru_2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Who's Pinging Me?", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It displays a graphical representation*NOTE* You MUST run it using administrator, otherwise the program cannot access the log files.

To understand the full meaning and reason behind such a beautiful nickname, you must first delve into the dark, painful, unforgiving hole named Cancer.</p>\n<p>Cancer took something from me that I never had. Something I can never touch, or hold, or laugh with. Something that never tucked me in, cradled me or spoiled me with ice cream, cheek pulling and kisses.  Cancer took both my grandparents before I was born. Robbing me of simple pleasures which make me envious of my friends.  The stories I hear about them from my mother, make me feel a deep sadness.  Can one truly mourn something they never had? People they never met? There were no sleepovers at grandmas house or playing catch with grandpa in the backyard.  Can I miss the delicious Italian meals my grandmother used to make, even though I have never tasted them? My grandpa, or Poppaloonie, as he was known to the other grandchildren who had the luck of being born early enough know him, was a semi-pro baseball player.  For me, there was no one at the other end of the mound to catch my lopsided and sometimes misguided pitches. Instead, my single mother tried her best to be my coach,  always telling me how proud Poppaloonie would have been of me.When she cooks, I listen intently to the stories she tells me about large family gatherings and how the smell of meatballs cooking on a Sunday  afternoon could make even the sleepiest little boy spring from his bed with delight. With the death of my grandparents, the large family became smaller and the glue that held them together was no longer there. Gatherings turned into phone calls and Sunday dinner became take out. One word, one disease, would change generations and traditions forever. Cancer.</p>\n<p>My grandmother was diagnosed with vaginal cancer in 1990.  A rare form of cancer, one of 16 known cases at that time. She endured radiation treatments in  New Jersey an attempt to shrink the tumor which grew at the end of her urethra.  A more aggressive approach was needed and she was moved to Sloan Kettering in New York City.  There they tried a then experimental procedure where a chip was placed inside her that would emit radiation to eradicate the tumor. Radiation does not discriminate. While attacking the cancer cells, it also destroyed, healthy, living, viable cells throughout her pelvic region.  The damage cost her her bladder and she had to wear a urostomy bag. She was growing very weak and required a good amount of care which costs a great deal of money.  My Poppaloonie had to retire early to take care of her.  My mother had to eventually leave her job of 15 years to help take care of my grandmother full time.  All of the money they worked so hard to save, was now being eaten up by this disease. What would be my college fund - depleted. Things became much worse when sores began to appear all over my grandmothers body.  They were from the radiation and they formed from the inside out.  By the time they revealed themselves at the top level, they were virtual craters deep in her skin. The hospitals in New Jersey didn\u2019t know what to do.  They had never seen anything like it before.  They wore protective suits and quarantined her for weeks. Radiation. What they used to kill the cancer, was now killing my grandmother.The radiation had done so much damage to her pelvis that the blood was not flowing down her legs. At this point she had given up fighting, cancer seemed to be winning by beating her down and throwing one thing after another at her.  She ignored the discoloration of her feet and began to wear socks. By the time she was taken to New York Hospital, both her lower legs and feet were black.  She had gangrene.  Her left leg was amputated below the knee the next morning and shunts were put in the other leg to try to get the blood flowing. After 3 months of debridement, shunts, and operations, her right leg was amputated above the knee. She could not be fitted with prosthetics due to the fact that her wounds were not healing. The amputation incisions on her legs never fully healed and for months she remained in the hospital having debridement after debridement.  At this point the left leg was taken over the knee. She lost more and more of her legs, until there was no more leg to take.  She weighed 53 pounds. The doctor told my mother that they had done all they could and that my grandmother had 1 week to live.  She died 8 days later on November 4, 2005. </p>\n<p>A few months after my grandmother\u2019s funeral, my Poppaloonie revealed that he was ill, and explained that he did not say anything because his first priority was taking care of my grandmother. By the time my mother took him to the doctor, he had Stage 4 lung cancer.  He began radiation and chemotherapy but the cancer spread to his brain.  After seeing what my grandmother went through and her attempts to survive, he signed a DNR.  On October 13, 2006, one day after his 63rd birthday, my Poppaloonie was gone.</p>\n<p>At his funeral, my mother was understandably inconsolable and ill,having lost both parents in the span of 1 year.  She was severely depressed and suicidal when she was taken to the hospital the next day.  It was then she found out that she was pregnant with me.  The light in the darkness.  The one small ray of hope that says things will get better and life must go on. A sunshine angel boy.</p>\n<p>And now that hope must once again resurface as my mother was recently diagnosed with Multiple sclerosis. Unlike cancer, Multiple Sclerosis is not in the media's spotlight, it does not have to be tracked by the CDC, nor from my point of view does it seem to have enough attention and funding. That is why my team and I worked to increase the awareness of MS by spreading information in a way people would enjoy. I just hope that as I continue to spread awareness we a a world grow closer to a cure. In the end, I just hope that I can stop or prevent theses tragedies from occurring in someone else's life.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Show information about the how people in different regions are diagnosed in order to increase public awareness about common early signs of MS. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using googles WebGL globe api in javascript, and we pre-processed data in Matlab and Excel</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Having a significant amount of data and taking too time to calculate the boundaries of countries </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made a working application and have it running through git hub one of my members did not know how to code at all and I feel that we taught him a lot.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about the sizing of data, efficiency in large number computing, and basic java script</p>\n<h2>What's next for MS Globe</h2>\n<p>I want to see MS globe expand in new ways including how treatments varied by region, what common options people take to acclimate to life after getting diagnosed and so on. Additionally, I hope to see this kind of presentation representing other disease and just help increase the public in order to make our first steps towards change.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/excel\">excel</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Project Firefly", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zt6ym_ibw0Y?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/193/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/047/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/048/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/055/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/044/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/059/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/046/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/049/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Project Firefly \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/432/057/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_painting\" rel=\"nofollow\">Light Painting</a> is an photographic technique which is made by taking a long exposure photograph on moving handheld sources of light. There are several problems with this approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is no feedback system. The artist is unable to see exactly what they're drawing</li>\n<li>There is a limited amount of time to take a long exposure shot, and on top of that there are no room for mistakes</li>\n<li>It's a difficult technique; creating complex art requires practice and skill</li>\n<li>All artwork made with conventional light painting techniques seem hand-drawn. It looks like someone just drew their artwork with a marker</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>So in traditional light painting the artist just sets the camera to long exposure and waves a flashlight around at it to create their artwork. So, what if you had 288 LEDs on a two meter long stick? One can upload an image to this stick, then hold it upright, and as they move it through 3D space, the stick scans through the image and shoots out each column of pixels in light. It's essentially a 3D light printer.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Raspberry Pi 3, a two-meter-long strip of 288-LED tape we soldered together, a breadboard, and various electrical components for our circuits. The Raspberry Pi intakes images through a USB drive and processes them with code in Python and C. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Due to the nature of the hack and how we were building custom circuits for it, we were not able to afford any mistakes in our circuitry because that could potentially damage the Raspberry Pi or the LED tape or any other of the irreplaceable components we used. A lot of these components are expensive and thus any error could be very very very very very catastrophic. As a result, precision soldering and an insane amount of testing/sanity-checking was of upmost importance. We would test a circuit a couple times before soldering/assembling, then test it a couple times while soldering, and then test it three times after soldering.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>One of our member who rarely do hardware projects learned about connecting circuits, how to use a soldering iron, and how to connect hardware to the raspberry Pi. As a team we also learned how to do hardware unit and integration testing for hardware.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project Firefly</h2>\n<p>We are thinking of using a bigger stick or smaller LEDs for higher resolution picture. We are also thinking of mounting a small camera on the stick to record video while taking pictures.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">camera</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["C.A.R.E.

The kiosk has common scenarios embedded into the reporting system. So, if one of the specific issues are relevant to the user, they can ask for the scenario to be executed, and select relevant services. The user also has an \"other\" option, in which they can type their input, to ensure that all user cases are provided for. The proper authorities receive a text message that notifies them of the type of accident and the location.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This web app was built with the Ember API on the client side. Based on user's selected situations, the client sends an http request to the server-side. The server side is written with node.js and implements the Twillio API that handles the http requests by creating and sending text messages to specified emergency services.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, our group struggled with coming up for an idea to pursue during the hackathon. There are many different implementations for the ideas that we threw around so deciding to choose one posed a problem as well. Once we finally decided to pursue an idea that worked with the Innovate NB kiosks, we were met with the challenge of learning new platforms and technologies that none of us were used to, such as ember.js and node.js. There were also problems with creating multiple actions, formatting the code, and simply making the application look good.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our group walked into this project without knowing each other and without knowing all the technologies we were required to used. Nonetheless, we were able to complete the project without \"butting heads.\" We are also proud of some things within the code as well, such as getting Twilio to send specific issue requests to the proper authorities. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Technologically wise, we learned about new applications for different languages and gained more JavaScript experience. We also learned how to work with people that we are not necessarily familiar with in order to accomplish a common goal. </p>\n<h2>What's next for C.A.R.E. (Emergency Services)</h2>\n<p>Right now C.A.R.E. is purely a text-to-911 application, however we hope to expand its capabilities to include voice, photo, and real-time communication.

One day, a mobile named Chicken Spin was born, fulfilling Chris' curiosity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>But today, we've made a sequel to the legendary game, implementing first-person shooter mechanics with the joys of spinning chickens.</p>\n<p>Bailey - Its a simple FPS for mobile where people shoot chickens that spin at JIMMY NEUTRONS(placeholder) for 60 seconds. The player can control his movement forwards and backwards and his left right camera movements with several buttons. The chickens will fly out from the direction the player is facing and bounce around objects until they despawn or hit a Neutron.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>With Unity in C# and Blender to make most of the object models.\nBailey - We first made the models from scratch and the game scene. We then created a player and a camera that followed him. Then we made a gui for controlling his movements. we then figured out hot to make static chickens appear in front of him where the gun would be(the gun is nothing more than a monkey face attached to a cyllinder mesh). Next, we had the chickens become rigidbodies with physics as well as decay so we didn't flood the scene with chicken clones. Then we made the \"arena\" and start and game over screens.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Mostly the lack of time, we should have started earlier for we could have gotten more done if he had done so. Also our unfamiliarity with Unity and C# meant a lot of time looking up errors that ended up being pretty simple. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Making a game that did not crash upon startup.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that we definitely need to do this again. Its sometimes easier to make a chicken mesh from scratch than try to fix one. We gained a lot of useful experience with C# and Unity that would definitely streamline the process of making this and let us make a more fully fleshed out program</p>\n<h2>What's next for Chicken Spin 2</h2>\n<p>Multiplayer and leaderboards.</p>\n<p>Bailey -  Better controls for the camera and better implementing the gun mechanics. We would definitely also add an actual arena and something to replace the Jimmy Neutrons and gun models. Also a new thumbnail, the next Chicken Spin will definitely not have Lubu aggressively chugging Pepsi with a chicken in front of him as its thumbnail. We also need to make things more efficient and take less space a lot of our algorithms could be improved heavily.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender\">blender</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gimp\">gimp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chris-gong/chickenspin2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chris-gong/chickenspin2\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["test2", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>test</p>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
