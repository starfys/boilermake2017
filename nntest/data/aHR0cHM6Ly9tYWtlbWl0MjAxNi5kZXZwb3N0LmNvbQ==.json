To go along with the shockingly well cooked hotdog, it toasts a bun by blasting it with a heat gun. Finally, it allows you to customize flavor by topping it off with your choice of condiments.</p>\n<h2><em>Why?</em></h2>\n<p>The first reason should be obvious - because <em>we felt like it</em>. The other reason, however, is more nuanced.</p>\n<p>An unarguable trend in modern technology is the steady growth of automation. Every day is marked by the reduction of what humans <em>need</em> to do and an advance in what human creations <em>can</em> do. Our project stands as an example of the unrealized potential of this trend; we took a simple, time-consuming task and stripped it of the latter trait.</p>\n<h2>How?</h2>\n<p>One of the most important tenants of design in automation is reliability; as you may have noticed, we took this to heart. The frame of the machine is built from 80/20 and Derlin and has all the delicacy of a wrecking ball. Its intelligence, thankfully, exceeds that of a wrecking ball due an Arduino Uno that regulates the movements of the machine.</p>\n<p>Hotdogs are fed in from the top and regulated by a stepper motor mounted to a set of 3D-printed sprockets. Once fed in, they are pinned on either side by bladed electrodes. A relay activates, and 1000 watts are passed through the hotdog; the unique cooking process heats the hotdog from the inside out within a few moments.The hotdog is then dispensed into the mouth of a hotdog bun - and, hopefully, into the mouth of a hungry user.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">80/20</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">a-lot-of-80/20</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Can't HANDle this!", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Can't HANDle this! \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/523/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Can't HANDle this! \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/282/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Can't HANDle this! \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/259/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>PHASE 1: We knew of a project that would move a robot hand using mimicry and wanted to tweak it a little bit to do different formations like making a fist, peace sign, point, and spiderman pose/ rock fingers.\nPHASE 2: We thought it would be cool if we could move an entire arm.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PHASE 1: You can control a hand and make it make different formations using signals from motions from a different hand.\nPHASE 2: Using bluetooth and arduino, you can control a hand to make a grip and move the elbow. We wanted it to also move the entire arm up and down (so from the shoulder) but we didn't get all of our motors in time and just improvised.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>PHASE 1: We made contraptions to hold fingers, ran a string through them, tied them to motors that spun using arduino that would get signals from flex sensors from a different hand.\nPHASE 2: We built the exoskeleton for the entire arm with a stepper motor at the elbow so the forearm can move up and down. We made a similar thing to hold the fingers but instead of each finger connected to an individual servo, we connected all the fingers to one since we only want it to grip now. We also made an android and iOS app to control the movements of the arm through arduino and bluetooth.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>PHASE 1: Autodesk didn't work, 3d printer failed, servos are locked, and soldering stations closed.\nPHASE 2: We had trouble putting everything together (arduino code, bluetooth, and the physical exoskeleton). We had the most trouble with getting the arduino to communicate with bluetooth. We also weren't aware that the bluetooth shield we got was only for Android until after our iOS app developer made the app. So, he had to learn how to make an Android app last minute. Also the shoulder strap wasn't strong enough to hold the entire exoskeleton for a while which is why we added a rope to go around the neck for more support. Parts, especially the motors, batteries, and one 3d print, didn't come in on time for us to implement them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The design is pretty sick, we learned how to make an app in Android, and we somehow hooked it up to Bluetooth.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>PHASE 1: We learned how to use autodesk, how to code in arduino, how to use a glue gun, and how to solder.\nPHASE 2: We learned how to make an app using Android studio, implement bluetooth, how to use shields, and more about coding in Arduino.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Your other hand</h2>\n<p>PHASE 1: We want to hook it up to Microsoft band, wirelessly send signals, and 360 spinning servos. \nPHASE 2: We were successful at making it wireless (which is something we had absolutely no idea how to do)! We want to move the entire arm (from the shoulder) up and down. We also want to hook it up to an iOS app which we would be able to do if we had used a more versatile Bluetooth shield.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">flex-resistors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/servo\">servo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/autodesk\">autodesk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stepper-motor</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Align", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Align \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/526/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Align</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As students, we sit a lot, and it leads to bad posture.

When the user reverts to a bad posture, Align activates a buzzer at the problem area as a reminder to straighten up.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built it with a set of flex sensors. The flex sensor works by changing its resistance when it is curved. By strategically placing the sensors along the spine and shoulder, we can detect the user's back position.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The sensors broke so we had allow for engineering fail-safes such as hot gluing all the connections. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The sensors are very sensitive and detect even slight changes in posture.

We were also a lot more organized with our wiring. With the use of a photon, we were able to make our device smaller and wifi enable our device, making the user interphase wireless. We also developed an app that our users can utilize to calibrate and control settings for our product. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Align</h2>\n<p>Next stop for Align is integrating it into a comfortable and discrete tank top.

We felt inspired by the numerous possibilities that such a machine could bring both to public health and research. With automatic pipetting, we can potentially address the numerous health problems, such as the feeble reach of health diagnostics in society today. We decided to build an application machine of the mobile cloud lab</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mobile Diagnostics provide a framework to screen for serious diseases and illnesses, such as cancer, renal diseases, autoimmune diseases, diabetes, and other chronic and/or serious ailments. Using the automate pipetting procedures for experiments in Mobile Cloud Lab we've built before, we can create an autonomous machine in the household that keeps constant vigilance on the health of its owners. People merely have to input a little saliva in to the machine, and the machine returns the physical health of the user. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a physical frame with aluminum rods. We then used Arduino and Raspberry Pi to automate the pipetting procedures in cloud software. The design of the project is inspired by the systematic framework of 3D printers. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We struggled initially to 3D print and laser cut everything within the time limit. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of Mobile Diagnostic's improved functionality, stability, and exterior design as well as it's increased scope. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to implement microprocessors, use Arduinos, design basic hardware, and work in teams in highly stressful settings. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Mobile Diagnostics</h2>\n<p>We would like to acquire more biomedical medium to make Mobile Diagnostics a commercial product.

We also wanted to design a simple, connected device that provides real value to end users. We thought the kitchen had many areas for improvement that could benefit from connected devices. We wanted to create something totally different and fun.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Scipio listens to the cook's voice for hands free operation. The user simply tells Scipio the type and quantity of spices it needs for a recipe and Scipio will measure and dispense the correct amount of spices every time. \nWith the most recent revision, we made it able to maintain a continuous, unrestricted spin which allows the product to work faster and more efficiently.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Amazon Echo and it's voice control capabilities to run the interaction modeling and process the voice inputs. We then send an HTTP POST request to the Particle Photon. This method enables the two devices to interact wirelessly. The user can simply place their Amazon Echo in the custom fit enclosure and cook away.The second revision, we laser cut both the circular frames and gears to propel the spice rack around much more precisely than our old design.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Additionally, the number of 3d printed parts the dispensers required slowed down the production considerably and we ended up scaling down the number of dispensers. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of how robust the mechanical design is. We feel that the design of the rotating auger wheels were a good innovation and are a viable option for deploying in a final design. We are also very proud that we were able to learn a lot about using Amazon Echo / Alexa and creating interaction models for speech recognition and processing. We added the ability to ask for multiple spice requests in a single go, increasing the speed at which Spicio can aid you and your cooking needs.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Speech recognition can be more than just gimmicky technology. It can provide real value, especially when applied in unexpected areas.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Spicio</h2>\n<p>We plan to implement the Food2Fork API to allow the user to ask for recipe suggestions. We would also like to implement more kitchen functionality including cooking tips and tricks as well as suggestions on spice combinations. Further down the road, we think it would be cool to integrate ingredient ordering through BlueApron or Amazon Fresh.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/servo\">servo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">80/20</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/autodesk-fusion-360\">autodesk-fusion-360</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kinex</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">markforged</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Bicyclight", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C92LuIE8wHs?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bicyclight \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/483/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Project logo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bicyclight \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/217/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>R1: Justin with the Bicyclight</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bicyclight \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/228/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>R1: Backpack mount</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bicyclight \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/543/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>R2: Custom wearable</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Bicyclight \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/544/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>R2: Light module</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Revision 2</h2>\n<h3>Improvements to Revision 1</h3>\n<p><strong>Mobility</strong>\nSmaller, flexible enclosure ideal for portability.

He was changing lanes into the bike lane, holding out his hand to signal, when a car behind him rushed past and hit him from the side. Luckily he only took minor scratches, but it left him thinking: can't there be a better way to illuminate cyclists at night?</p>\n<p>Enter: the Bicyclight, an intelligent gesture-controlled bike signaling system. A new way to illuminate your ride.</p>\n<h3>What it does</h3>\n<p>The Bicyclight takes information about the user's current speed/acceleration and arm position, and outputs a lighting pattern to enhance safety of the cyclist, especially during lane changes.</p>\n<p>Here's how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Before your ride, put on a Myo armband and turn on the Bicyclight.</li>\n<li>During your ride, signal as you would normally, with standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_signals\" rel=\"nofollow\">hand turn signals</a>.

However, there are 285 million visually impaired people around the world, with 130,000 visually impaired people in the U.S. alone. Many visually impaired have to read through Braille texts or listen to audio files, and unfortunately less than 1% of all books are in Braille and less than 30% of all books have an audio version. In addition, Braille displays and embossers cost thousands of dollars, making them inaccessible to many of the visually impaired people living in developing countries. The mission of Tactile is to empower the visually impaired through education equality by enabling them to have the opportunity to access all printed texts.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our innovation allows real-time conversion of printed text to Braille. Ultimately, a visually impaired person would use the portable scanner to scan the text from the spine of a book to the outer edge of the book. The scanner would transfer information to a refreshable Braille display wirelessly, and the visually impaired would be able to read the Braille text and repeat the same process to read the next page. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Codes don\u2019t work.

One of our team members has personal experience with being in a road accident, where she wishes she had that 3 seconds in advance to react.\nOur city, Toronto, has been identified as a \u201cwalkable\u201d city, one that promotes and supports walking, cycling, and transit over driving automated vehicles. We extended this experience of auditory isolation and sensory deficiency in a helmet on the roadway to being hearing impaired as a driver. As reported by the Participation and Activities Limitations Survey (PALS) in 2006, 5% of Canadians aged fifteen and older have hearing limitations, 16.8% of which are profoundly Deaf, equating to approximately 200,000 people. Upon research, it was found that multiple deaf cyclist communities exist globally. Wearable technologies and sensing technology are pushing the envelope in innovation globally. The deaf cyclist combined with the motorist community, were communities that we felt we could try to impact at the hardware hackathon. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The system consists of 2 sensors located in the same housing, mounted on top of a helmet. The housing has module attachment modes for cyclists and motorcyclists alike.</p>\n<p>A microphone mounted on the back of the helmet records sounds from behind the cyclist and determines its frequencies using a Fast Fourier Transform through the Arduino. Based on these frequencies, the it is determined if the sound is a bike bell, car horn, or simply noise.<br/>\nAn ultrasound sensor on the back of the helmet computes the velocity of rear approaching traffic by sampling the distance of the traffic for set intervals of time. \nBoth sensors send signals to the Arduino Uno which relays the signal to 2 LEDs. The red LED lights if the sound frequency or velocity threshold. The green LED lights if a bike bell frequency is sensed.</p>\n<p>Mounting the LEDs:\nThe LEDs are contained in a flexible velcro band. The band allows for modularity in any bike helmet attachment. One half of the velcro attaches to the underside of the front of the helmet; the other half contains the LEDs. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We started by building the frequency detector and velocity sensor on two separate Arduinos. The frequency detector was based on the code for an Arduino-based music equalizer (linked below), adjusted for sound-based warnings of the road. Meanwhile, the velocity sensor was prototyped using a photoresistor, which determined the position of an object at two locations and calculated its location. As well, the mounting system for the sensors and LEDs was modeled using AutoDesk and prototyped (in the physical world) using a cardboard helmet and the combined Arduino systems for the two types of sensors.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We encountered many, many challenges over the hectic 15 hours, ranging from figuring out the code for the Fast Fourier Transform, debugging circuits, learning AutoDesk/unlearning our bad habits from SolidWorks, grappling with our attempts to make a bluetooth-connected system, and struggling to combine the two Arduino systems.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I\u2019m proud that each of us learned new skills as a team and applied it in a way that can benefits a real community facing real problems in our city. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our team learned a ton at this hackathon, from coding in Arduino, debugging circuits, doing CAD in AutoDesk, and working on a team under pressure. We also learned that calibration and assembling physical components is a big deal when our functional prototype is under judging.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Galea Helmet</h2>\n<p>Our system, being helmet-mounted, has its own pros and cons. Although the risk of theft is reduced and it requires minimal added purchases for the user, it affects the feel of the helmet and limits our scope to the cyclists that use helmets in the first place. One next step could be to mount the sensors on the bike frame itself and give haptic cues via a vibration on an armband or phone.</p>\n<p>Another aspect is that the Galea Helmet uses code from the <a href=\"http://elm-chan.org/works/akilcd/report_e.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ffft library from ELM-ChaN</a> and the <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/piccolo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Piccolo music visualizer from Adafruit</a>. While these resources were a great launchpad for making a prototype of our design, they did have a few problems for our application. For instance, ffft library didn\u2019t specify the units of its output, making calibration pretty difficult. Next time we\u2019ll work on writing/using libraries that better fit our purposes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">product-design</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["(5) Fine Adaptive Sport Support", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"(5) Fine Adaptive Sport Support \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/266/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"(5) Fine Adaptive Sport Support \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/271/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"(5) Fine Adaptive Sport Support \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/272/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"(5) Fine Adaptive Sport Support \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/274/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"(5) Fine Adaptive Sport Support \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/275/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"(5) Fine Adaptive Sport Support \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/276/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Any athlete knows the value of having one-on-one coaching time. Why not get a machine to tell you what you're doing wrong? Our team's mission was to create a device with the ability to give precision feedback without the assistance of a professional.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Fine Adaptive Sport Support system tracks the fine movements of the arm and wrist and analyzes it. It compares the incoming data to a training set created by recorded samples that corresponded with correct gestures and successful results in any number of tasks. By pinpointing the exact variables, or specific motions, whose changes correlate with undesirable outcomes, and providing them to the wearer in an understandable way, FASS effectively coaches its user to perfection.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>FASS is made of several gyro/accelerometer sensors placed along the arm and integrated into an Arduino board and Wifi shield. The first step was to design and test the circuitry for the sensors and the connection to the board. Then deciding the practical aspect of how to wear the tech followed along with connecting all the parts together in a flexible, nonrestrictive way. One important factor to consider was that the wearer's motion is not inhibited by incorporating too many sensors or poorly designing the straps to be worn directly on the moving parts of the body. After getting motion data read by the sensors, the next step was getting the software analysis of the data. We had to interpret the gyro/accelerometer readings and draw meaningful conclusions from them. The main implementation for finding variables variables that correlated with successful attempts was an artificial neural network. The aim was to collect data from a set of sample motions and manually input their success or failed outcomes through buttons integrated integrated in the circuitry.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Circuitry was complex and detailed. Time pressure.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Putting something together. We all worked hard and we made something new that we believe to be of value and have potential to make a difference.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Circuitry is hard. But all the members of our team got a chance to try soldering and we all tried helping with different parts of the project (the coding, the designing, the building, and the testing). Preparation was key. Having a solid idea and a great team makes the whole experience a lot of fun.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fine Adaptive Sport Support</h2>\n<p>Moving the computing from a laptop to mobile platforms like phones, adding more sensors, eventually returning more feedback including biometric sensors like temperature and heartrate as well as environmental variables. This could enable us to market to sports teams as well as amateurs. And because of its versatility, it could be used in virtually any sport. One additional potential application is in physical therapy by making the chance for improvement available to more people, especially those who cannot afford a personal physical therapist.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["StarKey", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StarKey \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/318/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In my house, my parents have taken care of my grandparents after my grandfather had a stroke.

We developed a projector out of a magnifying glass and phone screen in order to show their turning and stopping, but it was not bright enough to demo. Changing our plan, we decided to improve the cycling experience by providing live speed and incline feedback to aid in training. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our device gives us real time feedback on a bicycle's velocity and incline angle, while providing suggested gears for elite cyclists to improve their efficiency. Where typical training tools like Strava give post-ride feedback, our device allows the rider to improve their performance in real time. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>To track speed, we built an optical encoder using a custom built checkered wheel, an LED and a photocell. Using a Photon and an external cell phone battery, all connected in a sleek package, the photocell records revolutions of the checkered wheel. From this, translational velocity is computed. Additionally, an IMU was implemented to detect the angle of incline the rider experiences when traveling on hills. These two data points allow a gear suggestion for the rider. This data is transmitted wirelessly to a web-based UI, where the rider can see live data of their performance. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating the code between the IMU and the Photon proved to be difficult. Generating consistent data from the optical encoder independent of the ambient lighting conditions was also challenging. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Wireless data transmission near real time. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to use the Photon API and I2C communication. How to develop an optical encoder. </p>\n<h2>What's next for LiveRider</h2>\n<p>Connect with the Microsoft Band to be able to see real time data in a compact and convenient form. Increasing the resolution on the optical encoder. Better estimates of velocity and orientation using filters. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photon</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">disney-battery</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">imu</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">aslkdf</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photoresistor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">optical-encoder</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://18.111.34.6:8000/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://18.111.34.6:8000/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>18.111.34.6</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["SleepingAzure", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SleepingAzure \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/229/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>working hard to get this finished</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SleepingAzure \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/231/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our hardware just about to be connected</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SleepingAzure \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/233/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The team having fun</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SleepingAzure \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/234/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The pillow that we put the elctronics in.

Often, candy is what makes us persevere through the night. Being engineers, we wanted to devise a new way to dispense candy just by asking a machine to do it. Hence the M^2 Candy Dispenser came to existence.</p>\n<p>However, we also have other visions for this projects. It can be used by parents to know the number of times their children get candy. Most of all, it can be used by blind or disabled people to obtain anything that fits into the dispenser without touching the machine.</p>\n<p>M^2 works by using Amazon Echo to understand a voice command and turns the machine on to dispense an item - in our case, candy. It works like any other candy dispenser, except that the M^2 offers its dispensing capabilities to a wider population.</p>\n<p>We wanted to explore the prototyping and creative powers of K'Nex, so we explored how to assemble the frame of our dispensing machine from the K'Nex parts. We used a modified water bottle to dispense the candy, and we wired a motor and the Echo to power the dispenser work. Since our project is a candy-themed one, we made sure to use as many colors as possible to liven up our project. </p>\n<p>One of our biggest challenges was to use a raspberry pi and Amazon Echo to switch on our device based on voice commands because it was our first time using either tools.

The inspiration came from the fact that the alien could translate to another wall if the current path was impossible to go through. The idea then came to us to develop a toy that could produce this same concept: maneuver 3 Dimensional pieces to allow a \"character\" to pass. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>There are a set of 3D puzzle pieces that a user can use to place inside <strong>Tunnel Vision</strong>. They can rotate and secure the pieces through a washer and screw system. The user then must place the mouse on top of the puzzle, place the lid of the box on top, and try to maneuver the mouse from the top to the bottom by translating and rotating puzzle pieces. It is simplistic in design and able to be used as people can be designers of the puzzles or solvers. In addition, the size of Tunnel Vision is travel friendly. Anyone can take it wherever they go. Friends can develop simple to complex maps to challenge other friends to get the mouse from the top of the box to the bottom. This product is targeted towards children and teenagers. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We made the puzzle pieces out of layers of foam core, screws, and washers. The Tunnel Vision body was lasercut, acrylic and we assembled it using epoxy, superglue, and K'nex pieces.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We took a lot of time in the beginning to plan out our course of action. We compared and contrasted different design types for geometries of puzzles and how we could make it more user friendly. Being able to carefully plan made the execution very smooth.

The position of that person is sent to an Arduino-controlled machine that swivels and tilts and uses a cross-bow inspired linear accelerator to send a cookie flying in a perfect arc toward the user. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We made full use of the materials and resources available to us. Tiffany and Radha made and modified several DXF and STL files for the laser cutters and 3D printers. Most of those parts ended up being used in the structure of the CLauncher. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The real problems with our project revolved around a lack of suitable motors and difficulties with the Kinect. The stepper motors we initially chose to use were not nearly strong enough to control the azimuth and the 'pull-back' action of the launcher, so we ended up using DC motors with a complex system of pulleys to reduce the torque required by the motors. We also had trouble setting up the libraries and dependencies required to develop applications for the Kinect, which set back progress for a while. However our main programmer Teddy was able get a working program in the end.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The pulley system. The underpowered stepper motors seemed like a dealbreaker at first, but the pulley system provided a viable alternative that used more powerful but less precise motors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*That it works.

The last week of March will be RAK week here at MIT, started by our very own group member Bettina Arkhurst. The goal is to go about the week doing random acts of kindness for anyone at all and hoping to brighten their day even if it is just a little bit. We want every MIT student to know that they are cared for and we are all here for each other. The aim of our project was to create a hack for use during RAK week. </p>\n<p>This hack would take pictures of people and add them to a slideshow full of happy pictures of other MIT students. It would be alerted by a motion sensor that would go off when a person waved at the camera. Additionally we would have a poster for people to hold up during their picture!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Rasberry pi camera to function as the sensor and also take the pictures of the students. The light component consists of 6 LEDs (2 blue, 2 red, and 2 yellow), 6 330 Ohm resistors and and Iduino Uno. The lights smoothly cycle through multiple colors to create a soothing effect. Since the overall shape of the project is a heart, a warm soothing feeling really compliments the effect we are going for. The lights will light up the heart like we hope the heart will light up someone's day. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was difficult to work with the Rasberry Pi since it was our first time using it. There were also a lot of time contrains and we were unable to get all the pieces we wanted printed on the 3D printer.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we have jumped started our hack and will be able to continue to work on it for display in March and we are excited that we got the camera working and taking pictures!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Random Acts of Kindness</h2>\n<p>What is next is a surprise and you will just have to wait for RAK week to find out ;)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rasberry-pi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">acrylic</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">monitor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">led</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["kinect-copter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"kinect-copter \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/346/107/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Breadboard, Arduino, and Quadcopter Controller!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>You can use your hand to control the movement of the quadcopter. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We track the movement of a user's right hand with a kinect 2.
