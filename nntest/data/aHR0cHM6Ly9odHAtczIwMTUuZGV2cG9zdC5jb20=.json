Eventually we settled on making a dashboard to sort of visualize what is going on in your Venmo account. But as we kept building, we kept adding more and more features utilizing Venmo's fairly open and rich API that the original simple visualization platform we wanted to create in the beginning had become a larger platform. Venmo Dash is now a web application that allows users to see where their money is going, who it's going to, create payments and charges, as well as schedule future payments and create recurring payments.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>After the user logs in through the splash page, a simple but informative dashboard page is displayed to the user. From here, the user is presented with a donut chart displaying net gains and losses through their use of the platform as well as who the money is going to in the form of friend cards containing names, user_ids, and a horizontal bar chart.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the user can schedule future payments and recurring payments through the pop-open forms right below the main profile view. Here, the user can specify exactly when the payment or charge should go through.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>While the Venmo web application itself isn't exceptionally feature rich, Venmo's APIs are extremely open and extensible which allows almost any possible application to build on top of Venmo. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Venmo Dash</h2>\n<p>Additional analytics, forecasting, predictive reminders, more visualizations etc.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/venmo\">venmo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chartist</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://venmo-dash.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://venmo-dash.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>venmo-dash.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/charleslai/venmo-dash\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/charleslai/venmo-dash\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["pebble pouch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pebble pouch \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/612/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pebble pouch \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/677/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pebble pouch \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/680/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"pebble pouch \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/681/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We're college students. We balance our social lives with our wallet--but sometimes it can be difficult. When we need to decide in a few seconds whether or not we'll order that late night boba or last-minute trip off campus, we don't have time to log on with our browsers to access our bank account balance. That's where \"pebble pouch\" comes in.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Pebble pouch can help people of all ages meet their budgeting goals. All you need is a smartphone (Android or iOS!) and a Pebble! Set a timeline for your budget, an amount, and fill in your account info from Capital One. \nPebble pouch is a Pebble watchapp that seamlessly integrates with Android and iOS. It's best used on the Pebble Time, with a beautiful color-alerting background. It clearly presents how much money you have left to spend in your budget, along with how many days/hours you have to spend it in. At the bottom, there's a progress bar that will show you how close you are to spending all your budget. And as you get closer to the top of your budget, the background changes from green to yellow to red. </p>\n<p>Need to know how much is in all of your account? That's displayed, too!</p>\n<p>Want to know where all your money has gone? See your previous bills by clicking the middle button in the app. </p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>We ran into some challenges with memory issues in C while developing for Pebble. But after some review, we made it through. It was also difficult to write the \"Settings\" page, which required a backend server set up to communicate with the Javascript in the Pebble app. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>We are especially proud of how easy the app is to use. We worked hard on arranging the text layers and choosing intuitive colors. We're running a local server using Node.js so that users can enter custom settings.

Our goal is to merge social media and data tracking by launching a wandering weather balloon into the atmosphere and allowing followers to interact with it in meaningful ways as it drifts along. Carried by the Earth's wind currents, there is an element of unpredictability that creates an interest for following the balloon's progress.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Using a 5-ft diameter weather balloon and a simple android-capable smartphone, we are able to capture pictures from the phone's camera, all while interacting with our Social Media Server. The Server, receiving regular updates from the balloon, acts as a mediator between the drifting balloon and the social media it is connected to. So far, it is capable of tweeting a picture along with its location and, at weekly intervals, it sends a newsletter update to its subscribers with pictures and a drawn path on a map of its total travel.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Amelia Earbot</h2>\n<p>Given the adaptable nature of a smartphone, this project has the opportunity to grow its connected APIs and apps. Features such as weather, disaster alerting, mass notification and further GPS sophistication allows the project to become a scalable project to suit the needs of whoever using it. \nThe Amelia Earbot has great potential in assisting in humanitarian causes, such as surveying disaster-stricken areas, reaching isolated locations and serving as a communication hub  for other environmental data-gathering applications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sendgrid\">sendgrid</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">helium</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">weather-balloon</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">the-planet</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.allupinyour.space\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.allupinyour.space\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.allupinyour.space</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/faridasabry2/ameliaearbot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/faridasabry2/ameliaearbot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kiastu/htp2015-server\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kiastu/htp2015-server\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kiastu/htp2015-android\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kiastu/htp2015-android\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Frizzle", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>People waste too much time on sites they go too only because they are idle or bored.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>When you visit sites that you usually waste time on, Frizzle suggests alternate sites to visit.

Once the user initiates the MYO, PA:CP will start with a tutorial on how to use the app. The tutorial will consist of telling the user how to calibrate the MYO and how the user should move their arms. After the tutorial, it will start with level 1. Level 1 will start with elementary movements such moving arm up, sideways, and vertically. If the user has successfully finished all the requirements, the user will be able to move on to the next level. As the level progress further, the movement instructions to the user will be more and more advanced which will be indicating the user\u2019s arm\u2019s motor functions are improving due to the user being able to successfully.\nAdditional features?</p>\n<p>Windows 10 Application\nDoctor\u2019s note: If the user wishes to, the app will have an option to automatically send data resulted from using the app to their primary doctor who specializes in CP. This will be done using Sendgrid.</p>\n<p>Alert for Assistance: The user will have to have some sort of activity every minute. If not, a parent, guardian, or the assistant of the user will receive a text message indicating that there was no activity by the user and that they need help. This will be done using Twilio.</p>\n<p>Oculus Rift Compatibility: Sometimes, users will want to do this alone but still want someone watching over them. Connected to the computer that the app is open in, will be a camera with 360 degrees rotational compatibility. Using this, the user who is watching over the CP patient will be able to see him/her using an Oculus Rift.</p>\n<p>Web App\nClinic Information: User will be able to see the list of doctors in the area of her choice and be able to choose which one they want to go to. The location longitude and latitude coordinates will be done using Bing\u2019s Map api. The coordinates will then be inputted into yelp\u2019s api to pull up the hospital information.</p>\n<p>Donation box: The web app will be able to see a list of people diagnosed with CP who needs financial aid. The user will have the option to donate to either a certain person who whole in general. This will be done using Venmo or Paypal.</p>\n<p>VR Monitor/Therapy</p>\n<p>Monitor: If the user of the Windows 10 App wishes to be alone while using the app, one can use the VR monitor to be able to see whatever is going on.</p>\n<p>Therapy: Sometimes, people diagnosed with Cerebral palsy look down intuitively and thus lose good posture. By inverting the camera rotating positions of the y axis, the user is able to do therapy on it.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-maps\">bing-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/box\">box</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cereal</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://projectasclepius.azurewebsites.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://projectasclepius.azurewebsites.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>projectasclepius.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["React", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"React \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/364/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>An immersive wearable gaming system which uses your body as an input to play 'Street Fighter'.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xbee</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">fsr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">openbci</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://reactwearables.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://reactwearables.xyz/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>reactwearables.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Communication Design @Indus Valley School of Art & Architecture.

On our landing page simply sign up with your name, email, phone number, and team name, and you will volunteer to help out your team and/or the general development community with various challenges they may encounter. Our API allows one to simply wrap any bit of JavaScript code in a function which will handle and all exceptions and reach out to the team and developer community by utilizing Sendgrid and Twilio APIs. If that wasn't enough already, our API invites all recipients to a private collab room online where they can view the code in question, the error or exception, and write comments/give continuous feedback. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Overall the application was a large undertaking for just the two of us.

In fact, we were going to work in the IoT space. But we ran into issues from the very start and we're very grateful for the mentors who are constantly walking around, where we could wave them down in an instant. From this point, we shifted gears. We wanted something online that was as accessible as having mentors walking around and allowing users to wave them down in an instant. Thus, we created CodeConnect, which is an online gateway for coders to connect and mentor one another in exchange for bitcoin!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>CodeConnect uses Twilio video as a webrtc client to connect client with mentor for one-on-one video conferencing, to give people that personal feel and better allow them to solve their bugs. It also uses Twilio's messaging service as a notification system. Additionally, CodeConnect makes use of a collaborative code editor so that both client and mentor can share and fix their code. The app itself is a standalone node.js app that uses mongodb as its database and uses the Blockchain API for its bitcoin payment system.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Blockchain's API was difficult to implement but we were eventually able to authenticate our payment system. Additionally, because Twilio video is currently in a closed beta, the configuration for our peer-to-peer communication network was difficult to set up.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CodeConnect</h2>\n<p>We would like to implement more features to aid in collaboration, such as potentially a code collaboration client that can be immediately embedded into sublime text. We really would just love to see code mentors and code help to be more accessible, in the same way one can stack overflow their bugs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/less\">less</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webrtc\">webrtc</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://codeconnect.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://codeconnect.xyz\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>codeconnect.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Activist5000 - GameChangers", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Activist5000 - GameChangers \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/835/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Activist5000 - GameChangers \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/836/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Activist5000 - GameChangers \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/837/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Activist5000 - GameChangers \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/838/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Activist5000 - GameChangers \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/839/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Activist5000 - GameChangers \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/841/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I am very passionate about using code to change the world, and one cool way to encourage other people to become aware of changing the world and work towards activism is to create games where they learn and fight for causes.

The game is set in year 5000 (Hack The Planet themed), where everything is advanced and no one in developed countries care are about issues that our society cares about today, such as Poverty, Women in STEM, LGBTQ etc. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>You are an activist, in this game you are me :), and the cause for this level is Women in STEM. You will be approached and attacked by aliens, and in order to defeat them you actually educate them about facts relating to women in Computer Science. As a result, in this demo, you will \"hit them with the knowledge\" of Grace Hopper. You also have to avoid the confidence removers that the aliens shoot at you. The goal is that the more aliens you educate, when they dissapear they actually join your activism team and help you educate more aliens about issues in the \"galaxy\".</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I am new to game development, so Unity was a HUGE jump for me. Also, I got REALLY sick on the way to this hackathon, and have been battling minor fevers and cold symptoms, but I was able keep a straight mind and goal set of what I wanted to create. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud that I was able to learn unity and C# in such a short period of time, and also manage to get working code despite my illness.

I was able to cover over 130 pages of the 500-page book starting from scratch. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The basic structure is pretty simple. I generated a rails app using the rails new command. I used scaffolding to create a model for users that includes id (integer), name (string) and email (string). Likewise, I used scaffolding to create a model for microposts that included id (integer), content (text), and user_id (integer). Each microposts has a single user_id which connects it to a specific user. Meanwhile, a user can have as many microposts associated with it as possible. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I would have been able to cover more too if I didn't have problems with setting up Rails on my mac because I upgraded to El Capitan. I had to back up my data and downgrade to Yosemite and reinstall Rails. After 2 complete factory resets, I was able to get Rails and Ruby set up on my computer by 2pm on Saturday.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I've known some basic front-end for a long time but have been really meaning to sit down and dedicate myself to learning a programming language. I've taken programming classes but this is the first time where I'm actually building something from scratch. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The model-view-controller structure is pretty intuitive and I like that rails comes packaged with so many elements so I can get working immediately. I hope I come to understand all of these elements really in-depth over time. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Sample Rails App</h2>\n<p>I am going to finish the rest of the book over the next week and then start working on a project I've had in mind for a while. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://faique-toy-app.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://faique-toy-app.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>faique-toy-app.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Cut", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Cut \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/704/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>None of the team had ever developed for virtual reality, so we decided that it would be fun to use hardware to try something totally new.

One team finishes, and the next team has to scramble to get their laptop plugged in. Maybe they don't have the right port, or maybe they can't find the dongle. You're looking at a few minutes of dead time in between each and every presentation. The guy next to you is going, \"lol, hackathons.\" That ain't right. There are a couple ways to fix this issue: you can drop tens of thousands of dollars on fancy hardware, or, use dope free software. We made dope free software. It's called <em>diamond</em>.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Multiple users can stream concurrently to a host computer, entering their project title and tagline. While one user is presenting, the rest are On Deck. For organizers, switching between live demos is as easy as \u2318-tabbing. No wires, no dongles, no dead time \u2014 less stress all around. All demos are ~automagically~ recorded, titled, and intelligently clipped at transitions from one demo to another (for later uploading). </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>This is a totally cross-platform, wireless solution. There are no plugins or restarts needed, <em>It Just Works\u2122</em>.\nIt looks pretty darn good for 36 hours.</p>\n<h2>Where to?</h2>\n<p>Given a bit more time, we'd like to polish this to the point where any hackathon organizer could feel comfortable using <em>diamond</em> for their presentation flow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/webrtc\">webrtc</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Built the thing", ""]], ["BitSplit", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/624/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/625/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/626/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/627/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/628/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/629/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/630/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/631/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 9\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/639/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 10\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/640/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 11\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/641/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 12\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/642/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BitSplit \u2013 screenshot 13\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/643/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Very often do we shop online and then take care about splitting up bills in one medium and settling up through another. \nCome BitSplit and all your splitting/settling up needs are taken care of. \nPayment through card, paypal and even bitcoins are taken care of. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We tackle the issue, buy splitting up the bill amount before an order is placed.

Even with following all the rules when riding a motorcycle the rider is still at risk of being involved in an accident even if they are not at fault. Usually that is caused by drivers who were not able to spot the rider and end up hitting them.</p>\n<p>Our idea came from looking at youtube videos involving motorcycle riders being hit from the back and also being put into this situation in real life pretty often because the other vehicle driver was too fast or did not see them in time. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We used opensource Computer vision libraries OpenCV and built the system on an android device since being mobile friendly was the goal as well as feasibility. The app spots vehicles behind the motorcycle rider and calculates the speed of the vehicle coming behind them while the rider is at a full stop. If the vehicle behind the rider is too fast and the stopping distance is greater during which the rider is at the risk of being hit, using the pebble watch we alert the user to get out of the way since being on a motorcycle gives the rider a lot more flexibility. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>For this project we could've used a radar gun to find the speed of the vehicle behind the rider but the goal was to make it mobile friendly and gives the riders the confidence by giving them control of the situation they might go through. Doing computer vising on mobile platform is also another challenge since mobile devices dont have enough computing power.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Calculating speed of an object using computer vision was the hardest challenge for this project as the speed was not always accurate. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a few new things about computer vision, Object detecting algorithms and how accuracy is affected, also had a basic refresh of basic physics for calculating velocity of an object.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Beyekster</h2>\n<p>Our goals for Beyekster are: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make it more accurate when it comes to calculating speed of an object in the camera. </li>\n<li>Use better algorithms to spot vehicles as well as identify them so we can check the weight of the vehicle with a database and have more accurate stopping distance. </li>\n<li>Add new features such as automatic emergency request in case the rider was hit and got hurt. </li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kalman-algorithm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">haar-cascade-algorithm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bmw-motorcycle</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xxwikkixx/Beyekster\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/xxwikkixx/Beyekster\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Did the back end for android app, OpenCV object detection, algorithmic speed calculation", ""]], ["nerve", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>nerve. is a non profit tech start up that targets individuals such as yourself in the hopes that you want to help make a difference in your community.

But Termulus is not your typical puzzler, where you might control your robot with up and down keys. Instead, you program the robot and the world with blocks.</p>\n<h2>Gameplay</h2>\n<p>Each level consists of two phases - a programming phase, where the user connects a limited number of blocks together to provide instructions to their robot; and a run phase, where the instructions are carried out. While running their programs, robots interact with various level elements, such as buttons, doors, and pushers. The programmable nature of the game works very well here; for example, players may program buttons to open doors or cause their robot to take additional actions.</p>\n<h2>Development Challenges</h2>\n<p>The logic behind Termulus is neatly divided into two portions: logic surrounding the game board (such as how robots move, how doors push robots, etc); and the block code interpreter. A block program is similar to a common compiler construct, formally an Abstract Syntax Tree. However, when interpreting an AST, one usually uses recursion and executes the tree as fast as possible. In our case, however, we wished to execute steps of the tree at a regular interval, have animations play between steps, run multiple trees simultaneously, etc. This meant our tree execution was considerably more complicated than a typical AST, and development of that took up about half my time at Hack the Planet.\n ## Awesomeness\nTermulus has some amazing features. In addition to an entire interpreter built from scratch (see above), we have a robust block editor and a great number of game elements. A user might program their robot to drive over a button, which they programmed to open a door, then cause their robot to conditionally turn when it sees red paint on the floor, to get to the end of a level. In another case, one robot may be driving toward a cliff, while another robot steps on a button to activate a device for pushing them out of the way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/IanPudney/Terminus\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/IanPudney/Terminus\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on full-stack.

We decided that using incentives for prizes as monetary rewards would be effective motivators in encouraging charity. With this in mind, we built an automated, live bitcoin lottery service integrated in a web application.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Royale is a web-based bitcoin lottery that directly supports charity. Users simply visit the Royale site, and using their existing bitcoin wallets, enter lottery pools reflecting their desired risk. Once all the entrants for a particular pool have submitted their funds, Royale selects a winner through a 100% random process. Of the $100 worth of bitcoin collected for each lottery, $50 dollars worth goes directly to Doctors Without Borders. The winning players of the lotteries also have the opportunity to donate their share of the winnings to this charity.  From a technical perspective, the site is an node server that interacts with the Blockchain wallet API. They facilitate the transactions and we display any updates to the pools live by holding our data in Firebase. Once a pool is filled, half of its total value is donated to charity, and the lucky winning user has the option to keep or donate their half of the winnings.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Building this web application entirely from scratch, we encountered a number of problems along the way to completion. One the biggest challenges involved getting our live-updating, a critical feature of Royale's bitcoin lotteries, to actually update live.

We wanted to learn how to use React along with Flux in the client side so we thought we would build one of the most retro video games!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>React's one-way data-binding and virtual DOM makes re-renders very smooth, so we used it along with Flux to write all of our game logic. On the server side, we use Node.js websockets to hold open connections with each client. When an action occurs at one client, it passes along this event through a websocket to the server, which then broadcasts this change to all other clients, allowing them to change state as necessary.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We were both fairly new to React and very new to Flux (neither of us used it before), so it took a while for us to go through some tutorials/readings to understand the infrastructure of how to set up our game.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We learned one of the most exciting and upcoming front-end frameworks and built a game (an exciting challenge that is very different to regular web development)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Both of us learned a lot about React, Flux and using sockets with React. We also learned that we should plan out our code architecture before starting to hack (haha)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Snake</h2>\n<p>There are still several rough edges (like any hackathon project) so we'd love to clean those up and host it for our friends to play.

Two players alternate turns. Each player's army occupies a four-by-three grid and consists of soldiers with three types of weapons: swords, axes, and lances. On their first turn, the players fill their girds with soldiers. Players initially cannot see what weapons their opponents' soldiers have. On each turn, players do one of the following: reveal the weapon of a unit in their opponent's front row, switch the places of two of their soldiers, call in a new soldier with a weapon of their choice at the back of their army, or order one of the units in their army's front row to attack the corresponding unit in their opponent's front row. Combat is resolved according to a weapons triangle: swords beat axes, axes beat lances, and lances beat swords. If two units with the same weapon fight, both are eliminated. Whichever player completely clears out a column of their opponent's army first wins the game. If a column on both sides is cleared simultaneously, the game is a draw. Players have 20 soldiers of each weapon type to deploy over the course of a game. </p>\n<h2>Design goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Limited information:</strong> you must find out how your opponent's units are arranged and make inferences about units that have not been revealed in order to counter effectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Maintain a mixed-strategy equilibrium:</strong> the weapons triangle ensures that for every strategy there is always an effective counter and rewards players for balancing their army's composition. </li>\n<li><strong>Emergent strategy:</strong> an elegant rule set leads to a dance of attacks, counters, deceptions, and bluffs. </li>\n<li><strong>Casual gamer appeal:</strong> with simple mechanics, brief turns, and a straightforward game concept, \"You Shall Not Pass!\" can bring the essence of great strategy gaming to a casual audience. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Next steps</h2>\n<p>Since the current prototype only allows for hotseat games on Windows, Mac, and Linux, I hope to implement online and local multiplayer for \"You Shall Not Pass!\" using Photon Unity Networking and create a suitable control scheme for an iOS and Android version. Ultimately, I would like to release the game on the Mac, iOS, and Android app stores and post it to Steam Greenlight. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/efldkj907hbhbra/You%20Shall%20Not%20Pass%21.zip?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/efldkj907hbhbra/You%20Shall%20Not%20Pass%21.zip?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Owen Leddy -- All scripts, textures, and sprites in the game are my own work.

This project replaces regular every-day items with 'beautiful' augmented scenes of Curiosity, the latest Mars rover launched in 2011, on any flat surface. A heads up display showing the rover's data like temperature and air pressure is shown to provide interesting information to the rover's observers.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We created a homemade robot that acts as one of the objects that is tracked in the virtual environment. The robot is powered by an Arduino that we programmed to allow 4-directional movement, and is controlled via communication between a bluetooth module and Android device. This robot transforms into the Mars Curiousity Rover, when viewed through the VR headset.</p>\n<p>Using computer vision, we were able to detect and track objects that had certain, distinct, patterns. The textures covering the rover and the ground are optimized for recognition with the edge detection that occurs in the computer vision. Once the object is found, a 3-D model is generated in the physical objects space, and since the vision algorithm continuously tracks the physical object's movement, we get the accurate motion of the rover on Mars.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr\">oculus-gear-vr</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li><li></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">embedded-systems</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">robotics</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on the hardware's software, and the baseline computer vision functionality", "I worked on the hardware, wiring the components (motors, bluetooth module, power supply) to the breadboard and Arduino.

The Google Ideas team indirectly showed us that, over the last decade, certain basic human rights have become strongly tied to technology and how much access we all have to it. We figured that whatever we built at Hack the Planet would follow in Google's footsteps and provide a basic human right to an oppressed group of people, the people living in ISIS-controlled territories.</p>\n<p>Reporters and civilians (insiders) living in ISIS-controlled territories have had their freedom of speech massively cut off by ISIS. These insiders are struggling to safely communicate with the outside world (outsiders). Furthermore, insiders are subject to random search and seizure by ISIS officials. They confiscate their phones and laptops and thoroughly search them, interrogating any passwords/pins out of the owner. If they find anything \"incriminating\" then ISIS arrests the owner and potentially tortures and/or beheads them. </p>\n<p>Fuck ISIS, we came to Hack the Planet to give the insiders their freedom back.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Reach is a secure communication platform that works for both desktop and mobile. Insiders download an app that, to the unsuspecting eye, is just a calculator. However, to the owner of the phone, upon entering a unique code via the calculator interface, the calculator view dismisses to show Reach's chat application! From here, an insider can initiate a chat with an outsider over an SSL-encrypted connection. Every message sent by the insider is deleted after a fixed period of time to ensure no \"incriminating\" information is left lying around. Outsiders can then reply via the web platform and they retain all of the messages safely on their computer. Outsiders can never initiate conversations so there's little-to-no risk of a member of ISIS signing up for the platform to identify any insiders. As a final precaution, each user is identified and represented by a 128-character alphanumeric code rather than their name. Only the people within the chat can see this code.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>With each added feature, we had to ensure that our platform wouldn't endanger insiders. We had to change up our model a bit to fit what was technically possible with what was logically safe. Many of us weren't as experienced with some of the tools we were using so, naturally, we faced technical challenges throughout the whole process.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We have built something that provides a safer alternative to the existing communication methods for people in ISIS-controlled territories. This may very well save at least one life during one of ISIS' spontaneous searches and we deployed the app to Syrian users this weekend!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our team was pretty inexperienced in regard to a lot of technologies we used so we ended up learning a lot about various tools. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Reach (counter-ISIS communication)</h2>\n<p>We will be sending the app to the Google Ideas team so they can try to break it and suggest technical improvements. There are many more oppressed people beyond the middle east and we hope to extend the product to fit the needs of anyone who wants to safely communicate with the outside world!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">crosswalk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/travis-ci\">travis-ci</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cloudflare\">cloudflare</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://projectreach.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://projectreach.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>projectreach.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built the API, the template for the outsider interface front-end, worked on the React system for the front-end, and set up a Travis-driven devops toolchain.", "", "", "", ""]], ["Hotspot 2.0 Profile distribution with SendGrid", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: This project was inspired from an existing project I am working on for iOS profile distribution.</h2>\n<h2>How it works: The webpage takes in user information to give them a customized wifi profile to download.

As the world becomes a truly integrated global economy, more firms, both large and small, are shifting toward international trade.</p>\n<p>The Foreign Exchange Market (Forex Market) is the biggest and most liquid financial market in the world. According to the Bank for International Settlements, the preliminary global results from the 2013 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives Markets Activity showed that trading in foreign exchange markets averaged $5.3 trillion dollars per day in April 2013.</p>\n<p>Companies engaged in international trade and investment use the Forex Market to convert the the payments they receive for their exports, the income it receives from foreign investments and the income from licensing agreements with foreign firms in foreign currencies.  </p>\n<p>The Forex Market is divided into levels of access. The levels of access are determined by the size of the \"line\" (the amount of money with which participants are trading). Thus, historically only large financial institutions, corporations, central banks, hedge funds and extremely wealthy individuals had the resources to participate and take full advantage of  the market. </p>\n<p>For businesses involved in international trade, trading globally gives consumers and countries the opportunity to be exposed to new markets and products. As companies engage in cross-border trade and investment, they need to recognize and understand currency fluctuation because what happens in the foreign exchange market can have a fundamental impact on their sales, profits and strategies.</p>\n<p>Conducting business transactions across national borders requires understanding of two simple rules: Be innovative or be cheaper than the competition.  </p>\n<p>LemontreeFX is a Mexican company providing international payments and peer-to-peer foreign exchange services to corporate customers involved in international trade.

Facebook users, we are in chat groups that rapidly gain 200+ new messages between us reading them. We wanted to read the interesting conversations, and skip the others. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Sum Chat scrapes the chat history of a specified group chat you are in. From the posts it hasn't read yet, SumChat accumulates all of the word frequencies. Then, it posts the highest words in the group chat for everyone to see. </p>\n<p>It is able to summarize in two modes: periodic and on demand. The periodic mode summarizes the past x posts in the chat. The on demand mode summarizes the last 500 words from the chat log. </p>\n<p>It also has shoutout integration. It reads other members mentions with the @ symbol, and tags the target user in the same group.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Facebook Messenger API deprecated, phantomjs, parsing the Facebook DOM, learning about how to scrape, learning node.js, .</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our hack is able to read, write, and time responses appropriately in a Facebook chat. Additionally, we reached our goals we set for our hack this weekend. There are a lot of features to add on, but this is a MVP we are proud of.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Megan: This was the first scraping project I have ever done. Because of that, I learned about how to determine where the interesting information is. I first tried to do this project in phantomjs =&gt; nightmarejs. That was the first time I worked on node.js and it was a good experience. But, when I found a good python Facebook sign-on solution through phantomjs, the ball really started to roll and I didn't look back. Through python, something I was familiar with, I was able to get into the depths of figuring out how to parse the DOM. </p>\n<p>Hallie: I learned that you can post through a headless browser, despite the fact that Facebook's messaging API is deprecated. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SumChat</h2>\n<p>This bot can now be used to automate anyone's chat experience. This has much more potential than keeping this as just a chat summarizer. Some use cases We have brainstormed so far:\nUse the @replies to automatically start a private conversation with someone from the group. \nAutomatically send a message to new members of a group you admin to welcome them, and moderating them. This could include sending a link to a reported post with a message about why it isn't appropriate. </p>\n<p>The possibilities are endless for being able to receive information in a condensed way, and distribute it in a scaleable but personalized manner.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/selenium\">selenium</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phantomjs\">phantomjs</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["v9", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>JavaScript interpreter written in Go and self-proclaimed successor to Google's v8.</p>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://fabfb66a.ngrok.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://fabfb66a.ngrok.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>fabfb66a.ngrok.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joshwget/v9\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joshwget/v9\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["CollegeSmarter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CollegeSmarter \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/407/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CollegeSmarter \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/412/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>README</p>\n<p>CollegeSmarter is a data-aggregation web application that takes data from the web and users to give a picture of the value of individual schools' educations in the United States</p>\n<p>The main factor this application takes into account is the financial cost and benefit of attending university.

Sighing, you look in your wallet, but as usual you only find cards and receipts.  You don't want to lose your spot, but the only ATM at the bar charges ridiculous service fees.  Ugh.</p>\n<p>With Cash Only, this is no longer a problem.  You simply pull up the app, request the cash you need, and you'll be matched with a nearby member of the Cash Only peer-to-peer network.  You send them the $5 plus a small thank-you bonus on Venmo, they hand over the cash, and dreading the phrase \"cash only\" becomes a thing of the past.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Cash Only is a mobile web app built on the Ruby on Rails framework.  It utilizes the Venmo API for person-to-person payments and Parse for its backend data.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We spent that majority of this hackathon attempting to learn how to use PhoneGap.  PhoneGap allows developers to write apps in HTML and JavaScript, then it compiles into Android, iOS, and other native applications.  We thought that PhoneGap would be the perfect solution for creating an app that used HTTP APIs like a web app, while at the same time tracking user location in the background like a native app.  Unfortunately, while PhoneGap is a web app internally, it is not actually designed for use with HTTP APIs like Venmo.  We found several hacky implementations of HTTP APIs online, but none of them would work on our machines.  Therefore after approximately 24 of the 36 hackathon hours we switched to making a Ruby on Rails app so the Venmo API could be used properly.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cash Only</h2>\n<p>We see Cash Only becoming a platform like Lyft or AirBNB, where individuals can disrupt corporate monopolies and everyone gains convenience.

This number alone was enough to inspire us in order to work towards this solution. \nAs amazing an experience motorbikes provide, no one can deny that they are indeed not safe enough, so we have built a solution to make them safer, and more reliable.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>RideAway helps bikers share routes with friends, or discover other bikers in their location. This feature lets riders share their passion with others, while never having to ride alone. \nThe other very important aspect of RideAway is to keep the riders safe, by checking how alert they are while driving. This is done through a novel way of tracking the driver's eye movement and body motion. Riders can even even set up automated calls to emergency contacts in case they are in danger.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some issues at dealing with maps in iOS along with some problems with getting hardware for our project. We had to check out three different hardware stores in Santa Clara, CA just to get the hardware that we needed. Integrating the hardware was another story.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Facial Recognition</li>\n<li>Motion Sensor Detection</li>\n<li>Sharing Location Halfway Meetup Point (ETA)</li>\n<li>Making some awesome new friends</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for RideAway</h2>\n<p>We plan on fine-tuning the app to make it more stable and reliable for the drivers who intend to use it. We would like to tap into existing technologies to make the system more robust. We also hope to connect with people who are interested in motorcycling and would be more than delighted to hear their stories.</p>\n<h2>The Team</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://devpost.com/aubakirova\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malika Aubakirova</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devpost.com/majaco\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matt Jacobs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devpost.com/josephmilla\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joseph Milla</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devpost.com/rumaiisa\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rumaisa Mughal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://devpost.com/bngadimi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bryan Ngadimin</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/picmonkey\">picmonkey</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/particle\">particle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bmw</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://youbetternotfallfromyourbike.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://youbetternotfallfromyourbike.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>youbetternotfallfromyourbike.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Scenic View", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKniM-7KKas?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Initially we saw the BMW challenge to produce an app that would make drivers want to drive the BMW Motorcycle. We couldn't think of many things, but quickly realized that to do so, we had to provide drivers with an experience that would be more enjoyable on the motorcycle than anything else. The amount of exposure to the road's environment a driver has on a motorcycle is more than that of a car, so we decided that drivers of a motorcycle would likely enjoy beautiful scenery to a greater degree. With that, we decided to produce an app which would maximize their capability to do so while still allowing them to go to where they wanted to be.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Our app enables users to query their own location (or manually enter one) and provide a destination. It then looks for scenic places in the area such as parks within the radius of the origin to destination and the user may map any of the located scenic points as one of the midpoints of his/her route. The application then generates a URL value which users may share with their friends or directly open with a compatible mobile app like Google Maps or Chrome.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Various technical challenges were encountered in this project: early on, we had to decide on an API to use to find \nMoreover, when we decided on Google Maps, parts of the API for Google Maps for route production were not well documented. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of our seamless mapping and user experience as well as our app's ability to provide links that Android can detect are meant to be opened with Google Maps. We also provide a smooth Address Autocomplete for both the origin and destination of the route powered by Google, which we are very excited to present.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Over the course of this project, we learned many things concerning Google Maps API as well as various subtleties concerning projects utilizing Google Maps Locations Autocomplete.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Scenic View</h2>\n<p>Our goals for the future are to expand this project to enable users to more easily share their routes with their friends and allow people to enjoy more deeply places that may not be well documented in Google Maps, but documented by other APIs. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked with the Google Maps API to help generate the search results based on the origin and destination of the user's input.

Contextual, just-in-time information can now be presented in ways that allow for the augmentation of our daily lives. While navigation was reliant on maps and intuition in the past, a rider can now wander in an arbitrary direction without fear of being stranded thanks to breakthroughs in small, wearable computing devices. Users are more connected than ever, but we're still not quite there.\nWe believe that a solution is here. There could be a way to seamlessly bring bikers of all experience levels together.</p>\n<p>We have made an ecosystem for motorcyclists, both young and old, designed to bring them together in ways previously unimagined. We have connected wearable devices, such as the Pebble Watch to integrate notifications for riders that may be in a position to get rained on. A few minutes of warning could mean the difference between a safe and unsafe trip. There are features to bring riders together and compete for the most distance traveled over a period of time.</p>\n<p>There were issues with VR reliability across multiple machines, but we were still able to overcome augmenting the rider's experience with other wearables.</p>\n<p>There was an incredible amount accomplished in a very short time; much more than at a typical hackathon between all participants, not just with the RideFlow team members.</p>\n<p>I learned an incredible amount, not just from the successes, but from the challenges, as well. Team members learned things ranging from how to quickly spin up a Heroku app to creating a compelling, real-time VR experience.</p>\n<p>The potential for a reliable community filled with active motorcyclists is here and we were lucky enough to play a part.

It makes it so that if the client needs to update a calendar / add events to their website, they can simply update it on their Google Calendar and the change will be automatically reflected on the website. </p>\n<p>This allows developers to link ANY public Google Calendar to their website and grab its contents with a single jQuery request. To get the library setup, the user must include jQuery and the <code>google-calendar-events.js</code> file, then define these variables in the header:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>var mykey = '&lt;your-google-api-key&gt;'; \nvar calendarid = '&lt;public-google-calendar-id&gt;'; \nvar maxEvents = 10; // optional\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, they are ready to use any of the below jQuery calls to fetch data from their calendar.</p>\n<h2>jQuery Calls</h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that all of the returned events are ordered by their start time - so the one starting closest to the current time is returned first (at index 0), etc. Also, this doesn't return events that happen on the day the request is made.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is how you use the plugin:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>General Structure</h3>\n<p><code>$.grabCalendar(type, date_formatted)</code></p>\n<h3>Parameters</h3>\n<p><code>type</code> - <strong>(optional)</strong> This a <strong>string</strong> that can be either \"events\" or \"detailedEvents\". \"events\" will return a concise response that will be what most developers will be looking for (start, end, location, summary, description). \"detailedEvents\" will return a raw (&amp; verbose) response containing a greater number of more fields. If this parameter is excluded completely, the response will give extended information for the Google Calendar including the events and general information about the calendar (timezone, name of calendar, description, etc.)</p>\n<p><code>date_formatted</code> - <strong>(optional)</strong> This is a <strong>boolean</strong> value that gives the date in a more friendly format if set to <code>true</code>. For example, <code>2015-08-17T06:30:00-04:00</code> would become <code>Monday August 17, 2015 - 6:30 AM</code>. If this is set to <code>false</code> or is excluded, the date will come in the standard ISO-8601 format (<code>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD</code>). This parameter can also be used even if no <code>type</code> is included in the call.</p>\n<h2>Example Calls</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are all of the supported &amp; valid calls:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>$.grabcalendar();\n$.grabcalendar(\"events\");\n$.grabcalendar(\"detailedEvents\");\n$.grabcalendar(true);\n$.grabcalendar(\"events\", true);\n$.grabcalendar(\"detailedEvents\", true);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Personally, I believe the <code>$.grabcalendar(\"events\", true)</code> will be the most practical &amp; useful for web developers. The <code>index.html</code> file has an example web page that includes everything you need (except your unique information) to run the jquery plugin.</p>\n<h2>Response Format</h2>\n<p>All of the requests return a JSON response. Here is an example response from calling <code>$.grabcalendar(\"events\", true)</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>[\n    {\n        \"start\": \"Sunday August 16, 2015 - 8:00 AM\",\n        \"end\": \"Sunday August 16, 2015 - 3:00 PM\",\n        \"summary\": \"All Time Low ft.

Our rides get better and faster, yet roads deteriorate and we still have a complicated relationship with fellow motorists. What we need is someone watching our backs, making sure we receive help if we need it, while also helping us to improve our rides. We need a Copilot.</p>\n<p>Copilot is your silent partner whenever you ride. A \"set it and forget it\" solution, upon first launch, Copilot will ask its driver to designate a contact to be alerted in case of emergency, in addition to a few personalization options. Once configured, Copilot will act as your guardian angel, monitoring your ride in the background. Upon detection of a crash, Copilot will alert the contact designated by the driver as well as the proper authorities. Copilot can even automatically launch itself whenever the driver's device is turned on, allowing for a potentially life saving safety net even if the driver forgets to launch the app before their ride.</p>\n<p>Copilot will also help you refine and analyze your ride style. Copilot will take a GPS snapshot whenever it detects rapid acceleration or deceleration, or whenever you achieve a new top speed. When paired with an Android Wear device, Copilot will also take a snapshot whenever it detects a sudden spike in its driver's heart-rate. You'll receive a complete map of every snapshot taken along your ride, allowing you to check your speed profile throughout the ride and check where your heart may have been telling you to work on your control.</p>\n<p>With a designated Copilot by your side, you'll finally be able to ride with confidence.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">play-services</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-apps</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-wear\">android-wear</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Calling Space", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n<p>Haven't you always wanted to call space?

We then use these relationship strengths to see healthiest relationships between friend circles, strongest/weakest chains in a network, and deploy dijkstra's algorithm to plot out the most efficient chain of connections to introduce person A to person B.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>AWS EC2 instance ran out of memory (160k+ machine learning training datasets)</li>\n<li>Pairing laptops/phones with Muse Headbands</li>\n<li>Syntax &amp; Semantic Errors</li>\n<li>Front-end IE8 compatibility (not accomplished - too hard)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Successfully pairing laptop with Muse Headband</li>\n<li>Successful hosting to AWS and Microsoft Azure with minimal issues</li>\n<li>Working with strangers on a project we all share interest in. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Development on Muse hardware and its future potential</li>\n<li>The arts of machine learning and its impact towards technology today</li>\n<li>Debugging skills (too many bugs - all exterminated \u263a)</li>\n<li>Team bonding and management skills</li>\n<li>Core concepts of emerging technologies (<i>hello</i> Node.js &amp; Angular.js)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/predictionio\">predictionio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sendgrid\">sendgrid</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muse-headband</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Nest in the Bahamas", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Nest in the Bahamas \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/281/300/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>So you just booked a vacation and are super stoked about relaxing for a couple of weeks on your trip. You are busy packing and planning for your weekend; maybe you're getting your kids and their belongings corralled. The last thing you need is the worry of forgetting something important-- perhaps something that could cost you a lot of money by the time your vacation is over. What if there was a way for your Nest thermostat to automatically know when you are leaving for vacation?</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We have created an algorithm that will be able to determine when you are leaving out of town by utilizing the Gmail API and extracting your flight information automatically. Once we determine the dates that you are gone for, we command our Nest thermostat to execute the best money-saving action depending on your region for while you're gone. We have integrated a weather API that will determine the surrounding temperature and determine if turning off the HVAC system or setting the temperature to a minimum/maximum value is the most optimal solution to save costs.</p>\n<p>For instance, in colder areas, we wouldn't want the HVAC system to completely turn off but instead maintain the lowest temperature so that the water pipes don't freeze while you're gone. Also, right before you return home, it automatically turns the thermostat back to normal so you can come back to comfort. We have also integrated a cost saving calculator to the main Nest Home UI that will show how much you have saved!</p>\n<p>Finally, for additional peace of mind, we integrated the Twilio API to text you once our algorithm activates so that you can be absolutely sure everything's fine!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The getting started section of the NEST API wasn't the most user friendly. We also had a hard time parsing the emails for flight information.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We have implemented an app not previously featured on the Nest websites best apps. This is a very real use case and we hope will encourage more integration with google services.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Nest Vacation Saver</h2>\n<p>With the release of Google Now, we can use the more user friendly Now Cards to infer flight information and more seamlessly update information across services</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-gmail-oauth\">google-gmail-oauth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nest\">nest</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gmail\">gmail</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Bitcoin Notification System", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Decentralize all the things!

We want riders to not only feel motivated to ride frequently but also navigate the roads with friends, safety, and freedom.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>GoMoto promotes a seamless user interface where riders can actively share and monitor their motorcycling experiences via Android's Moto 360 smart watch, an Android smartphone, and a web site. Once the mobile application is launched on the Android smartphone device, it is mounted to the motorcycle dashboard to take pictures at any given moment. Android's Moto 360, which is worn while riding and integrated with the mobile application, reads the rider's heartbeat at high fluctuating levels. Then on the web site, the pictures, heartbeat, and ride history can easily be viewed and shared with your friends and family to encourage others to go out riding.  Please note a Moto 360 smart watch and Android smartphone are required for GoMoto.</p>\n<h2>Challenges Experienced</h2>\n<p>It was our first time working with machine learning, integration with the Moto 360's heartbeat sensor, Microsoft Azure, Polymer, and several innovative technologies. Through spending many hours with these innovative technologies, we now understand how to utilize them for mobile and web applications.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We Are Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We were able to successfully develop a mobile and web application for the BMW Motorrad challenge while integrating several innovative technologies. </p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We primarily worked with Android/Android Wear, JavaScript, CSS, machine learning, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and several innovative technologies. Some of us were new to working with these technologies, and it was a great getting to learn more about them. Additionally, we learned to work as a team and delegate tasks to successfully create GoMoto.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for GoMoto</h2>\n<p>We plan to continue gathering more data to improve machine learning algorithms so that we can further optimize user experience before, during, and after the ride. Additionally, we would like to integrate live video streaming in the future; however, due to the time constraints we were not able to add these features.

Beautiful weather, empty roads... and nowhere to go. Why can't riding be more than just getting from A to B?</p>\n<h2>The 'Poker Run'</h2>\n<p>Motorcycle clubs across America have adopted so called 'Poker Runs', where local biker groups get together and drive to 5 separate locations during the course of a day, receiving a playing card for each location they visit. At the end of the ride, the best hand wins (just like in real poker!). </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, these are small, regional events that have to be planned well in advance beforehand (and often require participants to pay in). Why can't we take this idea a step further?</p>\n<h2><em>MotoRide</em></h2>\n<p>MotoRide is a weekly contest that encourages riders to go and ride through automatically generated routes in their area. For every location they visit, the user receives a playing card. After 5 locations, the player has a full poker hand, and at the end of the week the best hand receives a $100 gift card from BMW! Users have the ability to join groups in their area to ride with, and all of the navigation functionality is handled by the app itself. </p>\n<p>The routes are generated automatically, so riders can be in any part of the country, and they'll never get tired of riding the same routes twice.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MotoRide</h2>\n<p>With any luck, the community will think it's as good of an idea as we do.

With Pebblecoin, finding market statistics and receiving or sending currency has never been more accessible.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The app first has to be downloaded onto the Pebble Watch. Afterwards, we give the users three options: Statistics about Bitcoin at the moment, Creating Wallets, and Viewing wallets. Wallets are viewed/created/used through Blockchain's API. Apart from those necessary features, we also allow an easy Bitcoin payment system from watch to watch through QR Codes. We built a quick IOS companion app that allows the used to scan any other QR code on a watch, and he/she can directly send Bitcoin to the encoded address. The process works in reverse too, meaning when you want to receive Bitcoin from someone else, you would simply bring up wallet you want to send the money too. Then the app would encode the address into a QR Code, which it displays for other people to take a picture of - it is a seamless, simple integration of two ever-growing, popular entities in technology.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>At first, we had written the entire app on Pebble's Cloud SDK in JavaScript, but soon realized that writing the app in that fashion would not allow us to easily generate QR Codes that would make the use of our app simple. Thus, around halfway through, we scraped everything we were doing and re wrote the whole app in Pebble-C. The real challenge came in using C, because none of of us were greatly familiar with the C language or even had experience coding in C.</p>\n<h2>Milestones</h2>\n<p>Some of the greatest milestones along this weekend were: Deciding on an idea that solved a real problem, Getting our first JS Pebble app working (learning the Pebble interface), getting our IOS companion app done, and solving the many Heap errors we were having while coding in C :).</p>\n<h2>What we learned along the way</h2>\n<p>To speak more technically, all of us have learned a great deal of the C programming language - from heaps to cstrings, most of it was new and, while we adapted to use the language by the end, there is still definitely a lot we could learn and improve on. I also feel our team gained a great deal of knowledge on Bitcoin, and how the world of Bitcoin actually functions. Since we are creating a app for BitCoin, understanding the rudimentary workings of the currency was essential, but each of use eventually attained some level of greater understanding of Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pebblecoin?</h2>\n<p>Pebble Blockchain hopes to launch its app and have Bitcoin users, who have Pebble watches, use our app to connect their Bitcoin and Pebble watcch.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethanlee16/pebble-blockchain\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ethanlee16/pebble-blockchain\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Along with Ethan, I created the app in Pebble C.

He thought he had the route to his school memorized. Unfortunately, he ended up lost on his way home from school. Having no data plan, Rohan was forced to call for his parents and wait for quite a long time before his parents could pick him up at the corner. He wasn't expecting this, since he used wifi everywhere.</p>\n<p>This summer, Sritam and his family traveled to India for quick vacation. Unfortunately, his parents were travelling through the rural areas when they realized that they were lost. Communicating with the locals was quite trying, as most of them did not speak english. Instead, they had to call a couple of their friends to help them out. When they came over to Sritam and his family after quite a few hours, it turned out that they took the wrong turn. </p>\n<p>Rohan and Sritam sought to find a solution to these problems at Hack the Planet.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The user inputs the address of the place he/she would like to visit. (Example: <code>1401 N Shoreline Blvd Mountain View, CA 94043</code>)</p>\n<p>The Android app also generates the latitude and longitude of the user which doesn't require wifi. The app sends over the latitude and longitude and address of destination to the server.</p>\n<p>The server, which runs on AWS, is a flask application that runs on python. It uses Bing API, Google Direction API, and Twilio API to help generate the information and direction that it will send to the server. The server also calculates the Vincenty distance between the two points.</p>\n<p>The server sends a text through twilio to the user with:\n1.Vincenty Distance\n2.The Directions to their Destination - The directions have HTML tags on them. Due to the time constraint of the hackathon, we weren\u2019t able to fix it. But it gives the directions, which was the main purpose of this hack. Anyways, they're mostly just bold tags.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we faced</h2>\n<p>As high school students, we struggled with getting the flask app to connect to Twilio. But we got it working anyways. We also had some problems with AWS, but the mentors were helpful in getting our server deployed on Amazon Beanstalk.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are extremely proud of the fact that our project works and that the user doesn't need wifi or a data plan. We believe that this project could help people in developing countries where people don't spend much money on data or don't have wifi in many places.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot especially twilio API and how to use Amazon web services.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Lost Connection</h2>\n<p>Anytime you go on a trip either outside or inside of the US, with Lost Connection you will arrive at your destination even if you do get lost on the way. The best part is that you don\u2019t need wifi or data, just an SMS plan. (If you don\u2019t have one, it will only charge your account -- which would be way better than getting lost)</p>\n<p>This can hack ride as well. With the assurance that they will not get lost whether they have wifi or not, users will be more tempted to ride farther and hopefully with motorcycles.</p>\n<p>If this project gathers enough support, this will encourage us to build it into a startup.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sms</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing\">bing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-maps\">bing-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-directions\">google-directions</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/squarespace\">squarespace</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/paypal\">paypal</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sritam.app\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sritam.app\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>play.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rohan-aren-edtz.squarespace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://rohan-aren-edtz.squarespace.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>rohan-aren-edtz.squarespace.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PyRIOnpRo_XrZQsu4P2kfscM_pk2oghGutSYOk5yGPY/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PyRIOnpRo_XrZQsu4P2kfscM_pk2oghGutSYOk5yGPY/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hacktheplane-dev.elasticbeanstalk.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hacktheplane-dev.elasticbeanstalk.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hacktheplane-dev.elasticbeanstalk.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://htp-lostconnection.TK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://htp-lostconnection.TK\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>htp-lostconnection.TK</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the backend and android app.", "I worked on some of the backend and learned to integrate APIs.

It can knit and purl, and even be programmable, but it\u2019s not scalable. You can\u2019t increase or decrease the number of stitches in a row, unless you do it manually, like this guy does for the shoulders of his sweater. If someone made a machine that could knit like a human, with just two hooks, and all of the stitches held on a cord, the machine would be able to make as many stitches as the cord was long, and cord could be made arbitrarily long. Plus, one could coerce it to knit twice in the same stitch for an increase in row size, and to hook adjacent stitches together for a decrease.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Knitting is essentially pulling new loops through loops on the previous row. The mechanism has a hook to pick up a loop from the previous row, another hook to pull a new loop through, and a third hook to put down the new loop.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Jordan's suitcase was lost by Air Canada until Saturday night, so for the beginning of the hackathon we were doing everything with wires and duct tape and no tools. We also ran into a snag when we realized that the motor we used for the yarn loader was not a continuous servo. We thought a stepper would be too heavy, so we disassembled a servo to transform it into a continuous servo, but this did not give us the precision we needed. Thankfully Jordan's suitcase was delivered, and we used his dremel to mount a stepper for the yarn loader.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Tony did all our electrical work with only 2 months of electrical experience.

A handwritten signature can be a characteristic, identifying mark; it's difficult to replicate someone else's exact pattern of strokes, speed of handwriting, and variance in pressure applied by a pen or finger. With Sensel's high-precision and highly granular computer input device, SignAuth exploits the characteristic properties of a person's signature by innovately using it as an identifying mechanism for web-based two-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>SignAuth adds this security by requiring a precise, physical signature from the user, in addition to a standard username and password. Its security depends on a configurable-threshold match of speed, path, and pressure, all of which is validated during the two-factor authentication process.</p>\n<p>SignAuth is built on Flask. The backend endpoints query Sensel's Python API, which reads a continuous input pattern from the device. A custom-written error calculation algorithm--which takes into account the path of the stroke, the speed with which it was written, and the pressure applied at various points in the signature--determines whether the input stroke matches the user-defined signature.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sensel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LINKIWI/sign-auth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LINKIWI/sign-auth\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["StreamBridge", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When your friend shares a song with you from one streaming service and you can't use the link because you use a different streaming service.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>StreamBridge is a python library that interfaces with streaming services for the purpose of finding music content, or transferring playlists and libraries between services. Currently we support Google Play Music and Spotify, but our platform is designed to allow other providers to be added easily.
