We think we have.</p>\n<p>The beauty of technology is that crazy things are possible. Technology allows us to transcend our biology and become so called Gods. Doing an ordinary task like driving and making it jaw dropping is what we set out to do. Steering wheels are so last century, what if we could drive a car using our mind. Simple Question. Difficult challenge. </p>\n<p>It was a journey, but we made it. So what did we do technically to achieve this madness. Firstly, we took the steering wheel apart from the car and 3D printed a gear and other components and attached it in place of the steering wheel. Next, we took the 3D printer apart and used the motor to turn the gear which would steer the car. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, one has to train the Emotiv Epoc for about 15-20 mins for good performance. The signals from the EEG are linked with different \"thoughts\" like turn left, turn right etc. which are key binded to Gcode commands that move the motor which moves the gear which turns the car. </p>\n<p>Yes, it's pretty insane.</p>\n<p>One just has to watch it or try it. It's like magic.

Unfortunately, many aren't aware of this policy, and even if they are, it goes unused as it's a real hassle to do all the required legwork.</p>\n<p>Kickback is something that people could and should actually use.  A few days before LA Hacks, I bought a scooter. Just yesterday, the price dropped $10. Because the application hadn't yet been built, I had to go through the \"traditional\" process of verifying what I'd paid, checking the new price, finding the dates to see if I was eligible, and finally the tedious task of contacting Amazon. This experience made me realize how needed this product was.</p>\n<p>Kickback has literally no downsides to the consumer, and offers huge potential upsides.</p>\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n<p>Users log in through Google in our mobile application (or soon via a webapp), which also serves as a beautiful list of pending and successful refunds. We check your Gmail Inbox for new Amazon orders, and watch for fluctuations in price. If something drops (monitored via Amazon's Product Advertising API), not only do we recognize that you're owed a refund, but we also send an email on your behalf (from your account using the Gmail REST API) to Amazon, requesting that the difference be refunded to you.</p>\n<p>Your only interaction with Kickback will be to sign up once, and then receive push notifications whenever we've saved you money.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>We're pretty happy to have made a simple way to passively take advantage of a great policy that you may not have known existed. </p>\n<p>In terms of technical achievements, we were able to build a relatively scalable MVP in a short amount of time; we organized worker execution with simple in-memory schedulers that could probably handle hundreds or thousands of users as is.</p>\n<p>We also made a really pretty app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Kickback</h2>\n<p>This service could be very easily scaled; as more and more people automatically monitor products and get refunds, request overhead goes down due to overlap. The service could stay operational by charging a small percentage of each refund amount, or through donations. We built this on Azure, so it'd be dead simple to scale by switching to an actual Mongo cluster and a standard microservice architecture. </p>\n<p>In the future, we'd also want to use some of Azure's built in caching/queueing features to make this a bit more asynchronous; requests are currently done inline because of time constraints. The fact that Azure did basic DNS for us was <em>amazing</em>, huge props for that feature.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gmail\">gmail</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon\">amazon</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oauth\">oauth</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["UI/UX, Concept + Design Implementation ", "I built the backend systems that monitor your gmail inbox and Amazon orders.", "I built the iOS client, and set up login through the Gmail and Parse APIs."]], ["Protogen", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Protogen \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/333/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A want to design an app with a 3D input device, for the purpose of assisting people in understanding complicated biological topics that are otherwise difficult to understand.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>A blood vessel is simulated on-screen, as well as a user-modifiable virus.

QuestionnAIR aims to provide the user with any region's answer to a question (in our app we refer to questions as balloons) they have, effectively giving them their chosen society's \"correct\" answer to their inquiry. \nA region (in our app we refer to this as a skyline) is chosen by the user and could be limited to the app users within a 50 foot radius or open to the entire world. \nFor example, one could want to know what people think about the food at a particular restaurant, they could then release a balloon (place a question) asking that and only have the balloon (question) visible to user's within a 300 foot radius of the restaurant. The ability to set the ranges also allows for one to collect interesting data, for example, asking a question that is only viewable by those within New York.\nIn essence, it is an anonymous social media app that allows one to ask questions to domains of their choosing in order to receive the socially acceptable answer.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Setup:\nA user creates an account with Questionnaire through their preferred method of email, Facebook, or Twitter. Upon signing up they are given the option to add friends who use Questionnaire to their friend list. A user is then able to ask questions, which we call balloons. </p>\n<p>Asking Questions:\nUpon selecting a type of balloon, such as yes/no or multiple choice, they choose who is able to view the question, the skyline. \nAt this point they are given 3 options -\n1) To ask the question to their friends, either anonymously or not, by choosing \"Friendly Skies\"\n2) To ask the question anonymously to a chosen radius around them by choosing \"Local Skies\"\n3) To ask the question anonymously to the world by choosing \"Global Skies\"\nAfter making this choice the user selects a category to submit this question into, such as Health or Entertainment. </p>\n<p>Viewing Questions:\nUsers are able to view the questions that are available to them. They can sort these questions by the type of skyline (Friendly, local, and global). Once a chosen skyline is selected the questions within that scope are presented in an order based off the balloon's (question) popularity. Much like Yik Yak, users are able to add helium to the balloon (upvote) or deflate the balloon (downvote). Following the same algorithm Reddit uses, this ensures that good questions are highly visible and bad one's fall to the the ground where no one can see them. </p>\n<p>Gamification:\nIn order to increase user experience, we have added some game mechanics to the app. People love level systems and being able to see and track their progress,  since it allows for a sense of accomplishment. Thus, we added a title system. The title system gives user's a title that is displayed by their questions, on their profile, etc. Title's are awarded based on the overall popularity's of one's questions. Their are 5 unique Title classes or paths that one can follow, and within each path their are 9 levels. The class/path that a user is on is determined by where the majority of their popular balloons are posted. For example, if the majority of one's popular posts are within the \"Sci-Tech\" category, they embark on the Android/Cyborg path where you start out as the rank of \"Tin Man\" and can rank up with increasingly more popular questions to title's such as \"Inspector Gadget\".</p>\n<p>The title's also provide a certain level of utility besides being badges. If a user is a high rank, then they are someone who consistently ask great questions, which means they know and can recognize great questions when they see one. Thus, when they pump helium into a balloon (upvote) it adds more helium (points) to the balloon (question) than when a lower rank does. The same goes for deflating balloons. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we encountered is the time limit. We were unable to completely implement our ideas, and many additional features we had planned had to be left out due to the time limit. \nAnother large challenge we faced was the geo-caching of questions. We encountered several issues while testing out this feature. We would place a question, walk out of the question's range and check the app to make sure the question was no longer viewable, then walk back inside the range to confirm the question's visibility. More often then not, while walking back into range, the question wouldn't reappear on the app. After much frustration and troubleshooting we realized the issue was with the refresh rate of the phone's GPS, which was fixable by simply increasing the rate.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm particularly proud of our application's design and encompassing theme. Visually, the app looks great. I'm also proud of implementing the geo-cached question feature. The first time we successfully walked back into a question's range and it reappeared on the app, I let out a childlike squeal of joy.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Through the implementation of QuestionnAIR I have learned a lot about IOS development, Parse, Facebook graphic API, Twitter authentication API, and Apple's location manager. I have learned just what is possible in a 36 hour time frame and how rewarding it is to have something you can be proud of by the end of a hackathon. Finally, as this was my first hackathon, I have just how much fun and awesome hackathons are, as well as how little sleep I can function on.</p>\n<h2>What's next for QuestionnAIR</h2>\n<p>For QuestionnAIR we plan to finish implementing our planned features as well as add several additional features we brainstormed throughout the event. This would include things like further gamifying it, adding different skins/graphical layouts, and more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">facebook-graphic-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">twitter-authentication-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apple's-location-manager</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LAHacks2015/Questionnaire\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LAHacks2015/Questionnaire\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on setting up Parse, figured out the structure for posting questions and detecting when in range of a question.

Due to the drought in California, lakes, reservoirs, and even natural habitats continue to vanish from our ecosystem.  Therefore, it is absolutely essential to save water.  With a promisingly innovative solution, let us help you save the Earth, one Sprinkle at a time. </p>\n<h2>About It</h2>\n<p>Introducing Sprinkle, a \"smart\" sprinkler system that gives you control of your sprinklers from the palm of your hand!</p>\n<p>Through the mobile Sprinkle app, your sprinklers sitting around at home will take care of all your watering needs! With a simple swipe of your finger, this innovative solution will bend to your will and turn itself on or off! But that's not all the sprinkler can do. It can also retrieve information on weather forecasts. This allows the app to automatically know which days the plants will need watering and which days mother nature will take care of the plants. Now you don't need to worry about wasting water when you're relaxing on vacation, far away from home.</p>\n<p>Not only can you control your sprinkler system, but it will also update you on what your sprinkler believes is the best time to water your plants. With the increasingly harrowing growth of the California drought, this app will help with the conservation of water.  </p>\n<p>Many people allow their sprinklers to run, even if the rain will water your plants the following day. Though Sprinkle may seem like your average sprinkler, in actuality, it saves plenty of water and is smart enough to tell when it's raining outside. </p>\n<h1>How It Works</h1>\n<p>Through the smartphone, the user has control over their sprinkler.  Also the user can see what the current status of the sprinkler.  The smartphone connects to the same server as the Intel Edison, and through the Edison the users control the sprinkler's on and off ability.  The Edison also takes information from Mashape's Ultimate Weather Forecast API to determine if it will be wasteful to water the plants on not, depending on the weather (present, the past, and the future).

Despite that, however, downloading templates has always been a pain. It requires installing extensions that are only compatible with the Windows version of OneNote, completely ruining a great experience.</p>\n<p>Notegram takes downloading templates to a new level of simplicity. Just sign in with your Microsoft account, press the save button on a template you like, and that's it, you're done - the template is already in your OneNote. No need to download or install anything.</p>\n<p>Templates are automatically saved to your default notebook section - usually \"Quick Notes\".</p>\n<p>Notegram is completely platform independent, does not require installing any addons or extensions - all you need is a web browser.</p>\n<h2>Building Notegram</h2>\n<p>I have ventured into new territory for me with this project - I've never worked with Node.JS, or any kind of APIs before.\nI learned a lot about Node.JS, web development, and working with REST APIs while building Notegram. Not just that, the circumstances under which I built it were new to me as well - LA Hacks is the first hackathon that I have ever attended, and it has been quite an overwhelming experience for me. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Notegram</h2>\n<p>I would like to turn Notegram into a fully featured network for sharing OneNote templates and pages. </p>\n<p>OneNote already has powerful sharing capabilities, but Notegram can take this to a whole new level - sharing with the whole wide world.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Notegram is powered by OneNote, Node.JS, and Microsoft Azure.\nNotegram uses icons from the <a href=\"http://modernuiicons.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://modernuiicons.com</a> project.</p>\n<h2>Updates</h2>\n<p><strong>4/9/15:</strong> A new template, Accounting Journal, is now live!

Our project revolutionizes human biped control, by allowing the human user to simply stand in front of a camera instead of having to wear anything. It only requires a kinect sensor and a biped.  It is literally as simple as playing a game.

Cool visuals are simply not enough, which is why we created SmarTV.  SmarTV allows long-distance friends to watch shows together.  By connecting to smart home systems through Smart Things, SmarTV modifies the ambient conditions of the home to create a fully immersive experience by simulating the conditions of the video in the home.</p>\n<p>Introducing the new dimensions to your TV:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dimension 3 -- Mood Lighting:\nA Philips Hue bulb matches the coloring of a scene, reflecting the mood of a scene in real life with hue lighting.</li>\n<li>Dimension 4 -- Temperature Simulation:\nA Nest thermostat simulates the intended temperature of a scene based on a warmness/coolness score based on our color analysis algorithm.</li>\n<li>Dimension 5 -- Love:\nMovie Interstellar claims that love is the 5th dimension -- timeless. This is why we incorporated love into SmarTV. With our facial tracking and detection algorithm, you can view your family, special one, or friends' reaction to a particular scene right on your SmarTV, tunneling through time and space to connect people.</li>\n<li>Dimension 6 -- Feel:\nWho needs a remote when you can control a TV with gestures. We understand, no one want to reach for a remote when watching a movie. We incorporated Leap Motion gesture controls for basic functionalities such as play, pause, rewind, forward, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let's say you're watching Frozen.  As the scenes change to the icy kingdom, SmarTV controls your Phillips Hue lights to  match the cool blue of the Frozen scenery, and your Nest thermostat to adjust the temperature to a chilly 60.  Best of all, you can watch with a friend from anywhere in the world as if you were in the same room!  A camera monitors your expressions and whenever you change your expressions, your friend will be able to watch your reaction in a corner of the screen in real time!  And when you get tired of an episode and want to fast-forward, a simple gesture with the Leap Motion lets you control your entire movie-watching experience!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jaavascript</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">directv</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/philips-hue\">philips-hue</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/smartthings\">smartthings</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nest\">nest</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/groovy\">groovy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/renxinhe/LaHacks2015.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/renxinhe/LaHacks2015.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Speak Up", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Speak Up \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/294/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Speak Up \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/302/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A passion for great public speaking, and a desire to empower others to overcome their fear of it. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Uses IBM Watson's Speech to Text and Personality Insights services to create a personalized analysis of your public speaking performance, all hosted on the IBM Bluemix cloud.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Manipulating IBM Watson's personality attributes, creating post/get requests to pass JS objects between pages, manipulating UI elements, and lack of sleep.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Merged two services from Watson, wrote ajax calls to manipulate node data, built a clean UI.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Two new languages and a framework, Node.JS, Jade, and Express.

We also allow for the homeless to create a profile for themselves so that eventually negative social stigma against homelessness (e.g. homeless people are dangerous, being homeless is the homeless person's fault), will become fade away.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Hacking Homelessness is  a website that connects the homeless to shelters and possible sponsors to give them the support they need to stand on their own. Using the geo-location of where the homeless access the internet, we link him/her to the nearest shelter that provides the necessities they need. Then by either creating a Facebook account or logging into an existing one, we extract data from Facebook to create a profile on our website that tells potential supporters their story. After asking him/her questions about her background, aspirations, and everything in between, we create a biography using speech-to-text conversion (from IBM BlueMix) match them to a job using the personality insight service (again from BlueMix) to help the homeless person figure out a valuable skill they want to pursue. Then donors can look through various homeless peoples' profiles to see who they want to support.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Inexperience. Only one person in the team knew web development. Everyone in the team only knew C++, which is not even used for web development. 3 members of the team were a first-time hacker. For these reasons, many features that we would have liked to implement were improbable to execute with our low knowledge level. In addition, BlueMix's services didn't work for us.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even with almost literally no web development experience, we still managed to push out an okay looking and functional website. Creating something from scratch, especially something that we had absolutely no idea about, was a very challenging and rewarding experience. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>On top of learning new programming languages like Python, we also learned the basics of web development by trying out node.js, mongodb, and making a database out of flask and MySQL. Also, hackathons are awesome.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hacking Homelessness</h2>\n<p>A fully fleshed out website that implements the features that we had in mind (and maybe even more).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mondango</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hackinghomeless.tk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hackinghomeless.tk\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackinghomeless.tk</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Msgmood", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/410/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/280/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/283/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/282/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/553/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/555/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/556/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Msgmood \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/838/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h3>What is Msgmood?</h3>\n<p>Msgmood goes through your company's support emails and lets you know if the mood of your customers.

base inspiration for Auditionr comes from the experiences of our friends who are trying to make it in the film or theater industry. In today's market, one's ability to be cast in a production is often limited by their location, connections, and luck, as the age old system of in-person auditions  commonly requires that you travel large distances, know someone who can put you in a room with a director, or compete with people who have more fortune than you do. As a result, actors all around the world are left unable to make a living doing what they love, and directors all around the world are investing immense amounts of money in recruiting actors, yet missing out on some of the best talent.  </p>\n<p>Enter Auditionr. We provide a platform for conducting online auditions, accessible to everyone from James Cameron to the theater director in your local community, from recent acting school graduates to Leonardo Dicaprio. One of the largest advantages of in person auditions is that the actors can see each other and play off each other's acting, so we replicated that experience by putting you in a live stream with people auditioning for the other parts so that you can act through the script together. Anybody can try out for plays and movies or cast actors in the comfort of their home and with the convenience of the internet, and we hope this system will allow for greater productions, greater equality, and greater artistic expression.  </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The director of the play or movie posts their production on Auditionr, submitting a sample of their script along with a list of characters.</p></li>\n<li><p>Actors can browse the list of productions available and pick their favorites, choosing the characters they want to audition for.</p></li>\n<li><p>Auditionr will automagically put the auditioning actors into audition groups, each audition group containing one actor auditioning for each character.</p></li>\n<li><p>The audition will take place through a live video chat between all the actors in the group, allowing them to interact naturally with one another, and consists of the group of actors acting through the script sample in character.</p></li>\n<li><p>The director of the production will review audition tapes from each audition group, and pick out the actors they liked the best to cast.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for Auditionr</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowing directors to set up callbacks in order to see how certain actors interact with each other</li>\n<li>Scheduling for audition times</li>\n<li>A more comprehensive casting page to allow directors to better track the status of auditions</li>\n<li>Actor and director profiles</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/respoke\">respoke</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ziggeo\">ziggeo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">graph-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Pebble Hackawatch", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebble Hackawatch \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/424/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebble Hackawatch \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/423/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebble Hackawatch \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/419/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebble Hackawatch \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/454/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We loved the new interface of the Pebble Time smart watch and the introduction of its new feature, the Timeline. It's a new way to interact with our watches using the timely events we organize our days around.  We wanted to take this powerful new platform and apply it to hackathons.  We are empowering hackathon attendees to focus as much as they can on having fun and working on their projects while still providing them with the timely information they need to stay in the loop.  Now using our app, attendees can subscribe to the topics of events they're interested in (i.e. meal times, tech talks, activities) at hackathons and have them appear in their Timeline, as well as get notifications when new events are added or changed.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We wrote a Pebble Watchapp using their C library to pull a user's Timeline info to our backend API service, written in Node.js and using MongoDB.  With their Timeline info, we can then allow user's to select which topics of events they want to receive notifications and pins for in their timeline, a couple examples being when meals are to be served, when tech talks are happening and when the next coding challenge was going to be.  Using the PebbleKit JS library on top of our C app, we make requests to Pebble's Timeline API as well as our own via HTTP requests.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of the fact that we're one of the first in a group of developers to create something on Pebble's new 3.0 SDK, taking advantage of their new Timeline feature for Pebble Time watches.  In addition, we love the fact that we can give back to the hackathon community in a way that can truly help attendees have a better time at events.  We know we're going to look forward to utilizing Hackawatch at our upcoming DesertHacks hackathon at Arizona State University.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, we learned to develop using C, something that none of us had much experience going in to with this project.  We also learned what it takes to build on the Pebble platform, and got to use some cool beta features of the 3.0 SDK.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hackawatch</h2>\n<p>We plan to continue to refine the feature set, complete all event types and ready the app for other hackathons to fork the project and use it at their event.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/deserthacks/hackathon-pebble\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/deserthacks/hackathon-pebble\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://hackawatch.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hackawatch.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackawatch.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Created node.js backend for hackathon event system, integrated with C watchapp and PebbleKit JS code", "", ""]], ["Cafetera", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>A connected world at the social awareness level.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Farmers create profiles of themselves in order to 'brand' their product and have access to a reliable source of market statistics and receive a fair trade for their crop.

There are also extensive social plugins that allows people to like and share the charity of Samahope to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>We have created an App on Facebook called Dr. Sama. By establishing this App  with a platform of website that we have created earlier on, this App on Facebook has incorporated a lot of social plugins that make both our App and the website SamaHope become even more social . With the platform of website on Facebook, users could freely share and post news and updates about this social media charity app. Sharing and conversation are the key things that power our App and meet the goal of our charity.  Besides, users could grow our App by powering conversation through sharings on Faceook Messenger. By having facebook App, it greatly monetize our App and website with Ads and potentially increase our networking with other potential contributors.</p>\n<p>We have also submitted our App Dr. Sama for review on Facebook so the App will be listed on the App center. People, especially those are who affiliated with groups such as charity, funding, health and non-profit organization would be able to see our App on browser at the App Center. Apart from that, by publishing this App to iTunes and GooglePlay, we are able to reach even more targeted audience and potential contributors. With the integration of gamification in our social media App and the strengthening our networking through conversation in social media and sharings in extensive social plugins, it is optimistic that SamaHope could create even more fundings to support the work of doctors and to deliver higher quality healthcare service in developing countries.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Challenges that we encountered include that we were trying to create a built-in facebook game.

Students have been becoming more and more tech educated through the internet. A few years ago, taking a part an RC car and adding minor tweaks to it was really awesome. Nowadays, hacking an RC car is the norm. What we set sights is implementing the future of tech into a product of the present for kids to learn from.</p>\n<p>We used Intels Edison Board, an RC car, an android phone, azure for cloud service and a xbox 360 controller to control the vehicle. We deconstructed the RC car and attached the wires to the motors of the drone. We also attached an android phone to the top of the drone. From here, we connected and programmed a xbox 360 controller to the laptop, allowing us to control the vehicles throttle and turning. This information is sent to our cloud server, AZURE using node.js.  From there, it sends information to the android phone via wifi/cellular. We connected the android phone to EDISON via bluetooth. Edison is wired to the motors of the car which tells the vehicle to go forward or which way to turn! ALSO, we were able to live stream from the android phone attached on the car! This information is sent to the client (laptop) and people can watch our live stream! ( See attached graphic!)</p>\n<p>We ran into a lot of bugs that took away from working on other parts of our project. </p>\n<p>Being able to make such a complex system which accomplishes what we initially set out to do. We had a lot of trouble here and there and we were going to drop some ideas. However, we pushed through and did everything we set out to do. This was also the first time our team has worked together and it was amazing. The delegation of tasks was beautiful and we have a better appreciation of everyone on the team. </p>\n<p>We learned how to effectively work as a team and finish what we started. We had to learn new languages, change languages, apply new things like azure and the built in features of the edison board and we did a great job. We also learned TCP sockets</p>\n<p>We will use this hack to show kids what we did and what they can do themselves. We have various cities lined up to show this product including Sacramento, Los Angeles, Inland Empire and OC county. We will target High School Hackathons to promote innovation and to hack the future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">android-phone</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">live-stream</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heywatch-http-live-streaming\">heywatch-http-live-streaming</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">xbox360</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tcp\">tcp</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wifi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/austinlchang/RCGD-Server\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/austinlchang/RCGD-Server\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Mozoby/RCGD-Client\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Mozoby/RCGD-Client\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Mozoby/RCGD-Android-App\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Mozoby/RCGD-Android-App\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Mozoby/RCGD-Edison\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Mozoby/RCGD-Edison\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on prgramming the arduino to the RC smart car.

Therefore, we initiated and constructed a system that reflects both of our experiences as mentors/professors and the needs that thousands of students have.\nWe are convinced that there are many factors that affect student performance that go beyond academics. For this reason our system does not conform to the success of few but rather continues to evolve to become as personalized as needed to guarantee the success of each and every student!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>*Eliminates blind tutoring: Know with precision the students' weaknesses to target those specific areas and ultimately master common core standards.\n*Mystro offers full detailed student reports that allows continuous monitoring on students' progress. All data is recorded and used as reference to demonstrate growth.\n*Encouraging the community to collaborate together by providing full recurring reports on students' progress to their parents in the language of their choice. In addition, parents and professors can send messages back and forth in their native languages and our app will translate the message to the chosen language of the recipient. Our app support 50+ languages.\n*School-based agenda that helps students be on top of their assignments. Provides upcoming tests, deadlines, and events notifications. Facilitates time management for students.\n*Discussion boards and direct messaging available to facilitate communication between instructors, students, and parents.\n*Different resources that allows instructors to develop and upload videos, worksheets and online activities.\n*Reliable predictions based on students' progress that allows instructors and students to foresee success or failure. \n*Outstanding student achievement is compensated with recognition by their instructors and scholarship opportunities.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>At first we expected to integrate many API's (Azure, Moxtra, Wolfram Alpha, IBM Watson) but due to time constraints we were unable to integrate all of them. Creating and consuming a Mobile Service API hosted on Windows Azure was new to us, so we needed to read the documentation throughly to create our app.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our greatest accomplishment was the development of a functional app that has a great potential in education. Though hard work, we were able to implement different functionalities into a one single and useful app, Mystro. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Our main learning outcome was the ability to work with Microsoft Azure, Xamarin, and how to implement Moxtra, and Wolfram alpha to improve our app in the future. In addition, we learned that having the access to API's is essential to a faster development of apps because they provide the tools that can make your ideas come true.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Mystro</h2>\n<p>We want to continue working on this project to implement as many tools needed to help students succeed in their educational goals. Our vision for this project is to get professors, parents, and students connected. In the early stage of this app, we want to focus on elementary school, middle school, and high school students, but our ultimate goal is to impact education at all levels.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xamarin\">xamarin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-translator\">bing-translator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gravatar\">gravatar</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-analytics\">google-analytics</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/asp-net\">asp.net</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mystro.azurewebsites.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mystro.azurewebsites.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mystro.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LAHacks-Tritons/Mystro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LAHacks-Tritons/Mystro\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.haikudeck.com/app/edit/ZG6giRKXZr#\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.haikudeck.com/app/edit/ZG6giRKXZr#\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.haikudeck.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["SnapHunt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SnapHunt \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/795/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SnapHunt \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/793/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SnapHunt \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/774/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SnapHunt \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/772/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Snapchat is a great application but many times you simply don't have any good ideas of what to snap. SnapHunt is the first game for Snapchat that can be played directly inside the application with your friends where the game dictates what you snap. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>All you need to do is add our bot, send a message to invite your friend, and wait for his acceptance of the match. Once both parties agree to play the game, a random word will be messaged to both of your Snapchats and whoever is the first to take a picture that identifies the word will win. Our bot runs on the <strong>Linode cloud hosting platform</strong>, uses <strong>Mashape</strong> to perform object recognition as well as Natural Language Processing to further increase confidence in a correct decision about the word being made. We also leverage <strong>Moxtra</strong> to provide a gallery of past match winners as well as allow discussions on the matches and show the crazy items that users had to find. Lastly but most importantly, we used a 3rd party Snapchat PHP API to control the Snapchat bot that hosts the game.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Performing image recognition is not an easy task. Fortunately, Mashape provides a few API's that helps us out. However, to further increase the confidence that a users image accurately defines the requested word, we created an algorithm that uses NLP to lead to better judgments.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Snapchat has no official API, thus it requires a lot of hackery in order leverage their services. They also have systems in place that attempt to decrease the use of 3rd party applications - this forced us to leave Namecheap hosting and instead use the platform offered by Linode. Ultimately, we created a feature for Snapchat that uses their API in a new and unintended way that will lead to fun user experiences.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for SnapHunt</h2>\n<p>Becoming an official feature in Snapchat and paving the way for many more games.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mashape\">mashape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/moxtra\">moxtra</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/snapchat\">snapchat</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["SpaceGame(usingLEAPmotion)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Get the keys to the sun before they get sucked in my the black hole...

MusicFace uses several APIs to generate a Spotify playlist of songs it thinks you might like. It's a quick and easy way to get your jam on and maybe even discover new music in the process. </p>\n<h2>How it works \u266c</h2>\n<p>MusicFace uses your browser's webcam to take a picture of your face.

team developed a novel stock-market prediction algorithm whose utility can be harnessed by way of a user-friendly, intuitive app.  With the aim of both ameliorating the overwhelming barrier-of-entry for individuals interested in beginning down the investment path and bolstering/diminishing the confidence of seasoned stock-traders, this framework makes use of complex financial information within a seamless, inviting user-interface. Specifically, the workflow amalgamates historical data from technical analysis (i.e derivative crossings of moving averages) and semantic analyses (i.e press-release content) to provide a rich feature-set to a combination of support-vector-machine and lasso algorithms which then predict an individual company\u2019s closing stock price for the next trading-day. As a proof-of-concept, we built a model for Amazon\u2019s stock (NASDAQ: AMZN). Trained on technical and semantic data from 2014, our model was then tasked with predicting Amazon\u2019s price for each day of 2015\u2014 an undertaking that significantly accounted for over 50% of the variance in stock-price fluctuations (r=.7, p=.000004)  and achieved 83% accuracy in binary discretions (i.e whether the stock was up or down given the preceding set of information).  </p>\n<h2>How unique was the idea behind the hack?</h2>\n<p>Our team combines extensive knowledge in financial analysis, machine learning algorithms, design, and cognitive neuroscience to create a unique attempt to predict stock market trends.  While many have previously attempted to automate stock predictions, our hack is unique for two reasons in particular: (1) a synthesis of experience-based insights yielding data sets that are not typically incorporated in stock-prediction algorithms and (2) an intuitive and smooth user interface through which users will be able to interact with these data-driven insights in an informative and non-intimidating manner.  Though these two attributes make us stand out from what is normally a very crowded space to develop novel solutions in, our favorite aspect of our project is the transparency we were able to achieve.  When providing a prediction for upcoming stock prices, our app confidently displays the accuracy with which we\u2019ve made similar positions in the past and provides specific insights as to the mechanisms contributing to this particular prediction.  Thus, the end-user, in what we believe to be an unprecedented event, can easily produce a stock prediction, see what it would have been like if they followed through on this prediction in the past, and identify the key components behind this prediction simultaneously.</p>\n<h2>How technically challenging is the hack?</h2>\n<p>Our hack leverages the skills we have as cognitive neuroscience students interested in the stock market and app-development, namely our collective expertise in machine learning, financial analysis, and user-interface design.  This project required proprietary information that a member of our group had acquired over a successful career as a day-trader; these insights would not necessarily to be obvious\u2014even to those conversant in the financial sector. Quantifying this essentially guttural inclination was a substantial technological burden. Thus, the feature-collection aspect of this hack was particular challenging; our team had to build unique feature sets that drew on financial-time series data as well as conduct an in-house sentiment analysis that relied on both latent semantic analysis and linear discriminant analysis. Additionally, this project required a broad knowledge of machine learning algorithms capable of binary and continuous classification\u2014a toolkit that the PhD students on our team utilize on a daily basis for \u201cmind-reading\u201d by way of combining neuroimaging (e.g fMRI) with machine learning.  Lastly, the successful implementation of an end product mandated the development a robust user-interface mockup and nascent versions of the app for both iOS and Android mobile devices.  This hack required a diverse and deep set of knowledge that few teams would be able to compile and execute over the course of a weekend.  </p>\n<h2>How good was the implementation?</h2>\n<p>The foremost concern of our hack was the accuracy of our learning algorithm and retaining the ability to confidently and elegantly display its results.  We have gone through numerous rounds of quality assurance to make sure our results accurately reflect the performance of our algorithms.  These tests include classic machine learning sanity checks such as shuffling input data and using Gaussian noise as a feature set so as to demonstrate that the algorithm is not inherently biased in its predictions as a result of coding and data-organization error. \nOur results surprised even us\u2014the ubiquitous success met by our prediction scheme is both reliable and powerful. Across more than a dozen companies, we could predict whether or not a stock would close up or down the following day (which would allow the end-user to act upon this information in the interim) with a range of 65% to 85%. Additionally, our workflow is capable of producing a continuous class label indicative of the magnitude of the stock\u2019s movement. This class-label allowed us to create a follow-through simulation that made purchases and sales based on both the binary classification and the forecasted magnitude of the stock\u2019s movement. That is, for each day preceding our training-set we could predict whether a particular stock would rise or fall, by what degree, and if that measure passed our user-provided risk aversion threshold. In so doing, we were able to create a simulation that showed the potential for capital growth of a user employing the services of YAMS on January 1st, 2015. Our simulations suggest that if someone were to begin using our algorithms for trading over the past year, an initial $5,000 would have grown into about $6,300.  We feel as though this simulation will quickly stimulate the growth of a user-base as well as encourage revenue from potential advertisers (we can compare the capital growth when using a standard brokerage that charges $7.00 for each trade with that of RobinHood who tout a no-commission brokerage service). </p>\n<h2>More Information</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/document/d/1ZbbV2pDlldJasZyi8mM0UewKehXzsip90sW4Lgl2ny0/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://docs.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/document/d/1ZbbV2pDlldJasZyi8mM0UewKehXzsip90sW4Lgl2ny0/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">framer</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/coffeescript\">coffeescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wolfram-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">support-vector-machines</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lasso-regression</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yahoo-finance</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/dropbox\">dropbox</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://xdlin.com/framer/yams\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://xdlin.com/framer/yams\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>xdlin.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the creation of the technical and semantic feature sets.

We use many applications on a daily basis that involve creating and sharing data. We think it's important as a consumer to understand what is happening to the data we create and try to work towards a transparent and easy to understand future for connected applications and services.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Terms is an iOS app that identifies the applications that you have installed on your device and delivers information about explains the services they provide and how they are using your data. We integrated a service that delivers ratings of the terms and conditions of a number of popular services. We enable the user to easily explore and learn more about the applications installed on their phone and the services they use everyday.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating Terms involved the aggregation of a wide range of data not only about the quality of the terms of services being used but also in the apps installed on your phone. Delivering all of this information in an easy to read and intuitive way was one of the larger challenges involved. Exploring iOS networking as well as the Interface Builder were also some hurdles we had to overcome. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Delivering a working project at the end of the weekend has to be the biggest accomplishment. We are very proud of the level of polish we feel we were able to put into the application as well as the process we used for development. We developed the application in a very sustainable and manageable way with clear goals and milestones throughout the process. This focused approach allowed us to get more sleep than we were expecting (that is a complete lie, 5 hours was had at the max)</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Developing a functional application over the course of a weekend is the perfect way to be exposed to a bunch of new technologies and tools and have to quickly learn how to deal with them. We were not very familiar with iOS and had to learn how to use everything from the Interface Builder (which is a nightmare) to how to perform simple HTTP requests. Being able to implement these things under pressure was a very informative (and stressful) experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for terms-app</h2>\n<p>We were hoping to be able to build a social component into Terms over the course of the weekend but that proved to be too ambitious. We would like to extend upon the app to allow for people to criticize, learn about and discuss the terms of services and practices of the applications they use. Integrating a discussion board and collaborative editing are the first steps we will likely take to help Terms achieve it's goal of helping people learn more about the tools they use</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nicolaslangley/terms-app\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nicolaslangley/terms-app\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Shower Tunes", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shower Tunes \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/349/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>With the severity of droughts increasing rapidly in California, the importance to conserve water has also been increasing. \nThe average American family of four consumes an average of 400 gallons per day.

Our app allows them to hold a flash sale where students may buy food at considerable discounts, allowing the business to keep more money and feed these starving students. We initially faced some challenges using Firebase, but found that Parse worked well for storing our deals and restaurants data.

Patients come back time after time again with the exact same problems.</p>\n<p>Many times a doctor\u2019s office is the only support environment for a patient\u2019s condition, but doctors can only do so much. A physician\u2019s care starts at the clinic and ends and the clinic. How can quality support go beyond the clinic?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is a lack of access to quality support beyond the clinic setting and inadequate connections between people who truly understand what you are going through.</p>\n<h1>What is Eden?</h1>\n<p>Eden essentially is a social support network for people with similar afflictions to form communities where they can ask questions and find quality answers that are moderated by health professionals. In addition, users can also blog about their medical afflictions and share with their friends.</p>\n<p>(Eden is a Facebook for patients with Quora functionalities)</p>\n<p>Collectively, Eden provides a very holistic service that can support people with chronic afflictions outside of a clinical setting.</p>\n<h1>Datasets</h1>\n<p>We used Bloomberg datasets on \"Obesity\" and \"Diabetes Mellitus\" rate in the U.S. as well as some European countries to estimate the risk of these two diseases for each user depending on their age group. If they surpass a threshold risk, we would confirm their status via a message and suggest joining the obesity or diabetes community. Through such a process, we can offer and provide support early in disease progress, give them prevention advice, and improve disease prognosis.</p>\n<p>We also used \"Tobacco Average Spending\" dataset to calculate how much an average smoker spends on tobacco products, and set a personal goal for them, such as saving money to buy something or plan for their dream vacation, etc. By setting a personal goal in addition to hearing other Eden users\u2019 stories on how they quit tobacco, they can find some inspiration and motivation to reduce their tobacco use.</p>\n<h1>Technologies Used</h1>\n<p>Backend: firebase (in a transition to PostgreSQL, nodejs and express)</p>\n<p>Frontend: AngularJS</p>\n<h1>How to run it?</h1>\n<p>sudo grunt --force</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apacheconf</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NickGod/eden-full-stack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NickGod/eden-full-stack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Srizzle/sql-search\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Srizzle/sql-search\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["ADigest", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ADigest \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/311/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ADigest \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/316/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ADigest \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/313/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Do you feel annoyed with email ads?

Based on the mood calculated, we provide media content that can help you change or improve your mood. In this iteration, we are delivering customized content for the 'Happy, 'Sad', 'Surprised', and 'Angry' emotions. </p>\n<p>Our dashboard also tracks your moods over time, presenting you with a big-picture look at your emotional health. We hope that such a tool can help people become aware of their emotional patterns, and become more emotionally intelligent.</p>\n<p>We also have Kinect integration, so that you can begin a session the moment that you walk into the room. The Kinect can detect your presence, and open the MindMe website so that you don't forget to. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating the emotion tracking software and producing quantifiable results from it, providing new, non-static content based on emotional state, Kinect integration.</p>\n<p>However, everything works!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Everything works, and is fully testable. You can start tracking your emotional health today! Just go log into our website and give it a spin.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>JavaScript, Kinect development, emotion/mood tracking.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MindMe</h2>\n<p>We plan to monetize by also delivering custom ads based on your mood! Who doesn't like shopping?

The social touch of people reading books and discussing them together is now lost in this world of Kindles and E-Readers. Also, the cost of physical books has deterred several book lovers from buying them. Some of these people even resort to piracy.\nWhat our inspiration behind BookShare is - To get people together, to connect people who share similar interests in books. As we see it - Books can be a person's best friends, and they can help us find other friends.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>BookShare will allow each user to create their own profile, where they can add and delete books to lend out to other users. Users can then check within a 5 mile radius of their location, for people who are ready to share the book. These people will specify a period of days for which they are comfortable sharing their book. The user can determine which user they are most comfortable borrowing from, and then contact details of that user will be given. \nWithin this limited period of time, we were able to implement the functionalities of adding books, deleting books, and browsing through users within a 5 mile radius. We also wish to add other functionalities like reviews of books posted by the different users, recommending books that were liked by other similar users, and basically expand on this idea to create a social connected network of book lovers. But one important thing that we would like to stress on is keeping the entire service free, since our motivation is getting people connected, and not profiting from this.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There were several challenges that we ran into, which began when we decided to use IBM's BlueMix API to develop our web application. We started off using JSP, but due to some issue we could not make use of the provided Geocoding Service, and unfortunately even the experts from IBM could not help us out. Hence with around 20 hours to go, we had to prepare ourselves to implement the entire web application from scratch, using the Foundation framework for Front End, and PHP for Back End. We also experienced some difficulty while using the Google Maps API, since combining that with Foundations framework was giving us some technical difficulty.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The most important accomplishment that the three of us thing have established, is the idea itself. As several of the speakers spoke about, in the opening ceremony, in today's world where we spend more time on our phones than with our loved ones, getting people connected is the most important challenge. This becomes slightly more difficult with introverts, which is generally the case with people who read and love books. Hence we focused on that particular domain of people. We took quite some time brainstorming on the idea, checking on if the idea could lead to rights management issues, thinking of what the ideal application would be like, and finally setting a fixed set of goals for the duration of LA Hacks. So, the accomplishment we feel most proud of, is coming up with the idea, and implementing a primitive form of it within a span of 36 hours.\nApart from that, we believe that at the end of the Hackathon, we feel extremely proud of the fact that all three of us were over here, at Pauley Pavilion, for the entire event, and that we managed to develop something meaningful. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a number of things over the duration of the event. First, all three of us are Back End developers, and none of us were generally comfortable with Front End Development. But over the entire development cycle, at some or the other point of time, each one of us had to work with Front End, and we can proudly say that we gave it our best. We faced the challenge of doing something we were not generally comfortable with, and we are happy with the end result. \nWe also learned how different kinds of APIs could be used. Though we could not use multiple APIs, we did check quite a few of them, from Mashape and other websites, but could not find the right fit for our requirements.</p>\n<h2>What's next for BookShare</h2>\n<p>Getting a seed investor.

The inspiration behind his idea was when he saw some of his close friends go through some tough times. While that was going on, they were not able to recognize the deterioration of their mental health and therefore they couldn't make an active effort to fix the problem. After coming to LAHacks and seeing the various APIs, we decided to expand from just the quiz. We now have an entire ambient environment changing system as well. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Smyle has a database of questions stored on Microsoft Azure in a MySQL database. These questions are then sorted and tagged with point values that are based on the response levels. The front end Android or Web application pulls 10 of these questions daily and formats them into a short, 1-2 minute quiz to analyze the user's personality for the day. The information is then uploaded back to the user's data on Azure and analyzed. It returns a score that is then plotted on a chart for: Final Scores, Stress Levels, Confidence Levels. And after the daily quiz is done, the ambient environment is enabled. </p>\n<p>The ambient environment includes colored lights from the Phillips Hue bulbs and music from a bluetooth speaker. The environment can also be expanded to set the climate using the Nest APIs but we weren't able to get our hands on a Nest to hack on. The music choices and lighting colors are picked based on your mood from our analysis. For example, if you are happy, the color of the light would be a very light blue and the music playing would be an upbeat, energetic song. However, if you were feeling sad, the color would be a more uplifting color that gradually becomes brighter to help provide a subconscious change to both the environment and your mind. We performed some psychology color research and got most of our information from <a href=\"http://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/</a>. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into a lot of challenges with implementing the Azure API and using the smart products. Most of our team was full of fresh hackers who have only attended one or two hackathons before, and we were really looking forward to learning the new APIs and services available here. We all deviated from our comfort zones and learned a lot about cloud services, web development, and the internet of things. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We as a team are incredibly proud that we were able to make a functional website and Android application. No one on our team had any web development or internet connectivity experience and we all learned new things over the 36 hours that we were here. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Shivam learned how to connect Android applications to the internet and connect them to the cloud and how to connect to the internet of things and smart products like nest and Philips Hue. \nKaran learned a whole lot of web development in terms of HTML, CSS, and JS, languages he had little prior experience with. \nAdarsh learned a lot about mobile and software development, a side he had no prior experience with and also was able to expand his hardware knowledge. \nMatheus learned Unity by attending the Microsoft workshop though it was not part of our hack. \nAnd we all learned a ton about Microsoft Azure by hanging out with the Microsoft mentors and learning from them on how to incorporate the cloud services into our app. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Smyle</h2>\n<p>Smyle is looking forward to expanding the research on the psychoanalysis and also implementing the smart products as an entire connected system. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet

The beauty of ERIC comes in his ability to read your mood through the Emotiv EEG Headset to prompt more relevant conversation.  The experience is made even more tactile by the Leap-Motion enhanced playground that allows you to fiddle with virtual blocks during your psychotherapeutic experience!  Lastly, ERIC uses text-to-speech technology to provide both vocal and textual feedback.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>1) Getting Emotiv to work via web client despite very sparse, unorganized documentation<br/>\n2) Connecting the LeapMotion with our Three.js WebGL environment<br/>\n3) Finding smart ways to enhance ERIC's conversational skills  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>1) Overcoming the aforementioned challenges<br/>\n2) Creating our own collision detection system for our virtual blocks + Leap-Motion hands<br/>\n3) Really pretty \"feel\" to our app  </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Two members of our team were fairly new to web development.  We were able to learn basic HTML+CSS web design, some JavaScript, and even some 3D web programming!  Kelly, after programming for the first time implemented our block system using Three.js and Physi.js!!  Liem, a freshman in high school, owned our web and graphic design, and contributed to our front-end code as well.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ERIC</h2>\n<p>We plan to further push ERIC's interactive capabilities using more complex NLP strategies.  We also wanted to incorporate speech-to-text recognition, but decided not to given our time constraints and the loud, hectic nature of hackathon pitch expos.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/emotiv\">emotiv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">text-to-speech</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">physi.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mashape\">mashape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">eliza.js</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["HomeSafe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HomeSafe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/816/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HomeSafe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/914/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration - Clenching keys in between your fingers, double checking the back seat in a dark parking lot, turning on all the lights as soon as you get home so it doesn't seem like you're home alone - We've all been there. Fear of unprovoked violence is an unfortunate reality that all of us have to deal with, and it's a shame that in today's day in age we aren't using our most valuable asset to its fullest potential; technology. Making emergency phone calls in times of duress have proven to be unreliable, risky, and slow. People need something that works quickly without hassle. This was the inspiration behind HomeSafe.</h2>\n<h2>How it works - HomeSafe uses a safety system that requires the user to place their fingertip on the screen of their smartphone during unsafe everyday situations. These situations can include the walk home after a late class or venturing out to your car in a dimly lit parking lot. If the user's fingertip leaves the screen for longer than fifteen seconds, indicating an emergency of some sort, the authorities are notified with text-to-voice speech using previously entered data (name, age, weight, ethnicity) as well as the user's location.</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into - We didn't know how we were going to implement the text-to-speech feature, but after checking Mashape we found the Twilio API had everything that we needed and more. We had in depth discussions as to how we felt we could solve the complex problem. After passing around many solutions and ideas, we're confident that we've found the best solution which will help not only to alleviate the fears faced by thousands everyday, but potentially save lives.</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of - None of us had ever used Xcode or developed on iOS before, so we were really happy to have a finished product at the end of the hackathon! We felt that this project was challenging enough to push our limits and we still had fun with it.</h2>\n<h2>What we learned - The project has really helped us expand into another realm of mobile development both technically and ethically. The social issues raised by our project opened our eyes to the realities of senseless assault and the problem it poses. We're here to try and solve that!</h2>\n<h2>What's next for HomeSafe - In the future we really want to add an option where the user can choose what phone number is contacted if their finger loses contact with the screen. This could eliminate situations where the police may not be needed but are contacted anyway. Other options for the future include allowing geo-fences so that once the user leaves a specified area, the service is active and on high alert.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mashape\">mashape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nathankerr96/LAHACKS2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nathankerr96/LAHACKS2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["DJ4uand.me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/130/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/135/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/136/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/129/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/128/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/127/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/126/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DJ4uand.me \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/125/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>dj4uand.me is a crowd-sourced playlist generator which allows users to submit\nsong requests to a single \"DJ\" device. </p>\n<p>Though dj4uand.me, listeners are able to connect to a host's playlist in real\ntime and browse upcoming songs and make requests.</p>\n<p>DJs and listeners have to option to vote to veto songs, as well as upvote\nsongs as they see fit.

Innovations have hit an exponential growth spurt. In order to keep up and continue the expansion, the job rests upon our younger generation. Airithmetic was inspired by the idea that children need to be exposed to programming and the idea behind calculations rather than simply using what's already available at their fingertips. It would expose them to being able to create something useful and that they would understand and can learn from using new technology.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Airithmetic uses a Leap Motion sensor with an infrared camera that has the ability to track movements of a person's hand as it moves across the sensor. Users will look at the screen and wave their hand over the sensor and choose cubes to connect and create a simple mathematical equation that they will later test themselves and input numbers into the variables. Users can choose between the 4 main operations; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>\n<p>Moving their hand over the sensor will move the robotic hand on the screen and users can drag and move around different cubes and by tapping on different cubes, can connect them to form a flow diagram with variable inputs entering operation functions and have outputs exiting. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team ran into multiple challenges, a major one being that none of us had any experience in graphics or using languages such as Unity and C#. We had high ambitions, but had to scale our projects back to meet the deadline with the resources and knowledge available.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Each of us have our own accomplishments that we are proud of. Our biggest accomplishment is learning all that we did in such a short period of time. We are proud of our teamwork and how we were able to split up tasks to complete and combine to make this project. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Having never touched or heard of Unity, we all had to learn it. We also learned C# together. Overall, we also learned of each other's strengths and weaknesses and were able to capitalize on that. Learning how to combine projects and really work on a team was something we all had fun learning together as it's new compared to the academic solo environment.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Airithmetic</h2>\n<p>Airithmetic will one day be able to expand and help children and anyone interested in learning simple steps in programming. Through using flow based programming in a fun and easy to use interface, it will get more children and people excited about being a part of the technological fields. As of now we have only simple operations, but in the future, it will expand to incorporate actual functions and creating functions that can use each other to be like a flow based programming language that is simple enough for the most basic and untrained person to use.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Budge", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budge \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/327/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budge \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/359/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Budge \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/391/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: Difficult to decide where to plan out and go out.

With the advent of wearable technology for analyzing Brainwaves like Neurosky, Emotiv, and Muse, we thought we can make this thing happen. Our hack is the beginning of a new division in brain workouts.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We employ two kinds of feedback here, vibratory feedback and visual feedback. We used pebble smartwatch to provide vibratory feedback and we employed smartthings to get the visual feedback. This hack is for students who would want to improve their productivity. \nVibratory feedback: When a student is concentrating on his/her studies we use Neurosky Mindwave to to detect his/her concentration levels and we vibrate Pebble watch when he/she gets distracted.\nVisual feedback: When a student wants to relax for a while, he can just try relaxing and when he/she reaches a particular state of relaxation, the light turns off, and the challenge is to keep the light off.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The MindWave does very little to abstract away the cryptic EEG intensity data the device reads out. Our team was tasked with taking the raw data readings regarding the intensity of various brain wave frequencies and mapping them to more abstract concepts regarding relaxation, attention, and drowsiness. Extensive experimentation, signal processing, and data analysis techniques were explored and employed through our project. Our team also needed to explore various devices and APIs across multiple platforms in order to connect our MindWave device to the world. This included connecting Pebble, Smartthings, and MindWave technologies through Android, Mac, and Web platforms. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>In our short time, our team explored many new technologies with different underlying tools, designs, and challenges, yet we continuously managed to adapt to the demands of our project. Even with our varied backgrounds and skills, everyone still put in the work to read documentation, develop, test, debug, and read even more documentation. Especially on the data analysis end, our team dug deep and far for ways to better our understanding of brainwaves and their relation to our physiology, mentality, and lifestyle. Our results are not only a product of our hard work but our passion and understanding for the prospects and potential of neurofeedback.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Phocus</h2>\n<p>Our team is continuing to explore machine learning and data mining techniques in order to better extrapolate the physiological state of the user. We have experimented with Azure's machine learning cloud solutions and hope to fully utilize their technologies to streamline and execute the model training process. Our team is also exploring other technologies which could be leveraged in the home or student's lives to better productivity, including temperature control based on drowsiness, etc</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/smartthings\">smartthings</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mindwave</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">volley</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kidwalom/EyesDownLightsOut\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kidwalom/EyesDownLightsOut\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end development of the application as well connecting the application to smart watches ", "", "", ""]], ["PartySafe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PartySafe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/053/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PartySafe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/369/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PartySafe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/370/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"PartySafe \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/368/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Physical and sexual assault still remain a huge issue, even in modern society.

Once you enter the app, you can use the buttons on the right side of the watch to select one of the options and immediately connect to your phone for help.</p>\n<p><strong>Call Emergency Contact</strong>\nWhen you download the Wrist Watch app onto your Android phone, you will enter in the name and phone number of an emergency contact.</p>\n<p>When you press the top button, the watch will connect through Bluetooth to your phone and will call your designated emergency contact.</p>\n<p><strong>Call 911</strong>\nWhen you press the select button, the watch will connect through Bluetooth to your phone and will dial 911.</p>\n<p><strong>Send Text Message</strong>\nWhen you download the Wrist Watch app onto your Android phone, you will enter in the names and phone numbers of reserve emergency contacts as well as the warning text message you would like to send.</p>\n<p>When you press the bottom button, the watch will connect through Bluetooth to your phone and will send your preset text message to your reserve emergency contacts.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We split our team in half, with one team working on the Android interface and the other half working on the Pebble interface.</p>\n<p>This was a unique challenge because both sides had to work with languages we had never worked with before LA Hacks.  We spent a considerable chunk of time running through tutorials and documentation before we put any code down.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we have made an app that can help people.  It is not just for a certain niche market\u2014this app can be used by anyone who needs to get help.</p>\n<p>We are also happy with the amount of knowledge we will be walking away with at the end of the day.

We started by projecting down an image of a desktop. Using the IR camera embedded in the Wiimote we can then use the IR pen as a mouse to draw paths for Alfred to trek. </p>\n<p>Using the Kinect sensor we implemented color tracking. Two different reference colors on Alfred were used to determine where he is going and oriented in the world. A third color was used to give Alfred a target to head towards. We then gave him servo arms to grab onto his ball once he was in range.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately our projector combined with the lighting of event produced a washed out image that produced quite a bit of noise in guiding Alfred. So we instead trained him to chase his trusty green ball Wilson. </p>\n<h2>Alfred's new life</h2>\n<p>Alfred now spends most his days chasing wilson and trying to grab him using his servo powered arms. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rftransceivers</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">kinectsdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tape</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wiimote</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">infared</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Seamless", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Seamless \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/892/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Seamless \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/894/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Seamless \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/898/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Seamless \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/899/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Seamless \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/890/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>We aim to create a more enriching television watching experience for DirecTV users and keep them hooked on to it more than ever before.

Staying in shape is even harder, especially with the many social activities, extracurriculars, jobs, school work, and other stressful happenings that occur in our day to day lives. Staying healthy is the key to living longer and having a happier life and we wished to create an application that would help us and others in attaining this in a fun and supportive atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>This application brings people who want to stay healthy and get in shape together in an understanding, supportive, and energetic environment. With the global society we live in and the fact that humans are inherently social beings, this application brings these qualities together in order to help people in the journey to a healthier lifestyle while socializing and training at the same time. You create an account and look for people with similar training interests, capabilities, and nearby locations in our database. You can swipe people to the left saying you don\u2019t like them, or you can swipe them to the right, saying you do like them and would wish to train with them. If you both of you wish to train together, you appear in each other\u2019s matched lists and can then begin socializing and training.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>We ran into several challenges in the way. Besides the technical issues in the beginning with software and the Internet, many of us in the group were not experienced Android developers and we had to figure out how to use the given APIs available to us and make use of them. That was one of the easier challenges though. The biggest challenge we faced was implementing our matching algorithm in a fluid and interactive user interface for the user. This is a user based application and we wished to make it an amazing experience for the user. </p>\n<h2>What\u2019s Next?</h2>\n<p>We still have bugs to work out and even many more features we wish to implement. We plan to add location based functionality, chat rooms/messaging, and more detailed profiles, so keep a look out for our app! GymBuddies has a bright future ahead of itself with what we want to do and we are excited for what is to come. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sswdavid/LAHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sswdavid/LAHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I typed stuff", "", "", ""]], ["Map Motion", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>Inspiration</h1>\n<p>Simply put, we wanted to work on a project of the future.

Our objective was to create an application that allows the user to feel the full extent of Pebble's goal.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>There are two parts to this product.  Thus I will be explaining how each part works separately and how they utilize one another.  The first part we created is an Android application that freely communicates with the Pebble application we created.  The Android application receives signals from the Pebble application indicating a specific gesture was made using arm signals.  Using this information, the application based on options setup by the user, performs an action on the device such as turning on the flashlight, starting and stopping music, and more.  On the other hand, the Pebble application contains the gesture recognizer. Using the raw data provided by the device's accelerometer, we can learn custom gestures that the user desires and recognize it in the future. In this way, these gestures that the user sets can trigger action on the Android.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The largest hurdle was the data analysis. First, we considered a simplistic approach that sets phase offset constant but allows the speed of the gesture to vary. However, we discovered that this simplistic approach would cause massive uncertainty in the data analysis.   Thus, we moved to a more difficult approach of cross correlating of the gesture data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to create a very immersive tool for Pebble allowing users to use gestures to control features on the their smart phones.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned much about the Pebble SDK and the Android SDK.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ripple</h2>\n<p>Ultimately we would love to create this into an API allowing for gestures to be used to control items on iOS and Android applications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["grabItForMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KYsF4UjMCGw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grabItForMe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/434/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grabItForMe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/436/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grabItForMe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/433/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grabItForMe \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/432/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"grabItForMe \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/431/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Last week I needed to buy a new tube of toothpaste, but I didn\u2019t go to Ralph\u2019s as soon as I realize my toothpaste was running out (mostly because of laziness).

We both really enjoy the strategy behind card games, so we decided to clone crazy eights and add our own spin on it. By requiring players to answer a trivia question when playing cards, we added a skill component to the game, forcing winners to win through some skill, not just by luck of draw. </p>\n<h1>Mission Statement</h1>\n<p>Our goal is to create educational games that are balanced. This means that in order to win these games, there is more emphasis on player skill and experience. We aim to also bring education in our games, challenging users to solve problems by applying critical thinking skills in a fun environment. </p>\n<h1>Why We Built This</h1>\n<p>Both of us being relatively new to programming and computer science it was a game we could create, but has room to expand. Both of us understand the extreme importance of education, especially when younger. More time means more experience, which leads to higher competency and performance levels.</p>\n<h1>What's Next</h1>\n<p>In the future, we both want to expand this project to have more and better designed games. For our crazy eights project, we would like to add more categories of questions so it's not about just computer science, but about multi-disciplinary education. Another to-do would be creating a GUI for the game so it's more intuitive and navigable.</p>\n<p>Since it's just a command line game right now, porting it to and iOS or Andriod application would be high on the priority list. From there, we could integrate social media API's to make the games more accessible and social.</p>\n<p>Once our crazy eights application is well polished, creating an original game would be our highest priority. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">crazy-eights</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">uno</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BrWuGit/Quizley\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BrWuGit/Quizley\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Created ideas as well as leading our team of two.", "Helped Brian brainstorm ideas for the game and contributed functions to the code"]], ["Ibis", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ibis \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/846/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One day, one of our team members, Varun, was reading through an online news source.

With this experience, we became aware that all gaming came with a large limitation in how a user can interact with the content. Currently, such mediums are restricted to keyboard/mouse and console controller. For this idea, we where inspired by Tom Cruise's Minority Report, where the star is able to interact with the holographic displays in many interesting and exciting ways. So we decided to combine these two ideas, and came up with a first person shooter where the user uses hand gestures instead of mouse/keyboard.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We used the leap motion and Unity. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>It was pretty hard having the leap motion recognize consistently the custom gestures and movements we wanted the user to be able to use in the game. Also, Synchronizing things with Unity  was really really hard because we were unfamiliar with C Sharp and Unity has a real steep learning curve. This was our first time using Unity and it became quite clear that game development is meant to be a long, refined process.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of the effort and dedication of my team. While the final product is always important and exciting, what I appreciate the most is how everyone, even though they where barely keeping their eyes open, was trying desperately to do as much as possible for the sake of the team. It was a process where everyone supported each other and it really brought us closer as friends.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We need to plan out better what we want to do and segment work in a more efficient way so that there is not some overlapping components. Also, we learned a ton about Leap API, Unity 5, and generic game development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Leap Shooter</h2>\n<p>Make the game better and more polished so that we can actually release it as an app and have other people enjoy it too :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/michaelrzhang/Leap-Shooter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/michaelrzhang/Leap-Shooter\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["SlipperySocks", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Crunchy candies, grumbling ghosts, and slippery socks.

However, we found that using laptops was an inefficient way to learn how to cook; between sticky fingers and hard-to-follow recipes, we needed a hands-free, step-by-step way to follow along with recipes. Enter the Myo! With this exciting new technology, we would never have to worry about getting soup on our space bar or batter on our battery!</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The user inputs a recipe in a simplified form broken down into actions. Using algorithms we developed, the Myo recognizes and tracks these motions, counting and keeping track of the user's progress. When the user has completed a given step, the next step will be automatically shown. In this way, the user never has to touch the computer, and will not have to navigate unnecessarily long and complicated recipes. The My(o) Cookbook even conveniently provides a user with a direct link to tweet their cooking successes!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Going from idea to implementation, and working with the Myo using Javascript were two challenges that we ran into. It was also difficult to determine accurate means of calculating and recognizing movement.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the way that we were able to achieve a level of consistency and accuracy within such a short amount of time. In addition, we are proud of how we were able to simultaneously create an aesthetic UI to go along with the extensive back-end work.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was our first hardware hack, so we learned a lot about how the data from a piece of hardware works with code. Furthermore, we gained a lot more familiarity with Javascript and with web development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for My(o) Cookbook</h2>\n<p>We hope to further improve the accuracy of the motion tracking and to add a larger variety of actions to increase the versatility of the My(o) Cookbook. In addition, we want to create a library of pre-set recipes that users can browse and choose from.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/4ndygu/Myo-Cookbook\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/4ndygu/Myo-Cookbook\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["MixMi", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_LOIjtw3hX4?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MixMi \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/501/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MixMi \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/503/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MixMi \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/504/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MixMi \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/505/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MixMi \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/506/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MixMi \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/507/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Often times you find yourself experiencing things with a group of people, but no way to connect to them directly.

Buy groceries once, eat for a lifetime. Or more realistically, the expiration date on that 50 pound bag of broccoli we swore we would finish. Sadly, such a commitment eludes even the most dedicated of us as we cook whatever fancies our mind. Enter Recipr - where our big data platform (hosted by Linode!) draws from a source of over 1.5 million recipes to make sure that those greens don't go to waste. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Simply enter what you have, and how much of each item has been sitting around in your fridge, and we'll plan out your meals for you! </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Recipr has the ability to not only tell you what \"lemon, sugar, and water\" could make, but what and how many recipes you could make out of \"15 lemons, 20 cups of sugar, and 50 cups of water\" - something unmatched by over fifteen recipe-finder websites due to the problem being an NP-Complete optimization problem! Creating an algorithm that could compute this optimization a web-friendly time was a difficult obstacle the Recipr team faced. Further, designing a system to efficiently gather recipes from a database of over 1.5 million recipes was quite the worthy adversary</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Last year at LA Hacks, we managed to discover how to destroy the Pebble smartwatch via memory-leaks. Thus, with this project, we're most proud of doing something useful. On top of this, we solved a computationally difficult problem using a clever maximum-ratio relational strategy. This computational difficulty is masked behind our beautiful frontend and lightning-fast database transactions.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that Mongo is quick to setup, Flask is easy to use, and both Python and Javascript are really hard to debug. On top of this, we learned more about the wide variety of recipes available to the world and the beauty of services that provide the knowledge to us in a reliable manner. Mainly, as with all hackathons, we learned that working late hours is by far not the optimal strategy.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Recipr</h2>\n<p>Currently, the website thrives by allowing for quick interaction of cached resources; however, when things need to be cached, things get terribly slow. The next step for Recipr is an optimization-overhaul, where the  systems are sped up, code is cleaned, and all hackathon debug statements (ie 'poop1', 'poop2') are removed. Once this is done, we plan on adding even more detail to the recipes available to the end user and enhancing their experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jinja\">jinja</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://recipr.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://recipr.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>recipr.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed the front-end and developed REST API routes", "I designed and implemented the database schema, database population system, optimization algorithms.

By utilizing facial recognition technology, NokNok can determine if you are an authorized user, and allow you to enter your house - no need to fumble around with passcodes or remote controls.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>NokNok users simply go up to the front door and ring the doorbell, just as they normally would on any other door. NokNok's 5mp camera will then take a picture of the user and run it through a facial recognition software (API provided by Face++, via Mashape). If the user matches one in the \"approved\" database, the door sends a command to the SmartThings hub, instructing the included smart lock to activate.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was learning how to utilize the face recognition data from the Lambda Labs API and turn it into useful data for our software. The API outputs the data as JSON, a language we were initially unfamiliar with. In addition, we initially faced difficulty sending HTTP get requests using Unirest, an HTTP request client library. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of our app's combination of multiple APIs to provide a cohesive solution to an everyday problem. In addition, we are proud that we were able to utilize facial recognition technology, something that several years ago was only possible by governments and large corporations, to aid in our solution.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Through this hack, we gained a great deal of knowledge in how to utilize and parse JSON in order to obtain useful data for our app. One of our team members previously had no experience with Python, so this hack required him to pick up a new language in order to write programs for the Raspberry Pi. In addition, we learned a lot about how to insert APIs into our program, something we got to experience for the first time. Lastly, we learned about the mechanics of facial recognition technology, and how our API processes faces in order to provide a match.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NokNok</h2>\n<p>Our long-term goals are to improve the front-end user experience and providing more intuitive control to users via a mobile app. Through the app, users can be notified who is at the door, and they can choose whether or not they would like to answer it. They can also set up a vacation mode to remotely see who is ringing their doorbell, and choose to remotely grant visitors access if they so wish.\nIn addition, we would like to integrate with Facebook in order to utilize users' friends lists and recognize their friends' faces based on Facebook photos and profile pictures. This way, you can always know who is at the door, and can make a smart decision whether to answer or not.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mashape\">mashape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/smartthings\">smartthings</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">unirest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/face\">face++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rahul-io/NokNok.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rahul-io/NokNok.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["ParkAhead", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkAhead \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/608/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkAhead \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/611/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkAhead \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/613/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkAhead \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/618/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Finding parking has been a problem that bothers many residents in busy cities like Los Angeles. Happy days are being ruined by the frustrating hunt for parking. Gasoline is being wasted. According to Forbes, 3600 vehicle miles are driven each day in Westwood in search of parking. This is a problem looking for a solution.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>With nearly every car in the past 5 years shipping with Bluetooth and the Handsfree laws being enforced in many states, Bluetooth is becoming commonplace in vehicles. This is where ParkAhead beats the competition: while others are attempting to source data from cities, trying to put physical sensors on parking meters (or in the road!), or are relying an active user's input, ParkAhead takes advantage of a car's built in Bluetooth capabilities all in the background with little effort from the user.  When the car and the phone connect, ParkAhead recognizes that there is now an open spot. When the car and phone disconnect, our app recognizes that someone has now parked in the spot. </p>\n<p>With the parking data ParkAhead has, we can calculate the average parking time in neighborhoods, generate heat maps showing the most frequent spots, and create predictive models of a city's parking patterns without having to integrate with city data. For instance, ParkAhead's data can help users find restaurants that might not having parking now, but will have parking in 15 minutes. </p>\n<p>ParkAhead has an incredible potential to be monetized with extremely targeted and localized advertising network for restaurants and stores. When business owners have parking near a user, we can advertise their stores in the ParkAhead app, improving their customer's and future customers' experience.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The bluetooth events gave us the most trouble on the mobile app. Being able to detect Bluetooth in the background proved more difficult than we thought and had to be delegated to a background service that monitors all changes to Bluetooth devices in the area. On the database side, figuring out how to organize data in a reliable and consistent way was difficult. What should happen if someone's phone dies and they park? What should happen if someone's phone dies and they leave? We had to make decisions to keep the backend consistent. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were all amazed when the entire system finally connected. We were able to \"park\" in Pauley Pavillion and \"leave\" with the database and app consistently in sync. Furthermore, we were able to simulate this not just at the user's current location but any location around the world.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Multithreading services with Bluetooth in Android in the background. Google maps clustering. Many of us hadn't built a Node.js stack before. How to organize data in a database that can be inconsistent.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for ParkAhead</h2>\n<p>In order to succeed in the crowdsourcing space, ParkAhead need an iPhone app as well. Due to Apple relaxing on Bluetooth background restrictions in iOS 8, this app should now be feasible. We're really excited about the data that we are collecting since it can be used for so many purposes and for both profit and the collective good. The more we data we gather about parking, the more features we can add for our users, potential customers, city officials, and ordinary people who don't even use the app by improving infastructure. Parking predictions, targeted advertisements about parking, and opening the data to other services via an API will be rolling out in the future. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-fusion-tables\">google-fusion-tables</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-route-53\">amazon-route-53</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">restify</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/Edbertchan/parking/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/Edbertchan/parking/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/ayancey/lahacks_backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/ayancey/lahacks_backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/199iH0eQlWA3oc8BjoLt4XcfUWzR904iIgI8U-U5iGls/edit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/199iH0eQlWA3oc8BjoLt4XcfUWzR904iIgI8U-U5iGls/edit\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://api.parkahead.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://api.parkahead.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>api.parkahead.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the Android application that will transmit and communicate with the car via Bluetooth and send the information to the server.", "I worked on the Back-end in Node.js (thanks for teaching me, Jacob), and Python.

After playing around with a few ideas, we settled in our current idea which optimizes food based on both health and money, 2 factors important important to nearly everyone.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The user first enters the name of a restaurant close to the user's current location. After that the user enters the maximum amount of money he or she wishes to spend. Then the user selects the amount of calories desired, high, medium, or low. Once all of the inputs have been specified our algorithm runs which sorts all of the food items from the specified place based on the calories desired and the money specified. Our algorithm assigns each food item with a \"Nutritional Score\" that takes into account many nutritional facts and the user inputs. The suggested food items sorted by the Nutritional Score are displayed in a chart as well as a table.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>One challenge we had was incorporating a first time hacker into our team. However, by taking the time to show him what we had learned from previous hackathon projects, we both learned a great deal. Another challenge we faced was just fixing a lot of the bugs that started popping up. A lot of these bugs took a while to debug, but we were able to fix all of them by seeking help.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of finishing our app and having everyone contribute and learn while working on our hack. The user interface and our algorithm for sorting the food items in particular are parts of the hack that we spent a great deal of time on and are happy with the way they came out.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about web development since at most prior hackathons we had been creating mobile applications rather than web apps. We also were using Github a lot more effectively at this hackathon and thus were able to have everyone contribute more to the app.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Food4Less</h2>\n<p>We hope to next incorporate a social aspect to our app allowing users to share what they're eating. We're satisfied with our UI and algorithm, but we think we could also incorporate a few other charts to display additional data.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mashape\">mashape</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/harid001/food4less\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/harid001/food4less\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://food4less.azurewebsites.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://food4less.azurewebsites.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>food4less.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["RaView", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RaView \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/595/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"RaView \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/594/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Yelp is great for restaurants and AngiesList is great for services, but no one really excels at reviewing reviewing them altogether. We wanted to create one platform that reviewed everything from music and nightclubs to restaurants and services, in a similar fashion to what stackexchange did with question and answer topics for a variety of disciplines.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Simply pick one of the primary categories, i.e. \"food\" or \"gaming\", and you will be taken to a subdomain with tons of items from that category. With a built-in search and filtering feature, you can search for a particular topic of interest and get crowd-sourced rankings and reviews for a variety of items. For example, a simple search of \"Aloe Blacc\" in the \"Music\" subdomain would pull up a list of ratings and reviews of everything from albums to concerts, letting you know how good the most recent album was or how well a given artist puts on their live show.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>When building a crowd-sourcing application at a hackathon, you run into the challenge of generating initial content before receiving user reviews. We used a combination of sample content as well as rankings and reviews already posted online to populate our initial rankings, and we will shift this towards crowd-sourced reviews in the future.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>By building the entire application in a combination of Meteor and Angular (new platforms that we had to learn during the course of LAHacks), we were able to accomplish a lot of awesome things. Namely, because our system uses websockets to handle data transmission, we will be able to write hot code pushes as opposed to restarting our server every time we want to modify something in the future. Users will also notice the benefits of our websockets system when they post content, as their posts will update immediately on everyone else's browser when posted, even taking latency compensation into account. By taking the time to build a strong, fast, and scalable framework, we think we have established the basis for an amazing user experience.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We used two frameworks, Meteor and Angular, that were new to us before the hackathon began, so this obviously came with a learning curve. Furthermore, when trying to generate initial website content, we found out about many great review websites as well as great APIs like Mashape that helped us deliver more meaningful and actionable reviews of our items.</p>\n<h2>What's next for RaView</h2>\n<p>We need to gather sufficient crowd-sourced data to build out our review system so that it has momentum to be self-sustaining. This will require a blend of marketing and technological enhancement to support the ease of review submission.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/less\">less</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bday106/Raview\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bday106/Raview\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped build out the backend, which was challenging due to learning a new backend service.

If you're walking around in a new place, PebbleArea can tell you what interesting things are around you and it can give you a feel for what kind of a place you're in.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>PebbleArea first grabs GPS coordinates when it launches and then makes a HTTP request to the Google Places API with the latitude, longitude, and radius within which to scan. Google Places then sends over a JSON file containing a list of twenty \"most relevant\" places which range from Cafes and Bookstores to Dentists and Stadiums. More results are pulled recursively from the API. All of these places of interest are then sorted within the app into twelve standard categories (food, shopping, services, education) . Categories display next to their names on the main menu how many locations fall under themselves and those without any entries aren't shown at all in order to save space.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Navigating my way around web-based APIs for the first time and using JSON was a new experience for me. Figuring out how to sort each \"place type\" returned by Google Places into a category and filtering out all of the \"routes\" and \"mailboxes\" that it also returns was a fun challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Building my first app. Getting the asynchronous ajax and navigator (GPS) javascript code to work together.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I think I've really got the hang of JSON now and how to organize objects in arrays, and objects in arrays in other objects... in an array. With how Google Places formats its JSON files and how I wanted to organize my app, I ended up having to create a convoluted JSON-ish variable as a reference chart.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PebbleArea - Proximity information for Pebble</h2>\n<p>A lot of optimization. And then features to take advantage of more of the information that the Google Places API provides. More detailed pages for each location and maybe a compass that would point to a selected location? And then after a lot of polishing up, the Pebble app store.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/YangR13/PebbleArea\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/YangR13/PebbleArea\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["GoodasPhashion", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GoodasPhashion \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/472/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GoodasPhashion \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/473/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration: The inspiration behind this project was to create a system that would help promote the gap brand, while make it fun for users.</h2>\n<p>We love Gap products and have a passion to promote it. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Our website called GoodasPhasion which intrinsically motivates our users to vote and promote Gap Products.

One of the accomplishments that I'm proud of was being able to create a link for each individual user, and with this link, users can share on social media and whenever a user or friend visits that individual's link, the user will be redirected to the homepage and earn a point for the individual who referred them.

", "", "", ""]], ["Snowball", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>People nowadays value everything in social media, from pictures to music, based on the number of likes or upvotes they have. The goal of this project is to revolutionize the way people think by emphasizing how much one cares about a certain idea, rather than the number of likes it has. The best way to do this is by using the SnapChat method on information: put an expiration date, and people will pay attention to it more and live in the moment.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>This web application challenges the notion of using upvotes and likes as the primary way of quantifying the quality and popularity of information, and instead uses time and existence as a far better measurement of the quality of current trends in local communities and more. Essentially, instead of using likes / shares / upvotes for measuring the quality of information, users can choose to extend the life of a piece of information before it permanently deletes itself. Our rationale was that if people find a piece of information or trend particularly interesting or important, he or she will make sure it stays alive, rather than just giving it a simple like or share on another social network. Trends, ideas, and information can be ephemeral, and the goal of this app is to keep the most relevant information in the present, and only in the present. In a way, this is analogous to rolling a snowball to prevent it from melting: the posts are the snowballs, and \"rolling\" a post will extend its lifespan by a certain amount of time, thereby giving it a certain aura of importance. When an idea becomes irrelevant, time will \"melt away\" the snowball and the post will deleted, making way for newer trends and information that people find more relevant. </p>\n<p>TL;DR Existence and time are a new way of quantifying posts and statuses, and Snowball takes advantage of this by using self-deleting posts and options that extend the lives of posts.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Coming up with the idea was hard, and we weren't sure exactly what platform we wanted to use and if there were any Hackathon APIs that could help us. We eventually came up with the idea by wondering what would happen if Yik-Yak and Snapchat had a love child, and that's where the initial idea for Snowball came from. We found Meteor because one of our team members said it was a good web framework for beginners, and even though we hit some roadblocks like figuring out how to read and write into a Mongo database, we ended with all of the minimum functionality we wanted, and are looking towards the future.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Figuring out Meteor was difficult at first, but we ended up learning a lot about many different technologies. Having the \"Snowballs\" (what we call the posts) react immediately to the changes of passing time was something really cool to see. We can't wait to hear what other people think about what we did for this project.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use CSS and HTML5. CSS helped us animate the logo while HTML5 was where we wrote most of test code for the logo. We also learned how to use Meteor and its many packages, as well as test some stuff out with the Google Maps API. We're not sure if we can implement the last part in time, but it's worth a shot!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Snowball</h2>\n<p>We will continue developing the platform past the prototype stage if people like the idea. We're looking forward to hearing feedback from our hackathon peers and judges, and we hope that Snowball will become another popular medium of information for college students and others, especially if we decide to make it into a start up.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sweetalert</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jezhou/snowball\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jezhou/snowball\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did a lot of the full stack web development for this application.

When we saw the t-shirt cannon being controlled by an Xbox controller, we knew we had to get our hands on that cannon. It clicked in our heads that if an Xbox controller could control a t-shirt cannon, why couldn't  a Myo armband?</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>By binding Myo arm gestures with keys on the keyboard, the program that runs the Kinect T-shirt cannon recognizes the gestures as keyboard input (e.g. waving the hand to the right is binded to the right arrow key). When the keyboard input is read, the program will tell the cannon to rotate in the direction specified. One key switches the axis of motion from horizontal to vertical, and vice versa. This allows for less key bindings and less gestures to memorize. After moving to the desired angle, a fist gesture will fire the cannon.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The interaction between Kinect and the Myo arm band was not as responsive as anticipated. To counteract this, we reduced the speed of the cannon's rotation so that even when the cannon was unresponsive to the gestures, the cannon would not attempt to move beyond its boundaries. Another challenge was determining how to override the Xbox controller commands with the Myo band gestures. To overcome this, we skipped over the Xbox controller entirely and focused on binding the gestures to keys on the keyboard, allowing the Myo to communicate with the program.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Editing the Kinect Kannon's code to respond to a gesture which switched the axis of rotation was a significant accomplishment for our project. This allowed us to rotate left and right with the same gestures we used to rotate up and down. Another accomplishment was determining how each Xbox controller key event interacted with the cannon, so that we could replace the controller key events with our own key events.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned more about object-oriented programming in a way that is visual and interactive, how to integrate multiple API's into one project, and how hardware interacts with software to create a user experience. We also learned how to collaborate as a team, make use of provided resources and mentors, and how to take an existing idea and build upon it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MyoKannon</h2>\n<p>The Myo Kannon can be used at any event that the Kinect Kannon would be, but instead of having to use a clunky controller, the Myo Kannon becomes a hands-free extension of the user. Its uses could also come to include skyscraper window-washing, firefighting, and military applications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">windows-visual-studio-2013</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">phidget</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/zzmarkzz321/KinectKannon\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/zzmarkzz321/KinectKannon\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on pseudo coding the process for changing the axis of the cannon from horizontal to vertical and vice versa.

These features are then matched against features extracted from several pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger. These matches are then used to create a projection matrix from the reference image to the scene. We then analyze the projection matrix to establish a confidence in the match using a custom algorithm developed at LAHacks. If confidence is established, the prominence of the reference image in the scene is used to \"score\" the lifting capability of the scene. Notably, this algorithm doesn't actually solve the problem of determining a user's strength. It is, however, a fun and entertaining program to use with friends.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into performance problems from the start. As we began to tune the OpenCV functions and increase the performance, we added more reference images to match against. With these additional reference images, the potential for false positives increased dramatically. Another surprising difficulty we encountered was that several standard methods for estimating confidence, such as the relative difference of the point descriptors, were ineffective in this context. We developed a novel algorithm to reject false positives in response to this. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're proud of</h2>\n<p>The most interesting thing we accomplished at LAHacks was creating an effective and computationally efficient way to reject false positive matches. After previous methods failed, we explored a variety of heuristics and methods for reducing the noise. As we were looking for heuristics to reject noise, we looked at many things. What ended up being the most effective was examining the eigenvalues of the projection matrix. The eigenvalues were typically one large positive value, its negative and a small value, typically in the range of 0 to 1. We noticed that whenever we found a good match, this small eigenvalue was very close to 0.5. When a false positive is found, it typically varies wildly. We're still not exactly sure why this is the case, but it does function as a good heuristic.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We obviously learned a lot about computer vision, but we also learned the value of experimentation in solving and understanding technical problems. If we had approached the problem from a exclusively theoretical point of view, we never would have found the eigenvalue heuristic.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Project Lift</h2>\n<p>We'd really love to get this application on iOS and Android, but due to the computationally intensive nature of computer vision, we're not sure how successful that will be.</p>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["flickIt", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKCpp0m3a_Q?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"flickIt \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/331/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Wanted to have convenient phone to phone local transfer## Inspiration</p>\n<p>Works by connecting users via server to each other by location and then sending data through the internet## How it works</p>\n<p>setting up a server and connecting multiple clients at once## Challenges I ran into</p>\n<p>realtime adding and leaving of people## Accomplishments that I'm proud of</p>\n<p>how to develop wp8.1, node.js, ios, swift, mongodb, azure, tcpsockets, json## What I learned</p>\n<p>upgrade to support picture transfer## What's next for flickIt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wp8.1</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yangliming/flickIt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yangliming/flickIt\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Mobile Developer", "", "", ""]], ["KnowYourCommunity", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to do something to ease the moving process to a new place.

The technology created for the website was then expanded to the Splooshed for Chrome extension, that shows water consumption information for recipes on many of the top food-related websites in real-time.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran Into</h2>\n<p>The primary challenges we had were regarding getting enough data to suitable handle the majority of test cases. Often times, one or two food products would be unaccounted for in certain data sources. For instance, the USDA API was incapable of handling data regarding a particular kind of egg.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>Our group is particularly proud of the power of our recipe recognition engine in deciphering some particularly confusing and challenging combinations of quantities, units, and food types into machine readable formats that could be used to return water impact data.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>What we learned was the harsh but necessary truth that the water consumption by the agriculture industry is so exorbitant to the point that it is unbelievable. When discovering that one steak recipe required a combined total of over 10,000 gallons of water to produce, we were so shocked by the result that we went back and checked every individual item of food in the initial data sets only to eventually confirm the truth.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for Splooshed</h2>\n<p>There are a few things on the minds of the members of the Splooshed team. Among these are plans to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use OCR to overlay water usage data on restaurant menus</li>\n<li>scan food items by barcode</li>\n<li>give suggestions for replacement food items to compensate for removing high impact foods from your diet </li>\n<li>rate restaurants and food service businesses on how water-conscious their business practices are, particularly with regard to their menus</li>\n<li>integrate with food delivery services such as Spoonrocket for a more water-conscious fast food ecosystem</li>\n<li>continue to improve the accuracy of our back-end parsing technology</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.splooshed.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.splooshed.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.splooshed.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I almost entirely worked on front end design and development and created the extension interface for 3 out of the 7 supported cooking websites", "I put together the back end and also wrote the extension interface for some of the supported cooking websites.", "I worked on some front end details and finding APIS for use on the project.", "My job in this project was to do  research on agricultural water consumption, analyze the data and prepare them for Splooshed use."]], ["haxw.me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"haxw.me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/327/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"haxw.me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/326/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"haxw.me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/325/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"haxw.me \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/857/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>At LAHacks I didn't have a team when I arrived, and the team matching experience wasn't that good at all.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Hawx.me lets users sign up with their Github accounts, securely and seamlessly.

We borrowed a webcam from Intel, and got a lot of useful advice from them. We also wanted to use Wolfram's image/face recognition and language. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We have a webcam hooked up to an Intel Edison. It uses ffmpeg to capture a photo, which it then uploads it to Amazon Web Services using Node.js. We have a website that retrieves these images from Amazon S3 and displays them.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>The hardware kept breaking. The Edison came with a stripped version of Linux, so we had to install several packages to have a functional operating system. Even after that, we had to install things sort of manually because we did not have apt-get, yum, or pip functionality. We used edi-cam and ffmpeg to get the webcam to communicate with the Edison and could live stream after the first night, but the webcam stopped working the net day because of wifi issues. At one point, the Edison's kernel modules broke and we had to reflash the Edison and reinstall everything. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>We managed to get the hardware to work even after having to work backwards for several hours. Because of hardware troubles, we did not have enough time to implement our original ideas of motion sensing for music or facial recogniton. However, we managed to create a somewhat successful hack on hardware and software we had never used before.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The Edison is an external Linux machine, so we had to use puTTY and Linux to interact with it. We had to utilize many of the functions of the Linux system, including shell scripts, Vim, and using it as a server. We also learned about the hardware itself. We tried out several services and APIs that were confusing but very powerful.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>We have a website set up that uploads all the pictures taken with the EdisonCam. It can be a cheap way to take and upload photos from a set location without needing an actual computer and camera.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ffmpeg\">ffmpeg</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">s3cmd</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mikeli.me/lahacks.php\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mikeli.me/lahacks.php\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mikeli.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I researched resources and did a lot of the Linux command line stuff", "I did most of the backend work, programming the Edison to work with the webcam, upload the image to AWS S3, and display the images on my personal website.", ""]], ["putfoodin.me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"putfoodin.me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/356/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"putfoodin.me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/340/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"putfoodin.me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/341/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"putfoodin.me \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/166/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"putfoodin.me \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/239/164/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Putfoodin.me serves as a tool for college students to find local events where free food will be served. </p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>We initially started putfoodin.me as a social oriented application due to the fact that college students love free food and social interaction. There is no doubt when free food is offered at an event, it correlates with and generates high foot traffic, especially on a college campus. Students can search for these free food events on our website, as well as use our real-time voting system to allow them to see the popularity of an event.\n\nIn order to scale our application, we plan to expand our target audience from hungry college students to a non-profit organization aimed at helping people who are in need of food. Our business model essentially is a marketing platform that provides more direct foot traffic conversions. \n\nWe began development in a WAMP server, and soon moved it to Microsoft\u2019s Azure to allow for online hosting. We integrated Google Map\u2019s API into our application as well. This application was built using SQL, jQuery, Javascript, PHP, HTML, and CSS.\n\nAfter LA Hacks, we will be implementing more features such as Facebook integration to provide a safer and more credible community of users, expanding the user base, and continuing to pursue the application and building it into a startup.\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wamp</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://feedmefree.azurewebsites.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://feedmefree.azurewebsites.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>feedmefree.azurewebsites.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Number2", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Number2 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/242/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Number2 \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/241/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Number2 \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/240/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Number2 \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/239/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Number2 \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/238/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It was midnight in SLO and we were only about halfway to Fremont. We just stopped by to have some bbq sandwiches when it dawns on us: we need to pee. The question was where? Everywhere we looked, there were closed stores and corner food joints with nowhere to go. Miserably, we searched for the nearest Denny's, but no luck. Then we tried McDonald's--it was rather far. We ended up going to Taco Bell. Once we were back in the car and ready to go, we thought about how inconvenient it was to even find bathrooms so late at night. Admittedly, we were set on calling the app \"ShittySpots\", be we decided \"Number 2\" was the best name. After all, it's such a problem nowadays that (if done right) this app can in fact be the number 2 app. We decided it was worth a shot and went for it.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>It's basically a GoogleMaps-based app where there are points located around your location, found via GPS. Each point surrounding you is color-coded, and there's a button to show the legend. The points fall under one of seven categories: fast food, restaurants, supermarkets, hotels, schools/parks, and miscellaneous. There are buttons to add your own points and rate the current place you are selecting (which is still all under development). At the moment, the points are merely 17 points we search and manually added to a .txt file and parsed line-by-line, but we plan on using a sql-based database in the future, hosted on some server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We did not know how to even set up the temporarily free Linode server, and we couldn't figure out how to access the database via Java's sql library and a MySQL connector library we found online.

It allows you to create playlists of restaurants, dynamically selects an option based on user-set preferences, and lets you share your SporkLists with your friends. Built on cutting-edge technology, SporkList is <strong>lightweight</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong>, <strong>open-souce</strong>, and <strong>DRM-free</strong>, running on almost every <strong>web-enabled platform</strong>. We combine an <strong>intuitive drag-and-drop UI</strong> with <strong>Angular.js</strong>, <strong>jQuery</strong>, <strong>Parse</strong>, <strong>Google Places</strong>, <strong>Big Data</strong>, <strong>Cloud Computing</strong>, <strong>Parallelism</strong>, and <strong>Moore's Law</strong> together to create the ultimate and seamless connection between social media and social outings. We believe SporkList is the next level of <strong>disruptive technologies</strong>, extending internet technology and <strong>UX platforms</strong> into the <strong>real world</strong>, providing users with the <strong>Web 2.0</strong> experience even while offline. Some would even call this <strong>Web 2.1++</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SporkList?</h2>\n<p>In 2023, AppleAmazon-MicroFacebookGoogleSoft acquires SporkList and all its assets for $12.95 after bullying the owners into settling a lawsuit over the use of the internet to do creative things. The end.</p>\n<h2>A Brief Note</h2>\n<p>Our GitHub commit history apparently did not meet the community guidelines, so, unfortunately, we will not link it.

Eventually we started thinking, why do we enjoy music solely through our ears? Music can and should be an experience of the mind, so what if we tried to add more human senses to it rather than just hearing? That's when we found our answer in TouchMusic. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The TouchMusic glove is a wearable gadget that enables a music lover to physically experience their favorite songs. The glove does this by decoding a song's rhythm and melody to construct patterns to vibrate into the hand. These palpable patterns will match the audible music for a synergistic, pleasurable sensation. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The software component (written in Python) first decodes the song into different bands of frequencies. After analyzing the bands with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), it creates a sequence of vibrations that matches the song's rhythm and melody. The sequence of vibrations is then serialized and sent to the micro-controller for the glove.</p>\n<p>On the hardware side, an Arduino Mega drives nine iPhone 4 vibration motors and multiple LEDs are sewn into a cotton glove. In order to drive the motors, we built a custom shield compatible with the Arduino. The shield uses nine power transistors driven by pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals to adjust the vibration intensity of each motor on the fly. A 9V battery is attached to the hardware house to power the system.\nThe electronic component house is a 3D printed box that is connected by thin wires to the cotton glove. All components were carefully sewn in with conductive thread.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting everything to synchronize with the song we wanted was especially challenging, and more so the further down the chain we sent our data. It was especially challenging since the vibrational motors rely on PWM, so we had to write our own scheduler on the Arduino and fit that in with having to periodically receive new vibration patterns at the same time, all the while keeping in sync with the song.</li>\n<li>The vibration motors did not work with DC and we had to build our own custom shield.</li>\n<li>Initially, we were intending to use a smaller micro controller (the LilyPad Arduino) so that it would be on the glove and could all be sewn without wires but it broke. Then we had to change to the larger Arduino Mega, and 3D print our own electronics housing.</li>\n<li>We had to carefully plan where to sew each component with the conductive thread. We want to stress here that sewing was particularly difficult because we were using uninsulated conductive thread -- every mis-sew was not just an aesthetic mishap, but also a short circuit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully sew everything into a glove, attached it to our hardware components and integrated it with our music. It was also very rewarding re-creating our own music visualizer with digital signal processing. TouchMusic feels like a final product that we enjoyed building and using and that we think others would too. </p>\n<h2>What's next for TouchMusic</h2>\n<p>With more time, we can build a better prototype that is more robust and portable. We can enhance the motor capabilities and aesthetics. We can do research on what patterns are more pleasing to the human senses to enhance music even more. \nWe realistically see an opportunity for TouchMusic to make its way into the market as music enthusiasts are looking for new ways to transcend their listening experiences, and we believe TouchMusic does just that. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sewing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hardware-hack</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">soldering</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/linkenneth/feelbrations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/linkenneth/feelbrations\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Python, Arduino", "", "", ""]], ["Flower", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Flower \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/238/121/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Entire team kept bugging me about cats.

If there are no favorite bus stops in the home page, the user can add a bus stop to be a favorite. If he/she is within a certain distance from a favorite bus stop the pebble watch will show the user when the next bus will arrive. Please note the bus stop must be a favorite to have highter priority to be displayed on the pebble watch. </p>\n<p>From the developer's perspective, Pebble bus uses an Android mobile application, MySQL, and CloudPebble. The mobile application sends HTTP requests to the server that sends texts to receive the bus' schedule every 15 minutes. The server uses the Twilio API to send and receive text messages. The android application then parses the bus' schedule text message reply and stores it into a MySQL database. If the user is within range of a favorite bus stop, CloudPebble then runs SQL queries to obtain the necessary information to display the bus number, bus arrival time, and bus stop location. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We mostly ran into integration issues between the mobile app and server.

Shouldn't something change here?</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Language processing, machine learning, simplicity, cleverness.\nWhat separates Indigo from the few popular existing educational applications (eg Quizlet), is that Indigo is completely automated. Our clever algorithms parse your PDF textbooks, notes, and lecture slides; detect important terms (even without a glossary!), associate them with relevant information by conceptual linking, and create a seamless study experience. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Language processing problem with grammatical structure, detection algorithms; we had to deal with poorly formatted PDFs, OCR errors, and noisy text, all while ensuring we maintained the clean and intuitive interface necessary for this app to be usable.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Crafting a cohesive experience across all platforms. Bringing attention to this both cluttered and neglected market. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>The more we worked on this project the more we notice the severe lack of automation in competing existing products, and the more we realized how important it is that we pursue this idea.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Indigo</h2>\n<p>We believe that although there are a few players in the edTech market, developers in this field are on a large scale attached to archaic strategies and are not innovating on the necessary pace that is more possible today than ever. The few competitors that we've taken note of have either been bought out (eg Kno, by Intel $100M+ 2013) or simply do not have a powerful market presence (can you name 2 study apps?). \nWe plan to expand with potential features such as social integration including note sharing and open sourcing the study-guides platform so that students everywhere can benefit from computation and from eachother. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mashape\">mashape</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ibm</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Muse", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Muse \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/937/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Will and I are fans of all kinds of music, and while we share many of the same interests, there is still plenty of music that one of us may not know about that the other does. Our efforts to recommend music to each other have been unsuccessful for a couple of reasons. Since we don't happen use the same music subscription service, nor do we want to share large quantities of space-consuming music with each other, we end up texting songs or artists to check out, often in the form of YouTube links. This isn't ideal because of a natural tendency to judge the name of the song or the artist, and in some cases skip through the song at semi-regular intervals. We realized there had to be a better way to recommend music to each other, one that would allow us to recommend any type of music while being able to fully appreciate its worth. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Our solution involves using youtube-dl, an open-source, command-line program that lets users download video, and audio, from sites like YouTube and Soundcloud. Those two sites alone would afford us, and other users, no shortage of musical recommendations. The site allows users to create accounts, add each other as friends, and recommend music to each other effectively, which brings up the second issue we encountered. We realized that with less functionality, less control, users would be able to better appreciate and consider the music recommended to them. Specifically, there is no identifying information about the song displayed to the receiver, not the artists' name, title, or album cover. There is only the music itself to consider. Furthermore, users can only pause and play one song at a time, in order of which they were received, so they can't fast forward through it. The only other action they are able to take is to like or dislike a song, which may only be possible after a minimum amount of time of the song has passed. If a song is disliked, it is skipped completely and discarded. If a song is liked, then the information about the song is revealed and saved for later viewing. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest problem we encountered was with our initial choice of database, Postgresql. While I had some previous experience with mySQL, we were both still very inexperienced with that particular database management system. Even though our schema wasn't very complicated, our efforts in setting it up correctly were anything but. This occupied a great deal of our time and energy. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>After the Postgresql slump, we were reinvigorated when we reconsidered using MongoDB, which we initially thought wasn't ideally suited for the project. With Will redoing the database with MongoDB, I was compelled to start working on the front-end of the website, which was a lot of fun. Seeing us get back into this passion project with the requisite vigor was much welcomed by us both. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned that it is especially important to be prepared to work with new languages and APIs, and that it is sometimes best to stick with the tools you are more familiar with. Even if they don't seem like they're the best fit for the job, what really matters is your will to accomplish the job at hand.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Muse</h2>\n<p>While we weren't able to get a working product during LA Hacks, which is why we decided to leave before judging, we are committed to finishing this project as soon as possible. Once we make sure the backend is as solid as can be, we will start letting some of our friends and their friends use the service in order to get some initial feedback. After a good amount of beta testing, further development, and fine-tuning, we will incorporate our monetization plan, which will allow paying users to send unlimited recommendations to their friends. Through it all, though, the project will be completely open-source. Once we have put the site through  beta testing and implemented the monthly premium subscription option, we will open the site up to anyone who wants to discover new music and help their friends do the same.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/golang\">golang</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">youtube-dl</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/william-alexander/muse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/william-alexander/muse\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on the front-end of the website, making it look aesthetically pleasing while not hindering the functionality.

After selecting their payment method, the user can finish the payment and seamlessly pay their check.

It's time for a change! With What's Your Number? you get to ask for people's numbers in a fun, creative way. The other person will get blown away by the uniqueness and ultimately think of you as a super cool person :)</p>\n<p>How it works\nInput your phone number in the key pad on the shirt. Watch in the LCD Display the numbers to make sure you're typing correctly. Then press the checkmark/submit button. Your number will be texted to the person wearing the shirt, and the person wearing the shirt's number will be texted to you.

Everything works, and the aesthetics aren't bad either--we customized the background color of the LCD Display and used what we had (masking tape and accurate fingers to tear with) to make neat keys.</p>\n<p>What I learned\nWe learned how to integrate Mashape's APIs, embedded Linux, and about the Edison.

"<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>For this project, we wanted to bring peer to peer technology akin to BitTorrent into a game. P2P is run entirely on the processing power of clients. There is no central server which commands everyone around, but rather a network of peers.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Each client playing the game helps process physics and collisions. It works by an voting system: three clients will process a certain call, and a fourth will choose the median result. This way, hackers cannot take over the system unless they control all clients. </p>\n<p>By having no dedicated server hosting the game, we can offload a lot of pressure. The game can scale way bigger, and when more players connect, there is more power available for the game.</p>\n<p>For the sake of the demo, we created a small tank game. Players can move around and shoot others.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into / Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>There were a bunch of optimizations that we needed to write in order to get peer to peer networking. We used WebRTC, a framework that allows javascript clients to talk directly to each other. Rather than making calls to a server, clients instead make calls to other clients, which then use the voting-system to find the next point.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>In this project, I learned how torrents work and are structured.

As such, we thought that the world was lacking a hub where one could find quick, easy, useful info about travelling between countries. Thus, TravelPixie was born.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We used Node.js to create the server, and used JavaScript to scrape data from websites, and use various API's to get JSON/XML data about flights, time zones, currency, weather, and other useful info about cities. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we were going to use a Django server, and so we would be able to code with Python, which we are all more comfortable with. However, due to unforseen circumstances, we had to use a Node server instead. Thus, we were forced to use JavaScript, a language none of us had used much in the past. Scraping data thus became much more difficult.</p>\n<p>Moreover, we came across various API's with great data. However, either they cost too much money ($3000), or they had extraneous requests that we couldn't satisfy. Thus, we had to come up with new methods and manners to find useful data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Before this project, I had little experience with JavaScript, and no experience with servers and JSON/XML data.

The low-income citizens, who lack proper health education, make poor decisions when they choose which food to eat, making those people prone to diabetes and obesity. We thought that it was necessary for everyone to have access to a convenient application that helps them understand how our body works. Therefore, we have decided to create an application that calculates an individual's metabolism rate and that contains more than 8000 food ingredients and food types to calculate how much a person can consume after every meal. Thus, the user can make healthier decisions to prevent obesity and diabetes.</p>\n<h2>How it works:</h2>\n<p>Our application first measures the user's body mass index and metabolism rate by gathering the user's height, weight, age, and gender. After the user inputs all the necessary data and calculates the BMI and metabolism rate, the application saves the individual's data into the application. After doing so, the user can keep track of how much calorie he has consumed by searching the type of food he or she ate during any time of the day in the application. Then, the application will automatically deduct the amount of calories from his or her metabolism rate, allowing the user to keep track of how much more calories he or she can consume. Also, the application has a 24 hour reset window since the metabolism rate is renewed every day. If the user consumed less than the metabolism rate, the user will lose body fat, as if the user eats beyond the metabolism rate, the user will gain fat. By having this in mind, the users can easily check how much food they can eat to either lose weight or gain weight.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into:</h2>\n<p>Even though we had a clear goal in this project, we suddenly had an impulse to take the application to a new level. We thought that we could possibly add a new feature where the application maximizes nutrient within a given budget. At first, it seemed like we were able to code without any problem, but we realized that it is very complicated to maximize every nutrient within a given budget. Also, we thought of using geo-tagging feature to allow users to find restaurants around them and save the local restaurant's menus and calories on our database, but we faced great technical difficulties, making us give up on this plan.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of:</h2>\n<p>Even though we ran out of time due to the failure of our application's expansion version, we managed to create an application that helps individuals make more healthier decisions when they choose food. We really hope that people learn to make healthier choices by using our application in the future.</p>\n<h2>What we learned:</h2>\n<p>We learned that it is very difficult to make a functioning application within a restricted time. However, we put ourselves together to finish tasks towards the end and eventually finished making the application. Also, we learned to make applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PhoneGap. </p>\n<h2>What's next for HealthiNBudget:</h2>\n<p>We hope to make an expansion set for this application so that the individuals can not only see the calorie progress but also keep track of necessary nutrients, such as protein and vitamins. Also, we hope to install the maximizing feature to our application because then individual users can easily find which food to eat within their budget limit and to find foods that contain the required nutrition.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phonegap\">phonegap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alsbtain/HealthiNBudget\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alsbtain/HealthiNBudget\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Pebblic Speaking", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebblic Speaking \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/788/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebblic Speaking \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/787/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebblic Speaking \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/790/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebblic Speaking \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/792/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebblic Speaking \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/794/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebblic Speaking \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/796/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pebblic Speaking \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/237/798/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Remember that feeling you would get whenever you were forced to present in front of an audience?

And in that situation, your phone is on 2G data and you can't connect to your email. But no worries, Parsly solves this issue, by allowing its users to retrieve important email data with only 1 bar of 2G data. </p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Parsly's backend is powered by and designed around the <b>Context.io API</b> (for it's ability to retrieve and parse emails). We have an Apache and PHP web server and website hosted by <b>Linode</b> running in the background, waiting for commands send from your phone. The website also has features which allow you to easily unsubscribe to mailing lists, or access details of your future events. We accomplish these features by filtering emails by tags such as unsubscribe, eventbrite, and itinerary. </p>\n<p>While everyday life occurs, the PHP server in the background constantly polls for any text messages from your phone number. And if it detects a valid command such as 'amazon' or 'itinerary' it will parse through your emails and send you the details that you want see. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The most time consuming challenges we ran into involved setting up the mail server for our services hosted on Linode. And multiple problems with spotty wifi, which prolonged our development time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We take pride in creating an application that provides an enjoyable net experience even if the user has dial-up speeds.

People living in modern countries can go online whenever they want and access content to learn to their hearts content. However, there are over 4 billion people in the world without access to internet who want desperately to learn to make their lives better but aren't able to.</p>\n<h2>What is TellALecture2Me?</h2>\n<p>While billions of people lack internet, in comparison very few people around the world are without telephone access. TellALecture2Me lets people call in to numbers around the world. Callers then go through an interactive voice response system, which helps to search through a huge library of online audio learning resources. We then serve up that audio to them through the phone.</p>\n<p>In addition to providing resources, the TellALecture2Me website also provides real time data on who is learning what, and when. We want to put data into the hands of government and education institutions in impoverished nations to improve their own education systems and gain insight into what people are interested in learning more about.</p>\n<h2>Challenges and Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>Ultimately a big technical challenge for us was getting the backend service with IVR working as well as we'd like. Being part of the smartphone and computer age, it was frustrating to deal with interaction using only the number digits. Also because neither of us come from a strong front end backend, building out real time charts and maps that served meaningful data was also a difficult task.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TellALecture2Me</h2>\n<p>We want to expand on our library of resources and add the engineering work to be able to support not only audio lectures from our library but being able to search through audio, video and literature resources from other websites which we would then process and serve up. We are also interested in adding more features to our interactive voice response system which would include being able to skip/go back/pause and otherwise navigate through the audio.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mobile</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nginx\">nginx</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bower\">bower</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://tellalecture2.me/static/pages/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tellalecture2.me/static/pages/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tellalecture2.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://gentle-tor-1463.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gentle-tor-1463.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gentle-tor-1463.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Concert Crowd", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>As avid concert goers, we run into everyday problems such as finding a group to go last minute with.

Due to this, students who waitlist for classes during registration do not have an accurate measure of how likely they will be able to get into the class. To help students with this dilemma, we created a chrome extension that shows the maximum number of seats in the classroom alongside the number of seats the department currently allows for each course.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>We used a webcrawler to gather information from our school website to create a database of classroom capacities. This data was converted into a key value pair lookup table for use in the chrome extension. It uses javascript to scan the webpage to retrieve the classroom names and display the corresponding classroom capacities.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We came into the competition with no previous experience making chrome extensions. It was most difficult to create a tooltip displaying the true classroom capacities on each hover.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We created a tool that is useful to our entire student body as well as us. We plan to make this tool open source and share it with the rest of our peers so that they can benefit from our work. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to work with the chrome extension API.
