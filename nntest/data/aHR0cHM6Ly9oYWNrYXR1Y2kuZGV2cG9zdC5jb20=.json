Are you at your happiest when you're away from home? Now you can find out. Sometimes when you're in a dark place, it's hard to remember that it was ever any different. This chrome webapp helps you track the ups and downs of your mood over months and tracking many factors that might affect your mood to help you figure out what affects you.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It prompts the user every day to input their current mood, and simultaneously accesses local weather, distance from home, and other factors so that the user can see how their mood tracks over time, and also what other factors it tends to correlate with.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Javascript for most of the inner code, HTML/CSS and Jquery for the web aspects, JSON for the local storage, the Openweathermap api for weather stats, GeoLocation for getting current location, D3 for graphical data representation and Google Maps for address location.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>None of us had ever made a Chrome webapp before, so it was a challenge even getting started. In addition, it was our team's first Hackathon, so none of us knew exactly what to expect, or how to work together. A couple of our members also had trouble getting accustomed to Git for version control, which lead to some lengthy merging sessions. We also failed to discuss coding style or standards before starting, so our code ended up as a fragmented mess, and had to be refactored several times.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The UI looks pretty sharp, and figuring out how to make all the dispirite APIs work in concert was quite a feat in-and-of itself. The graphs could also be a very interesting thing to examine once the app has been running on a user's machine for a few months.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Organize more, talk more, always have a clear vision before you start coding, and always have fun!</p>\n<h2>What's next for MoodGraffr</h2>\n<p>After its showstopping debut on the floor of HackUCI2017, one of the original team members actually installed it on his own machine.

We wanted to create an extension that shows information about random things based on categories. We saw that the quirky quotes from Wikiquotes can be a pleasant read and aesthetic on our user\u2019s screen, and decided to start our project under the name \u201cenlighten.your.day\u201d.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our Chrome extension allows users to \u201cenlighten their day\u201d with quirky quotes. This page is accessible by opening a new tab in a Google Chrome desktop browser. On the main page, users can select a category that they would like to be enlightened about. Quotes are then randomly spawned for the users to read. In addition, users have the ability to switch categories after reading a quote and change the background color of the page using the side navigation bar on the main page.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We took advantage of Google Chrome\u2019s Extensions feature which allows us to write Chrome extensions using popular web languages. We used HTML and CSS to conceive the look and feel of our New Tab Chrome extension, while we used Javascript and jQuery to make ajax requests to the Wikiquotes server and get/display quotes. Taking advantage of Chrome Extensions\u2019 local storage feature, we were able to save user settings that included category and background color selection.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the unexpected challenges we faced was writing and execute Javascript code in accordance with Google Chrome\u2019s Content Security Policy (CSP) feature. Specifically, Javascript code could not be executed as inline scripts in HTML files. After consulting with the HackUCI Mentors, we decided to utilize a workaround where we called Javascript code located in dedicated Javascript files. We also used a method where we \u201clistened\u201d to input from the mouse to allow the sidebar and sandwich button to work correctly.</p>\n<p>Another challenge that surprised us was the lack of available APIs that could generate random facts about categories of our choosing. In fact, the only API that we found that was suitable for our extension was the Wikiquotes API conceived by Nate Tyler. This API provided some great quotes from Wikiquotes, but it did not provide an author and allow us to use shorter quotes easily. The result is that some of our presented quotes sometimes did not make sense. Thankfully, the API was able to perform beyond our expectations with its ability to even pull quotes from the large database that is Wikiquotes.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>As a team, we are proud that we completed our project and created our very first Chrome Extension. As this was our first hackathon and our first project together, we were very pleased that we were able to create our very first program. In broader terms, we learned how to create our own webpage from scratch together, using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery to our advantage. Overall, we are satisfied with our extension and will definitely share it with family and friends.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>In general, we learned a lot about web development and how really small details can actually require more work than it looks. Specifically, loading a random quote took a lot more lines of code and analysis of APIs than we anticipated. We learned about the power of APIs and its ability for us to perform things we could not do without those services, such as searching up random quotes.</p>\n<p>We also learned how to write code according to specifications other than our own; Google Chrome\u2019s CSP forced us to learn about its security features and rethink our code without violating its security measures. </p>\n<h2>What's next for enlighten.your.day</h2>\n<p>Possible improvements include finding a new API to include authors for the quotes that are provided, providing images as possible background selections, and improving the rate at which quotes are spawned. While the speed at which quotes appeared was fast, it was sometimes inconsistent. Our next update will aim to improve this. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/arthurtham/enlighten.your.day\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/arthurtham/enlighten.your.day\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["StudBud", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StudBud \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/767/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Find Courses</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StudBud \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/768/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>About Us</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"StudBud \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/458/769/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Home</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>StudBud <img data-canonical-url=\"https://github.com/wonjoolee95/StudBud/blob/master/img/logoBig.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--DFvt7BKk--/https://github.com/wonjoolee95/StudBud/blob/master/img/logoBig.png\"/></h1>\n<h3>StudBud is hosted <a href=\"http://studbud.x10host.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here at studbud.x10host.com</a>.</h3>\n<hr/>\n<p>\"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.\" - Albert Einstein</p>\n<p>The best way to learn is to teach, and there is no better way than to teach your fellow Anteaters.

We believed we could use technology to replace the need for pens, papers, electronic buzzers, and maybe even hostesses.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The application essentially allows the user to walk up to a kiosk, scan the restaurant's unique code, and automatically be added to the restaurant queue. From there, they will be notified of information such as their queue position and their estimated wait time. They will also receive a notification when their table is ready.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our project is composed of two applications, one for the client and one for the kiosk, using Android Studio. In order to create the connection between the client and the kiosk, we used QR codes. The information extracted from the QR codes are then sent to the server, which was built using node.js and mongodb.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many of the challenges we ran into were generally smaller because we broke the whole project down into many manageable tasks. This meant that our team would help each other solve the issues as they arose. With that being said, one of the toughest challenges we had to face was trying to embed a QR code scanner into our client side app - something that was crucial to the success of this project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The accomplishment that we are most proud of was seeing the way the kiosk looked when it was all set up, being able to scan the QR code, and having our names pop up on the kiosk in the queue.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned many different things throughout this hackathon; however, the most valuable lesson we learned was that pacing ourselves throughout the event resulted in a much better experience in comparison to our experience at last year's HackUCI when we wanted to finish the project before getting any rest. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Ease</h2>\n<p>If our group decides to continue working on Ease, there are many other features we could add to the app. We could implement an AI that can interpret statistics to give extremely accurate table seating estimates. Furthermore, we could allow restaurants to customize the options offered on their kiosks, such as seating options like tables, bars, booths. Lastly, another feature to add to the app would be to allow customers to save their meal preferences and automatically order their meals just by scanning with their phone. An example of this would be a customer walking into Chipotle, scanning Chipotle's kiosk, selecting their \"Healthy Burrito\", and having all their preferences automatically sent to the cashier.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Entropy (download on itch.io link down below)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to visually capture and render the hectic experience of modern college life to truly understand the depths of a student's mind.

Then that led to the idea of building on top of the idea of Yelp with the focus of where your friends have been and recommend. Somewhere down along the line was the idea of collections of places instead of individual places. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We see Beacon as an exchange of ideas with your friends and the world.\nBeacon adds a new dimension to exploring new and exciting places. Start by creating a list of places you will visit on your trip to Las Vegas. You feel like you need some help planning where to go so you invite your friends to collaborate on the list. To get more ideas on other places, you could search for other lists people have made. Gradually, your list grows and you are ready to go on your trip with confidence. </p>\n<p>Above is one of many ways to use Beacon. The customizable, collaborative lists of places can serve as an itinerary for your family vacation, a pool of the top boba places in your area by boba enthusiasts, or a bucket list for you and your friends to check off.

I also wanted to use this happyfuntimes library for a long while.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Its a simple game where you connect with your phone and are spawned in as a random animal. Each animal can move in any direction, has a special move when you tap the screen, and has an objective goal which yields points (I didn't finish the scoring part really). For example birds are supposed to try to eat small critters, rabbits are supposed to just stay alive, snakes try to kill bears, etc.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I made the game using the Unity Game Engine with C#, as well as the happyfuntimes library to communicate with phones over wifi as controllers</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As usual I was a little too ambitious with my idea, but I got a decent working version going and some great experience with the library (its left a good impression on me!). Also I went home and slept once during the competition, but I kinda ran out of steam here at the last couple hours sadly haha!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Even thought the art is pretty bad at least its consistent, which makes it look slightly more pleasing. I'm also proud of the custom controller layout I wrote for the happyfuntimes library. I made it very efficient, so hopefully can use it with many concurrent players for this game and other games in the future.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned more about javascript, html, and css, when I was making the custom controller which was pretty fun. It kind of bothers me how much different css stuff there is though, seems like theres like 500 different ways to do the same thing.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Wildlife Simulator</h2>\n<p>I'm definitely going to work on it more and add some more animals, as well as finish the scoring system. I would also like to go through and rewrite parts of the html and add more UI elements to the phone portion of the game, like a healthbar for example.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">happyfuntimes</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/buckslice/wildlife_simulator\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/buckslice/wildlife_simulator\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Tutor Database", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When I started studying in UCI as a Computer Science major, I was able to learn so many things about coding and the possibilities that come with it. As a freshman, all of the things that people could do fascinated me, and wanting to experience that firsthand is what lead me into volunteering for the hackathon. Here, after my 11 PM to 3 AM, I was allowed to stay and participate, so as I looked at the categories for judging, I had the drive to make something educational. </p>\n<p>For about two years, I worked as a private tutor for high school students in Irvine. I got a decent amount of clients, and I used to just record hours on an Excel spreadsheet.  However, I thought about how there could be some program or website that could make recording information not only easier, but more organized as well. Unfortunately, since I didn't have a team for the hackathon, I was severely limited by my own personal skill and experience, so I decided to make a simple program. Using this program, private tutors can be more informed about the clients they have, and they can keep track of who they're tutoring and when they tutored a particular client. Since this is my first hackathon, I wanted to make something that would apply to my personal interests while also adhering to the categories at hand. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The program is essentially a user-based interface with the private tutor as the user. After connecting to an old or new database with a set structure of tables, the user can add and remove information about clients (called \"Tutorees\"), from ways to contact the client to the schools that they go to. The user can also add, update, and remove records, which is a log of the dates and times of when a client had been tutored along with whether the client has paid it yet. The user is able to see the information in an organized fashion, and whenever the user is done, he or she can close the program and be ensured that the database has been updated with all of the information. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The only programming knowledge I had was a high school AP class and one quarter of Python teaching, so I decided to use Python as the main language for the program. I mainly used the sqlite3 module that comes in the standard library of Python 3.6, meaning I also spent a lot of time understanding and using SQL syntax. The program is made using mainly functions, and the program was made with the idea that a single individual is the one using the program at a time, hence the locality of the database. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As I have iterated before, this is my first hackathon, so the whole process of figuring out what to make and deciding how to do was a challenge in itself. I struggled with envisioning how certain methods would work along with which actions a user could potentially do while using this program. With a lack of teammates, all of the coding had to come from me, so I had only myself to fix and make the multitude of problems I ran into while coding. I also had to learn how to read the Python Standard Library to figure out the things I especially wanted, which was new to me. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of everything I have done. While it may not have been as sophisticated and developed as other programs, the project itself was solely driven by me alone, and I feel happy with the product and the whole journey it took to get there. I was also blessed with the opportunity to participate because I chose to volunteer, so I am proud of the things I could do to help people during the hackathon (mainly by picking up trash) and the hurdles I overcame afterwards by participating. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I personally learned so much from this hackathon. I learned not only how much work it takes into organizing the event, but also how much work it takes to create something from start to finish in less than 36 hours. I have a lot more experience in SQL while also understanding Python more than I did before, and I also got the knowledge of what others could do while working and coding together. I hope that when I get the opportunity of future hackathons, I can learn more about the team aspect of coding.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tutor Database</h2>\n<p>While I would personally use this program for my own uses in the future since I still tutor other students, I think that if I were to develop this program with more experience, I would make this Tutor Database a lot more accessible to others. With a development of a website or app, I envision the project to grow into a way for tutors and clients to get connected, and the use of databases for tutors particularly could help many different groups benefit from the information in some way; governments and schools could have databases of what students need help in improving based on what subjects , while tutors and tutorees alike can find the people they want to connect to. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/appleengi/tutor-database.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/appleengi/tutor-database.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did everything, from the thought process to the development of the whole program with Python."]], ["LectureHall", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAbvZ9HN57g?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/337/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Main web interface for professors.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/355/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Login page for Student app.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/336/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>More web interface with realtime charts. </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/339/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Professor interface with question asking capability.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/352/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Class details page for question asking and evaluation.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/354/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Student app class views.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/351/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Student app class adding.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LectureHall \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/353/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Student app class enrollment.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As students, we've been in classes, especially large ones, where the professors have had a hard time gauging student's comfortability and managing the entire lecture. We figured a tool that allows professors to gauge where a class is in realtime would solve this problem. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>LectureHall allows students to post in realtime how their understanding of the subject currently being taught is. These results are aggregated from all students enrolled and are shown to the professor. In addition, LectureHall manages the lecture by allowing the professor to push questions to all students, allowing students to ask questions to the professor and allowing students to check into the class for attendance. Finally, all of this student data is displayed beautifully in a graph-based web interface for the professor to see. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>LectureHall was built for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and the web with the Ionic 2 framework. Our database is a Firebase realtime database which gives it the power to scale to every lecture hall in the world. We built this platform over 36 hours at the UCI Hackathon mainly developing in Javascript. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The network at the Hackathon made testing realtime integration and data synching very difficult since the bandwidth required wasn't there. The Ionic 2 framework is a fairly new version of the Ionic framework. To challenge ourselves and learn the newly updated framework, we decided to develop using Ionic 2 rather than Ionic 1. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud of our realtime data visualizations. On our platform, someone across the world can wirelessly adjust a value with our app, and our data visuals, line graphs, bar charts, and more adjust while values are being updated in realtime, instantly. We're incredibly proud of how fast and fluent our visualizations show what is happening in realtime. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Typescript, a variant on Javascript.\nHow to work in Native Javascript.\nCharts.js, a JS library for charts.\nThe Ionic 2 framework for multiplatform apps. \nRealtime data synching through the Firebase database. </p>\n<h2>What's next for LectureHall</h2>\n<p>One of our group members, Tim Johnson, is a TA and we plan to continue beta-testing this program in his discussion sessions with over 100 students for CS 162 at UCI. We hope to bring LectureHall to a point where it can be demonstrated to UCI faculty and administration for adoption into UCI classrooms. If all goes well, we plan to develop, market, and eventually sell our platform to campuses around the world and establish LectureHall.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript\">typescript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xiaofanwu/hackUCI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/xiaofanwu/hackUCI\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["GoMeet", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The idea of meetup.com was the start and from there we realized in this day and age it is possible to create a much more spontaneous way to meet new people. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app allows you to broadcast your location to other nearby users and meet up with them.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>This was built in Android Studio.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Dealing with inconsistant location services. </p>\n<h2>What's next for GoMeet</h2>\n<p>Adding suggestions as well as a safety rating on your current location.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tacalvin/HackUCI_Project\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tacalvin/HackUCI_Project\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["hackuci", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"hackuci \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/385/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Screenshot of successful lesson 1</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Hack@UCI 2017 Project -

Once the slide title and text are pasted into the box, a slide appears; at the top is the title. On the left, four relevant images appear (all of which can be copied and pasted to the student's choice of presentation software). On the right, bullet points with relevant words are shown; each bullet point corresponds with a sentence from the text, so the longer the text, the more bullets will be generated.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For the text generation, we used the Google Cloud Natural Language API to parse sentences into keywords and word types which were converted to a JSON file. We parsed the file so that the most important words would be printed out as bullets and displayed onto the slide.</p>\n<p>Images were generated by using the Flickr Photosearch API to search for images by tag, which returned the JSON file containing the id's of the photos. We used PHP to extract the id's and stored them into an array, as well as to convert each id into a URL. Using a foreach loop, we displayed 4 images which were resized and cropped using CSS to create a 2x2 grid of square photos.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting the Google API to work<br/></li>\n<li>Parsing the JSON file<br/></li>\n<li>Formatting the output so that four images would appear on the left and new bullets created on the right for each sentence in the text.</li>\n<li>Bullets sometimes did not make grammatical sense</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>HackUCI is the first hackathon for half the members on our team, and we were all able to contribute in some way to create a working product!<br/></li>\n<li>All of us learned a new programming language (came in with no backend experience)</li>\n<li>Utilizing Google's Natural Language API to generate the most salient words from large amounts of text</li>\n<li>Integrating Flickr's API into our PHP code</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Cloud Natural Language API<br/></li>\n<li>Flickr Photosearch API<br/></li>\n<li>Integrating backend and frontend<br/></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Succinct</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a next button that keeps the original slides but refreshes the form to generate a new slide<br/></li>\n<li>Exporting slides into a pdf that can be downloaded<br/></li>\n<li>Dynamic slides (slideshow view)<br/></li>\n<li>Presentation view- make the presentation directly from the website<br/></li>\n<li>Editing images and bullets in the output<br/></li>\n<li>Improve algorithm for parsing through outputted JSON file to generate  grammatically correct bullets<br/></li>\n<li>Bibliography generator</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-cloud-natural-language-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">flickr-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I primarily worked with our backend team to integrate the Flickr API into our PHP source code by parsing the JSON files and running it through a loop to  display the photos.

The day of the hackathon, Saikiran and Ravi went out to purchase one over craigslist. It was filthy and still wet from the rain, but it cost only 75 dollars for a fully functioning unit. The cameras and electric components were things we either already owned, or were able to get at the shop. In the time that it normally took me to </p>\n<h2>Turning Trash Into Treasure</h2>\n<p>To build the car we used a motor from a car window and connected to the linkage that controlled the steering. We used the motors already in the car for the throttle. To power the car we also use the battery included in the car, it was 12v which was the voltage of most of our components. To do control on the car we used an arduino and Jaguar motor controller as well as a 10 amp relay. We communicated with laptop over the arduino\u2019s serial port.</p>\n<h2>Numerous Features. One interface.</h2>\n<p>Self driving vehicles are not based on a single device or algorithm. They are an amalgamation of solutions, each of which works to interpret some information, or make decisions regarding it. These solutions are built up over time, and connected together.\nIn our case we used the ROS framework to tie together all of the sensing, processing, and control in an organized manner.\nThe car needed first to sense the environment. In the interest of saving money we skipped on multi thousand dollar LIDARs and RADARs, and used Microsoft Kinects that Aleksandr already had available. These cost around $25.00 depending on where you buy them. The Kinect is a particularly interesting camera because it was the first cheap implementation of the RGB-D format for cameras. While Microsoft had used it for entertainment purposes, the hobbyist robotics community had found use in the extra channel of salient and easily interpretable data for computer vision.\nIn our case we use it for two purposes. The first is to detect obstacles in front</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ros</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jaguar</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">woodscrew</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ThaHypnotoad/SelfDrivingCar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ThaHypnotoad/SelfDrivingCar\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Let's go", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Let's go \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/297/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Search!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Let's go \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/302/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Swipe!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Let's go \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/321/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Pick!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Let's go \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/322/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Go!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When multiple people meet up and don't know where to go to eat.

Particularly on the food tab.</p>\n<p>In the future, we plan on integrating a social walking service to track anteater walking patterns at UCI. Using the resulting data, we can create more efficient walking routes.</p>\n<p>We also plan on parsing food nutritional data more carefully, vs the current \"sweeping\" tactic for basic information. We will, of course, make this information easily accessible.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we plan to integrate the events tab with UCI's EEE calander for pulling courses.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we plan on using a basic machine learning algorithm to provide users with UCI news that is considered potentially interesting to them based on events they attend, courses they take, and places they frequent.</p>\n<p>In terms of the API, we plan on increasing it's robustness and providing XML output by request. Additionally, optimizations to the searching algorithms for the <code>HTMLReferenceTree</code> class should be implemented.</p>\n<h2>TODOs</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Write a better self test for UCI_DATA_API</li>\n<li>Something with events page? Ability to add events at least?</li>\n<li>Prevent \"over scrolling\"</li>\n<li>Clean up some of the gui prototyping code</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n<p>Simply import the <code>UCI_DATA_API.py</code> module into the module you intend to use the API.</p>\n<p>For lightweight, HTML parsing, implement the <code>OneHack_HTML_Parser.py</code> module.</p>\n<h2>Usage (APP)</h2>\n<p>Simply run the <code>main.py</code> module.</p>\n<h2>Usage (API)</h2>\n<p>To use the module, start by creating either a <code>FoodDataManager</code> or <code>ClassDataManager</code> class.</p>\n<p>Each of these classes supports the same standard sequence of events:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Construct an instance</li>\n<li>Designate an html source with <code>UCI_DATA_API.set_html_target()</code></li>\n<li>Activate data parsing with <code>UCI_DATA_API.process_available_data()</code></li>\n<li>Finalize answer into friendly data formats with <code>UCI_DATA_API.process_result()</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>From that point, the parsed result can be obtained as a JSON file through <code>UCI_DATA_API.getJSON()</code>\nor as a python dictionary though <code>UCI_DATA_API.get_result()</code>.</p>\n<p>Tests can also be preformed by running the UCI_DATA_API.py file.</p>\n<h2>Usage (Parser)</h2>\n<p>After construction, one of the following functions must be called and bound to the parser:\n    - <code>get_HTML_from_url()</code>\n    - <code>get_HTML_from_string()</code>\n    - <code>get_HTML_from_file()</code>\n Each specifies a different type of html source, and at least one must be selected before continuing.</p>\n<p>To initiate parsing, call <code>HTMLReferenceTree.parse_data()</code>. The resulting parser state can then carry out find operations on the data.</p>\n<p>Tests can also be preformed by running the <code>OneHack_HTML_Parser.py</code> file.</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>Some basic examples:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>courseManager = ClassDataManager()\ncourseManager.set_html_target()\ncourseManager.process_available_data()\ncourseManager.process_result()\ncourseManager.getJSON()\n\nfoodManager = FoodDataManager()\nfoodManager.get_pippins_food()\nfoodManager.process_available_data()\nfoodManager.process_result()\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition to these basic examples, running <code>OneHack_HTML_Parser.py</code> or <code>UCI_DATA_API.py</code> will start testing programs.</p>\n<h2>Requirements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Python 3.3 or greater</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Development</h2>\n<p>Created as a part of the HACK UCI Hackathon</p>\n<p>While simple, the <code>UCI_DATA_API</code> provides all the potentially useful methods of locating and parsing both UCI meal and course data. It also prepares the result for JSON encoding or usage as a dictionary.</p>\n<p>The lightweight, HTML parser is built on python's basic html parser, yet provides additional functions and details for quickly locating and iterating through data. In particular, it provides an internal array of HTML id attributes, for rapid searching by ID. The search by attributes, however, expects more than one answer and thus, must do a thorough, linear search through all data nodes.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <code>HTMLReferenceTree</code> class works primarily with HTMLNodes, a simple implementation of a node for quick access of children and parents. HTMLNodes are also equipped with basic comparision operators for sorting purposes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/VarunS1997/OneUCI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/VarunS1997/OneUCI\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["In short, I did much of the back-end data processing and html scraping.", "Designed icons, worked on gui design and implementation.", "I worked on the GUI and helped design the layout for the application.

Since language problems persist among international students we thought of building something on those terms. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>One Lang recognizes text from an image and translates it into the language you want. It can be helpful for non-native people as they can capture the image that contains the unfamiliar text and get its translation in the language they want.There is also an option to upload an image in case you already have it.  The bottom is that: You don't need to struggle anymore! </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We coded it in python using Tkinter for a GUI using different libraries and modules such as opencv, py-translate, etc. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had to find the most efficient translation method- an API or an inbuilt method. It took the time to read through the documentations and understand to go about it. We had to discard many ideas so it was time-consuming. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud of successfully being able to capture an image or upload an image, recognize it's text and gets its translation. We're proud to finish this in about 24 hours. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that parsing text from an image can be really helpful in day to day life as the world is digitalising. Our next steps focusing on Augmented Reality which is the growing technology of the day. Making people's life easier is what is the need of the hour and learned to accomplish. </p>\n<h2>What's next for One Lang</h2>\n<p>Right now, we have only enabled translation in Hindi. But we see it giving the user options for the various languages which he could transfer it into. We also envision an application running on Android and iOS with the capabilities of AR converting text in real time without even taking pictures.

This internet trend is deceptive and tedious, so we decided to do something about it.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>ClickBlock is a chrome extension that automatically detects click-bait articles in your Facebook feed. Articles identified as click-bait are highlighted in red, and have their title replaced to be a more accurate description. Additionally, the extension provides a summary of the article when the user hovers over it.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>ClickBlock was built using a flask server that handles the processing and identification of articles. A chrome extension calls the server and replaces the appropriate content.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we tried to make calls to the server through the web page itself but ran into issues with https validation. Facebook uses https protocol and was blocking our requests to the server. To work around this issue, we delegated the calls to browser instead of the webpage.</p>\n<p>While scraping data for training our classifier, we ran into issues with the New York times using async calls for displaying the articles. In order to solve this problem we, analysed the requests being made to identify the xhr call responsible for displaying article content, which we simulated in our scraper.</p>\n<p>We also tried to implement our own article summarizer, but rapidly ran into issues with the quality of the summaries. Natural language processing is a large and complicated problem that we did not have enough time to solve during the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team worked together cohesively despite all of our members being from different countries.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to create a chrome extension, as well as how to use web scraping as an effective tool for obtaining useful data.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ClickBlock</h2>\n<p>UI updates and improved article classification would provide the finishing polish for this project.

A UCI alumnus made <a href=\"https://antplanner.appspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Antplanner</a>, which is a huge step up from the original, but it still lacks something: The ability to schedule the courses you want to take for you, automatically. <strong>HackSoC</strong> is our answer to this problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>HackSoC fetches the course schedule by scraping the text interface of the original WebSOC provided by UCI, askes the user for their preferences, and computes an optimized schedule for the user (still in progess). Like a particular instructor? Don't want to take 8am classes? All of above can be specified as preferences on the HackSoC interface.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote a parser of the WebSOC's text interface in Python, which spits out a clean, object-oriented representation of UCI's entire class schedule. Then, we implemented a master-tree for section and time choices, in order to accomplish the task of generating an optimized class schedule for the user.</p>\n<p>For the user interface, we made a static webpage, with some <a href=\"http://materializecss.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Materialize</a> love. It takes the user's preferences, and hits our Python backend at our Flask API. Then, it periodically polls our API for the progress, and eventually obtains the optimized class schedule when it's available.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The automatic scheduler was the hardest part of the project. There are far too many possible course arrangements, even with a small set of courses to consider (4 to 5). We were very lucky to receive assistance from mentors at Cylance, who suggested ways to skip unnecessary branches.</p>\n<p>It was a challenge to parse WebSOC's text output and figure out the associations between class sections (e.g. lectures and discussions), too. The format of WebSOC's text output varies a lot, depending on the course and its individual sections. We dug through UCI's course offerings, and finally wrote the parser which should (hopefully) handle most of WebSOC's quirks. We found some interesting courses along the way, too :P</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>To be honest, we feel extremely lucky and proud that we got close to our goals of producing entire schedules. The parser underwent a major restructure, which broke a lot of things. It was a very educational experience.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Actually, we already answered this in the previous sections :) Throughout the hackathon, we learned a lot about parsers and tried our hands on a couple of search and optimization algorithms.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HackSoC</h2>\n<p>Take over UCI, of course! Jokes aside, we will definitely work to get the scheduler to work first (if we are unable to before the demo). Then, we'd like to rewrite HackSoC to be cleaner and easier to maintain (as the name says, the whole thing is pretty hacky). We are also considering new features, including the ability to perserve user preferences cross sessions, and suggest courses based on major requirements.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Texas Hold 'em Game", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>The main source of inspiration for this project is my hallmates and all our late night poker games. </p>\n<p>The simulation is a purely computer run model that shows the hands dealt, and the best hand of every player.

I have no ill will against my teammates but losing them put this project very close to being off the rails.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PoolBuddy</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://app.getpippy.com/karan/hackuci/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://app.getpippy.com/karan/hackuci/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>app.getpippy.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PGrad/HackUCI_Carpool_Backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PGrad/HackUCI_Carpool_Backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/PGrad/HackUCI_Carpool_FrontEnd\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/PGrad/HackUCI_Carpool_FrontEnd\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Returnto.Me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Returnto.Me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/263/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our Beautiful Homepage</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Returnto.Me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/262/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>my profile page.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Returnto.Me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/261/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Ugh, I lost my iphone!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Returnto.Me \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/265/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Thank You! &lt;3</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Returnto.Me \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/264/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Let me do the search for you!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Returnto.Me \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/271/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Notification for searching an item</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Returnto.Me \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/459/272/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Brainstroming Time, we dont lose anything here!</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>_ \"Faith in humanity restored by one angel at a time.\" _</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When we forget our wallet at a public place, there\u2019s not much we can do except go back and look around the area for it. But those who find a lost item, they can either bring it to a near shop, or hold on to it and ask around, or just leave the item there and hope for the best. In today\u2019s technological culture, there should be a website that resolves this common occurrence.</p>\n<p>Losing items and finding lost items are common issues. We want to provide a rewarding platform for the \"right\" thing to do: report a lost item. Returnto.Me, a web application, introduces a social twist to help promote the angel in us. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The service provides users who report finding a lost item to find users who report having lost a closely matched item. \nUsers can be endorsed for finding and successfully returning lost items to their original owners. Endorsement comes in the form of a ranking system and rewards. For instance, a user can become an angel and gain monetary rewards.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using javascript, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, Mongodb, HTML/CSS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge was bringing together a group of people who had primarily back-end experience and a primitive understanding of javascript. For us, this was one of the first Restful web apps we implemented. So the primary challenge was tooling and designing.</p>\n<p>Other challenges included implementing the ranking system/protocol for users. Also, we tried to use fuzzy matching logic/ ElasticSearch to match lost/found items in the database when returning the information to users who find items. However, the time remaining restricted our ability to integrate it with Mongoose.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Implementing an actual server all within a javascript development environment is a great accomplishment, considering our level of understanding of the language. We are also very proud of the front-end UI. But in terms of collaborative development, we are proud of just being able to implement a Restful web application together.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>So much about Restful web apps, Mongodb, and github merging conflicts (-__-).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Returnto.Me</h2>\n<p>Implementing a smarter ranking system/protocol, and item-matching sysem.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ponylucifel/SPARK\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ponylucifel/SPARK\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I lead this team into building this web application.

We struggled to put together meals with the ingredients in our fridge in a restricted amount of time. KitchenBuddy directly addresses this struggle with a few additional features!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>KitchenBuddy allows the user to search for recipes through specified restrictions such as ingredients you already have on hand, dietary preferences, and amount of time to cook. It searches through a database of over 2 million recipes and returns the top 50 results adhering to your options. The results are ordered by an additional feature, percent of ingredients matched, allowing the use to gain a sense of how many additional ingredients he/she will need to utilize. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our website is completely coded in front end languages, with Javascript conducting server side analysis. Using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS we formatted the layout of the website to be clean and provide key options. Javascript served multiple purposes constructing QuickCookCookBook. We imported jQuery to conduct search requests into the Yummly API, parse the results, and send them to the HTML file. We also used Javascript to calculate the algorithm for ingredients match.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>After discussing specifics of how to implement the project we decided to switch from our original plan to utilize javascript, css, and html, languages we had extremely limited experience in. Figuring out the interaction between the back-end and front-end was an aspect we struggled with because we were learning the language on the fly. In addition, we had difficulties creating the algorithm for and displaying the recipe match. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of creating a visually aesthetic layout that is intuitive to use and actually addresses a common issue among college students that can be expanded into any audience interested in cooking. We are excited to overcome and all of the setbacks we ran into and are able to submit a complete working product under the given time constraints. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that it is important to be able to be flexible and open-minded in terms of how you envisioned the product to be utilized. It is critical to be able to learn new tools quickly and be able to transition to code in a completely new language if needed. </p>\n<h2>What's next for QuickCook CookBook</h2>\n<p>Although QuickCookCookBook is fully functional, there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. On the user experience side, the website requires more attention to detail, such as color scheme and text contrast against images. Behind the scenes, our website can be improved by refining our algorithm for showing the matches.
