This is either because they don't know where to find it, or don't know how to tell what water sources near them are cleanest.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application lets users crowd-source water quality data. Users use our cheap spectrometer (constructed out of a phone + $10 of materials) to identify the presence of contaminants in water sources. The results of every test are uploaded to an AWS database that lets users who do not have access to a spectrometer look up water quality in their area. To do this we leveraged Mapquest, AWS lambda functions, DyanmoDB, and the AWS API gateway.</p>\n<h2>More info for those who are interested:</h2>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Hardware:\nWe built a spectrometer using the iPhone's camera. At one end, we have an LED source that emits light at a wavelength of 405 nm. We then direct this light so that it passes through a broken CD and then into the iPhone camera's lens. The broken CD acts like a prism, and splits the light into its component wavelengths (basically a rainbow). This allows the camera to easily see what wavelengths of light are being emitted at the source.</p>\n<p>So far what I've described just tells us what the wavelength of the light being emitted is. The next step is to make the light pass through the liquid we want to identify. As we know, water lets all wavelengths of light pass through it equally. On the other hand, contaminants (bacterial or otherwise) found in water both attenuate different wavelengths of light in unique ways, and fluoresce (re-emit the light at different, lower energy wavelengths). These attenuation/fluorescence 'fingerprints' mean that the wavelengths of light that reach the camera are unique based on the liquids that we've placed in our spectrometer.</p>\n<p>Software:\nThe software consists of two main parts:</p>\n<p>Front end:\nThe front end is an iOS phone app that uses MapQuest and GPS information to display water quality information near the user's location. It queries our backend through an AWS API that returns the crowdsourced water quality information. If people have access to a homemade spectrometer (like the one we created), they can contribute to our water-quality database by taking water quality readings with the application. These readings are automatically uploaded to the database.</p>\n<p>Back end:\nThe back end of our application consists of two AWS lambda functions and a DynamoDB database. The lambda functions take care of adding and retrieving water-quality information to/from the database. To determine whether the water is drinkable, we implemented a machine learning algorithm.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Going into this Hackathon, none of us had much Swift development experience. We ran into all sorts of issues because of this. In addition, we had never used AWS, and had never built a spectrometer, so it was a great learning experience for us all. I won't enumerate all of the specific challenges we ran into because there would be too many to list.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Everything we built! We are happy to have a mostly working spectrometer that lets people cheaply detect the presence of contaminants in their water supply. We are also very happy that this information is crowdsourced so that people know where to go to find the cleanest water without having to take tens of readings themselves.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Swift, DynamoDB, AWS lambda functions, AWS API gateway, and how to cheaply build a spectrometer</p>\n<h2>What's next for AquaSource</h2>\n<p>We are hoping to flesh out our MVP so that it will be more scalable and can actually be used on a large scale.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-dynamodb\">amazon-dynamodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-lambda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapquest\">mapquest</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on using Swift to interact with our API of crowdsourced water quality information, accessing current longitude/latitude coordinates, and parsing the bitmap image to get wavelength vs color intensity information to be fed into the machine learning model", "Created iPhone UI and flow", "I implemented machine learning algorithms to analyze spectra and built hardware.", "I built the API that enables crowd-sourcing of water quality information", "Connected with the MapQuest API to generate the map with markers.

PyGame also manages the event keys, and time.time() records the start and end time of each individual event. All of this data is stored in an object representing a Key press event, and then a Parser class uses several loops to sift through the data and calculate usable information, such as the average time between each possible combination of key presses, and the average amount of time each key has been pressed. All of this data is then written to a text file, while allows for easy organization of different users in the application and the machine learning algorithm. The machine learning algorithm looks at a large set of data from several different perspectives, and then creates a mathematical function to approximate it. This function is then used to categorize new data into a previously learned pattern, in order to authenticate a user.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Recording and formatting precise, usable data of staggered key press events required several complex nested loops and recursive functions, which required several hours of planning and rewriting code. The amount of raw data that was produced was a much larger quantity than we first expected, and therefore we had to adapt. Training and perfecting the machine learning algorithm in order to yield the most accurate possible approximation also took several hours. Finally, typing random sentences for hours in order to produce the necessary data to train the machine learning algorithm was painstaking. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to produce a program that accurately records unique data about how a person types, in a format that is usable by a machine learning algorithm. We were also able to develop a machine learning algorithm specific to this application, and produce data to train the algorithm and accurately categorize new data into already existing patterns in order to authenticate a user. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Everybody on the team became much more confident in the Python scripting abilities, and we all learned how to organize and manipulate large amount of data. We also learned about different machine algorithm approaches and how to train them to be more accurate. </p>\n<h2>What's next for NoTypePass</h2>\n<p>The concept of NoTypePass can be applied to a lot of different uses. We started the development of a Google chrome extension to work like the Chrome password manager, using keystroke dynamics to authenticate a user instead of a Google account login, and autofill these stored passwords into a webpage. We also plan to create a Unix and Windows services to record keystroke information in the background, to more efficiently and effectively learn how a person types while they work on homework or they next hackathon project. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy\">numpy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sci-kit-learn</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pygame\">pygame</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/camcrae/typepass\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/camcrae/typepass\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the word/passphrase generation, hashing the master password for storage, etc., and assisted in creation of the data calculations we used as our input data (averages, patterns, masterlist, key pairs, etc.)", "I worked on the GUI and the data recording and organizing.

With the help of cheap ubiquitous electrical elements like microcontrollers and vibration motors, anyone can easily build a system to passively acquire tactile skills like learning how to play an instrument, reading braille, and using morse code. An offshoot of PHL is Passive Haptic Rehabilitation (PHR), which has allowed patients with spinal cord injuries to more than double their recovery rate with the same equipment.</p>\n<p>Sensory Substitution is the effect that one type of sensory stimuli can be changed into another type of sensory stimuli. For example, visual information can be conveyed and perceived through our other senses, such as sound or touch. In this project, we substituted one's sense of sight with their sense of touch, allowing people to \"see\" and \"listen\" with their skin using a haptic encoding from the vibration motor.</p>\n<p>We first learned about Passive Haptic Learning when Sarthak started working with Wearable Computing research at Georgia Tech. After <a href=\"http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2980000/2971768/p164-seim.pdf?ip=131.96.219.171&amp;id=2971768&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=AA86BE8B6928DDC7%2E44E017FFD298019C%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=685146611&amp;CFTOKEN=68497216&amp;__acm__=1477221140_6c712dc240f0408338ed4fb6843eb2d5\" rel=\"nofollow\">conducting research and running experiments on its effectiveness</a>, we were all amazed by how quickly the human brain was able to learn the encoding pattern which transformed the visual input through sensory substitution into the replacement vibrations. We realized that the potential number of meaningful applications was tremendous.</p>\n<p>With Sarthak and Ralph familiar with the timeline of hackathons, we drew on their collective experience and decided that the time window given was a perfect way to test the practicality of our project. </p>\n<h1>What It Does</h1>\n<p>Haptic Vision consists of three stages\u00a0\u2013\u00a0a training stage, an object detection stage, and the blind communication phase. </p>\n<h2>Training Stage</h2>\n<p>In this stage, we teach the brain to make associations between the seemingly random vibration patterns felt on a forehead with the correct letters. We do this by first playing the sound of the letter we want the trainee to learn, and follow up with the vibration pattern corresponding to that character.</p>\n<h2>Object Detection Stage</h2>\n<p>In this stage, we use a deep convolutional neural network consisting of 32 different layers to process images captured from our laptop and understand the semantic contents of the image. The main job of the neural network is to classify images into a wide range of existing categories we used the same categories as the VGG-16. The network is able to understand what those objects are by continuously extracting higher level features from the pixels in an image. The first layers extract information like edges and shapes while the last layers contain much more abstract information about object positioning.</p>\n<p>We set up an experiment that could simulate conditions in which people with visual deficiency live in. We believe that this technology could potentially be used in the future to enable those people to be able to perceive objects through a haptic sensory extension. In order to do so, we place objects in a box, completely off the sights of our subject. Then, a camera is able to use AI to detect which objects are in the box and pass a signal to the haptic module. This enables the blind person to \"see\" and understand what those objects are through the haptic model, effectively restoring their capacity to perceive objects again</p>\n<h2>Blind Communication Phase</h2>\n<h1>How We Built It</h1>\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\n<p>The hardware circuit consists of a Arduino Uno controller, breadboard, and vibration motor. The electronic circuit was then securely attached to a hat, allowing for ease of wear for our testing subject.</p>\n<h2>Software to Communicate with Arduino</h2>\n<p>The Arduino itself runs in Arduino, which is in the family of C languages. We made a Python virtual environment to communicate with the Arduino using serial communication. Python acts as the gluing component in our software architecture, allowing the project to take information from the neural network and feed it into the Arduino.\nWe used the pySerial github repository to aid with this cross-device communication.</p>\n<h2>Neural Network</h2>\n<p>VGG16: 32 Layer Convolutional Neural Network whose architecture was originally envisioned by the VGG team.</p>\n<h1>Challenges We Ran Into</h1>\n<p>We had difficulty building the neural network to decipher handwritting and recognizing objects that weren't on the ImageNet dataset.</p>\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\n<p>There were several Arduino components that we could not use in this project due to lack of access.</p>\n<h2>Software Limits</h2>\n<p>We weren't able to get access to the Predix platform in time to deploy our Neural Network model to the cloud. That was unfortunate, since we believe that this could have had a great impact in the future. The AI software could have been used by multiple IoT devices and the platform could be used to constantly improve the quality of our service.</p>\n<h1>Accomplishments We Are Proud Of</h1>\n<p>We actually managed to train someone in a realistic setting! It only took a few hours for our volunteer to be able to decode the sensory input from the vibration motor into a meaningful substitution for vision. We were also able to enable people to directly write messages to Brandon through their computers. This means that, in the future, this technology could be used a a hands free form of messaging. The technology was also promising at object recognition, enabling Brandon to effectively \"see\" which objects were in the box through the device. This means that a future iteration of this project could be fully used to help blind users navigate their environments effectively. </p>\n<h1>What's Next for Haptic Vision</h1>\n<p>We plan to do further research on how much better this hack can get with the integration of multiple tactile motors in it. Brandon was able to easily read sentences and identify objects with only one motor for encoding the information, so we wonder how much better can we do if we had access to more motors in either a vest or belt using a grid design. We want to know if this could enable us to encode messages faster to our users or even pass in more complicated information. One cool application that could follow for a better haptic module would be teaching people how to sing or play musical instruments better, for example</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">deep-learning</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">convolutional-neural-networks</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">morse-code</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sarthaksrinivas/haptic-vision\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sarthaksrinivas/haptic-vision\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OmzO0AFuZ-Iki91gvFv58UlYx-2Mpc4CyOJfQTGfvcw/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OmzO0AFuZ-Iki91gvFv58UlYx-2Mpc4CyOJfQTGfvcw/edit?usp=sharing\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>docs.google.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["As a Wearable Computing Researcher at Georgia Tech, I conducted research demonstrating Passive Haptic Learning's viability.

As college students, we experience anxiety and crippling depression first-hand. Our goal was to create a mobile application that will bring some sunshine to those who are feeling these negative emotions. Pawsitivity was the result. </p>\n<h2>Application Description</h2>\n<p>Pawsitivity is an app that combines inspirational quotes to get you motivated and cute cats to deliver you a smile. Users can choose their favorite color cat who will give you a quote when you tap on them. </p>\n<p>In honor of Halloween just over a week away, this app also offers 8 different costume choices, such as a mummy, a pineapple, and a chef. We made these customization options with the hope that it brings someone joy while customizing their own special cat! </p>\n<p>After selecting your cat, simply tap on the screen for instant motivational quotes!</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p><strong>Android application</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Design: Adobe Illustrator</li>\n<li>VCS: Github</li>\n<li>CI/CD: codeship</li>\n<li>Rest API: Node.js &lt;- Heroku</li>\n<li>Database: MongoDB &lt;- Heroku</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>While the idea of Pawsitivity is very simple and straight forward, we found during our brainstorming process that we envisioned many customization and preferences options for the user. However, these settings, such as updating the color and outfit of the cat in runtime for the users to see, were more challenging that expected. </p>\n<p>The group's idea of the app was largely influenced by popular apps on the market that utilize lots of animation to communicate what is happening to the user. We imagined lots of animated snippets to really bring a more professional touch to our application. However, actually implementing moving images was difficult for both building graphics and for coding it in the app, and thus the amount of animation was decreased to a more manageable level during the time period. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest aspects of Pawsitivity is the fact that all of the graphics were created from scratch specifically for this project. The members of our group worked together to bring together Halloween-themed designs for the costumes and cats that would make anyone smile! </p>\n<p>We also spent considerable time setting up a database and API to keep track of users and their customized cats. This database recognizes if the user already has an account or if a new account must be made. </p>\n<h2>Learning Experiences</h2>\n<p>For some members of this group, this project was their first encounter with Android Studio and building a native Android application. </p>\n<p>We also further developed design skills while creating the necessary vector graphics using Adobe Illustrator. Because Adobe products tend to have a high learning curve, we needed to communicate effectively between members to teach and to learn.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p><strong>User-Interface</strong></p>\n<p>The options given to the user are limited in the app at the moment, but we would like to add more customization features, such as naming the cat, choosing between more outfits, and picking different colors of cats (perhaps with a color picker for the adventurous minds). </p>\n<p>Our initial plan for Pawsitivity was to create many other animals other than cats, such as puppies, bunnies, polar bears, etc. With more time for implementation and graphics, this is definitely possible and we hope to add them to the collection. We also hope to implement animation for individual animals as well as for the user experience of the entire application as a whole. </p>\n<p>Pawsitivity can be gamified by adding more interactions with your pets, such as feeding them and playing with them to increase their health and happiness level. Allowing the user to be in control of the cat might bring some peace to the anxious user by giving them something to nurture. This effect has been shown in the popularity of apps such as Forest (a distraction management application that allows you to plant a virtual tree if you do not use your phone for 30 minutes; if you do use your phone for a non-emergency matter, the tree will die) and Neko Atsume (a game that allows the user to leave out food and toys to gather cats). </p>\n<p><strong>User-Interaction</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest things we wanted to communicate to those who suffer from anxiety disorders and/or depression is that they are not alone. We would like to translate this in our application by adding user-to-user communication. The user can take a photo of their pet and quote (or write their own!) and send it to their friends via SMS, Facebook, Twitter, etc. </p>\n<p>There are times, however, that no matter how cute the pet and how inspiring the quote, the user may need more professional help than we can offer. For these situations, we would like to implement a way for them to reach the services they need, such as hotlines and 911 emergency.</p>\n<p><strong>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>\n<p>Customization features can go beyond just appearance of the pet. The user will be able to choose from categories of quotes that they would like to see, and we could implement for the application to gradually learn their preferences through machine learning and a rating system for individual quotes. </p>\n<p>For situations described earlier that a user requires more services, the application can learn if a user is possibly in need of such help and be able to respond effectively. </p>\n<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>\n<p>After polishing up our app and adding the features we weren't able to get to, we are thinking of releasing it to the Google Play store for real users to download and use. We would love to expand Pawsitivity to iOS as well, where we can reach out to more people who may be suffering from depression or anxiety. </p>\n<h2>Finishing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Overall, we really enjoyed building this application and have great hopes for it to move forward as an aid for anyone who can use a smile! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">codeship</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/yeejkoobt/Pawsitivity\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/yeejkoobt/Pawsitivity\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on both the frontend and backend Pawsitivity.

The terms and phrases used by people is native to their region. For example, in my town, people say, \"Wow, that was rattling!\" all the time. It means that something was mind boggling.

After all, they can hide their face, hide their clothes, hide their presence \u2013 but they can\u2019t hide their temperature, can they? With that in mind, we decided to work on an idea for a heat map security system, one that updates based on the users\u2019 preferences, and alerts them to any new and drastic changes in temperature.</p>\n<p>Our work starts off with the Intel Edison superchip, where Shubin and Guangzheng were able to configure the chip for its temperature scanner. They worked in C++ to handle the data, convert it all to Fahrenheit and subsequently simplified it into a matrix of temperatures, which would be a picture of the scanned region, but with numbers representing the people, objects and nearby items.</p>\n<p>After that, Maaz took the textfile with the matrix of temperatures, and plugged it into MATLAB. Since heat maps are colored relative to the highest and lowest temperature of the picture, the data was computed to automatically pinpoint the highest and lowest temperature in the matrix, and associate color to each temperature value. When this was done, the matrix of temperatures now had a colored image of the scanned area, where reddish colors signified hotter temperatures and bluer / blacker colors signified colder temperatures.</p>\n<p>A suggestion to the processing was to add a segment that detected drastic changes in temperature, and alert the user of a suspicious entry.  In addition, when the program compared the outlier temperatures to the average temperature of the outlier\u2019s ambience, it would run through a table of potential threats classified by initial temperature and temperature difference. From this, when it sends an alert to the user, it also suggests a possible cause for the change in temperature. Unfortunately, we were not able to implement all of these changes in the time we had, though we certainly are and will be working on it after the judging is over.</p>\n<p>In the unpredictable case that MATLAB failed with its processing, Nitharjan worked on R Programming to come up with code that would also take the matrix of temperatures ( this time in a .csv file ), attach colors to each temperature value, and produce a brilliantly colored heat map. Even though MATLAB has been selected for our setup, the heatmap code and support in R Programming also gives us a feasible alternative in case there is a system that does not support MATLAB.</p>\n<p>After that, Huang took the heatmap pictures from MATLAB and added to our project\u2019s website, which has the constantly updating heatmap right on the front page, along with a list of user alerts generated by the code. Heat Maps are best viewed on large screens ( i.e. computers, TVs, security camera monitors ), so the idea of developing an app for mobile devices to load a constantly updating heat map was quickly ruled out. Thus, a website was used to bring all the data and results together, and present our hack in a neat and considerable fashion.</p>\n<p>With that, thank you for reading, and if we have not already, we would be proud to present our HackGSU\u2019s hack: Heat Signature Security. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into two major roadblocks along the way. The first one involved the Intel Edison's temperature scanner having a scan range that was infinitesimally smaller than what we had estimated. We continued our code in the hopes that when we are able to use technology of our own choosing, our code will work as intended, and return a very accurate and colorful heatmap of the surroundings. For now, we are working with the Intel Edison in lieu of the proper technology.</p>\n<p>The other challenge was more of a disagreement over whether MATLAB would be compatible with the data we got from the Intel Edison, and after we talked about our choices, we decided to invest some time in R Programming, where Nitharjan spent time on Saturday learning the basics and in-depth functions to replicate the heat map in R Programming. It was a worthwhile adventure, as we currently now have 2 methods to process the data and produce heat maps that we can add to the website.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>On the first day, we all came together and had a laugh over the notion that we beginners, could create something interesting and catchy from our combined lack of experience and recent introduction to programming. But we did exactly that. We pooled together whatever computer languages we knew, and managed to create a system that not only works, but looks great while protecting your interests at home. On top of that, we were able to acknowledge our technological constraints and proceed with our project, despite the fact that it's likely that someone points out how tiny our scanner is. Our project isn't perfect, but after all, who said it had to be perfect after a measly 36 hours of work?</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>It's incredible to recount just how many things we've learned since we started. For starters, we set out as beginners in programming, and spent a good chunk of time studying, coding, debugging, and learning about all sorts of functions, methods - code that we probably would never see in class for the next several years. The introduction workshops were pretty nice as well, but we also immensely benefited by going around the hall and talking to other groups. Ideas fly quickly in an environment like this, and learning of other hackers' hacks and methodology really gave us a fresh set of perspectives that we used to keep looking at our project, and determine if it was still feasible, still relevant, and still accomplishing our goal. We learned a helluva' lot, and it's only just starting.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Heat Signature Security</h2>\n<p>For the sake of appearances and an ideal implementation, we have a list of user alerts on the website that note drastic temperature changes and suggest a reason for the drop or rise. However, our code does not return that list at the moment. After our judging, we plan to return to our code to analyze the interference's temperature, the surrounding temperature, and the temperature discrepancy, and compare it to a table of values we plan to include. These values, if satisfied by the three temperature conditions, will suggest an already coded reason as to why there might be a difference in temperature. </p>\n<p>For example, if the room is at room temperature, and a stove is lit to temperatures of above 100 deg F, then the program can use a heat map to look at these three temperature values, and suggest that the stove is being turned on. In regards to the cold weather outside, if someone decided to break into a house by breaking or opening a window, the heat map system would detect the sudden drop in temperature near the window, compare it to the room temperature, and conclude that the window was opened. </p>\n<p>As it is right now, it is not an AI system, though it would be certainly nice to move it in that direction.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["LVLS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LVLS \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/457/150/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"LVLS \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/457/151/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration for <strong>LVLS</strong> stems from a casual conversation with an affiliated member of the HARMAN company that demonstrated a fundamental absence in visual equalizer functionality.

With couple revision of our innovation. We are teenagers/ young adults that are not willing to accept the acknowledgement of \"adulting\". Instead we wanted make our lazier lives even more lazier(but smarter) by creating our innovation. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The program detects objects by color and tracks their camera position. By being able to track  the items position, we are able to gain a clear depiction of where a particular item stands in a camera view. It shall be used in common house holds to keep track of lost items for the owner. The software is also able to relay information back the items location though text to speech. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The team wondered many ways of trying to implement our idea. We realized that we have webcams and googled \"How to track motion on webcam\". Then Googled spat our an answer <strong>OpenCV</strong>, then from there, many hours of researching this new open source. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I personally ran into many different errors. From the beginning our hack, I have encountered a problem with Python on Mac and virtualenvwrapper. I have not set my PATH for Python in the beginning which gave me trouble. But the worst problem I have encountered so far was not the coding. But setting up a new environment for the project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>From Day 1, I have not used Python or even heard of OpenCV. And till now, I have not mastered, but I do have more strong grasp of Python, which is SO much better than Java, simply because of the high-level and the syntax. OpenCV is something new and I hope I will be using it for many side projects to come. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I have learned that everyone has their <strong>strengths and weakness</strong>. And notice that everyone in a hackathon does not know everything. And it feels like a sense of noticeability between peers and friends when accomplishing a task that was started as an idea. From the beginning, we knew that we would not win, but my team had a sense of wanting, the want of completing the idea from nothing to something. And as we look back as a team, we have came very far.

When viewed from the perspective of the advertising industry, this change in attention span amounts to a waste of millions of dollars of lost revenue. Advertising plays a fundamental role in the dissemination of information for nearly every corporation and the overloading of advertising has served to the determent of all companies involved. \nIn order to match with the present trends of the people,today's information spreading methods need to become more individualistic and less in the form of generic background noise the average consumer. In order to do so, we thought about improving something that everyone sees everyday, the digital billboard. Through the utility of the Watson API which is basically something which detects the type of things you're interested in based on you're appearance, age and gender in order to spread information that is relevant to individuals as well as supplementation by Google's Vision API, our billboards are able to further tailor and select advertising which is more impacful in their daily lives and thus help people gain knowledge about products they are more likely interested in. </p>\n<h2>What is Watson Advertisements</h2>\n<p>Watson Advertisement is an enhancement on the existing billboard by presenting relevant advertisements to people that are eyecatching providing a greater hit on the amount of the advertising which actually leads to an actionable result. The advertisement technique involved is using a camera which takes pictures of the area in front of the billboard at set intervals of time and uses the Watson API in order to categorize certain aspects of the visible and then change the billboard information into a relevant topic for a particular demographic. \nWatson advertisement only displays information that is relevant to the people that are standing in front of it and does not displays anything that is not relevant to the set of people around it. \nFurthermore, if a person is interested in a project, it is seen that the person looks at that particular advertisement for about 10 seconds and this billboard just need 8 seconds to know whether the person is interested or not based on whether if the person is present in the consecutive picture of the surrounding. If the person is present, then the billboard will display a video which is relevant to the image that was displayed earlier so as to slowly gather the attention of people.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>A major problem what we faced was decreasing the latency from the stream into the Watson API as the camera must take pictures at certain intervals of time while being subject to a constantly changing view. The addition of latency makes it difficult to have responsive and immediate feedback to the viewer and cuts into the already short attention span. Our solution to this problem was to create a cloud server that could give lesser latency as well as subvert a technical limitation of the Nest Cameras inability to connect to Enterprise or Captive network through a laptop wifi passthrough. </p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>In order to make this a fully refined product, we would focus on using any USB camera in order to take the input that is able to distinguish in between the objects, have minimal latency, and hence can enable the Watson API to analyse images at a really fast rate and based on that display a more responsive which is suitable based on the type of people present around it. Advertisements to be displayed also have the potential of being downloaded directly from advertising partners who can update them at their own discretion. \nThese billboards can be used in order to ensure that the company can push it's product to the consumer who are actually in need of it and the advertising done by the company becomes much more resourceful than it usually is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nest\">nest</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wifi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/karunchillz/HackRice2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/karunchillz/HackRice2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I reverse engineered the stream protocol used by the Nest camera,  which I then used to rip still frames which were then analysed by Watson ", "I helped in integrating the NEST camera with the server and worked on the algorithm in order to know which advertisement to show based on the camera input based on outputs given by the Watson and Google Vision API.", "I created the backend server which will get input from the NEST camera and output the advertisement onto billboards.
