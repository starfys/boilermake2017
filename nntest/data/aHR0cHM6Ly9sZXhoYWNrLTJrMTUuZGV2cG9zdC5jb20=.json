After finding a nice impeller in the last few days, we decided to do something with it, eventually settling on a game.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is an interactive game that uses a LeapMotion to track a user's hand and rotate a gimballed impeller fan to suspend a ball. The object of the game is to navigate the ball though metal wire hoops in the air while keeping it levitated. The fan can suspend the ball around 40 degrees from the vertical axis, so the user has lots of space to move around in.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used a 3D printer to create most of the hardware in the game. The models we used were all created during the hackathon using SOLIDWORKS. We also used balsa wood for simple surfaces like the box that the game is housed in. The fan is rotated by two servos, each on a horizontal axis perpendicular to the other. Using a dual gimbal system, we can rotate the fan to point in any direction. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We encountered a few setbacks during this project, most of them being unforeseen consequences. For instance, we had a few 3D prints that we needed to modify and remake later due to a problem we did not anticipate like a collision between two parts in the complex gimbal. Also, it took some time to perfectly coordinate the LeapMotion with the servos. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We're very proud of being able to finish a project like this within a 12-hour timespan. We all learned things today that we didn't know beforehand, as well as some lessons we can apply to our future projects.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Think about all the possible positions for a part to take before you model it. Be sure it doesn't interfere with anything else, or vice versa.</li>\n<li>Be careful with electronics. You can accidentally destroy parts if you're not sure of the circuitry beforehand.\n## What's next for Mystic Wind of the East\nCollege mostly!</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Squad Up (Team 9)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>What does it do?</h2>\n<p>SquadUp offers an innovative and expansive feature set to help bring the crew together. Plan meetups and hangouts with unparalleled efficiency using SquadUp's powerful fam management toolset.</p>\n<h2>Why was this made?</h2>\n<p>Throughout the history of social gatherings, squads and fams alike have used inefficient methods such as bulk emails or groups or even Facebook group chats to manage the organization of events. Never again will a SquadUp user find themselves asking \"where my boys at?\" - for SquadUp offers a live preview of locations of each and every member of the meetup. Big brother? No! Big <em>family</em>! Take that, flaky friends!</p>\n<h2>The Dirty Details</h2>\n<p>SquadUp's feature set is wide, but it's essence can be distilled down to doing a few things, and doing them <em>well</em>. First, SquadUp offers an administrative front. Group leaders can create events and give the group's code to each member however they please. Those invited members can then either confirm or deny their participation in a meetup, which group leaders can see. Past that, however, SquadUp seeks to <strong>organize</strong>. SquadUp cleans up group chats, helping group members not in the chat at the time of organization still be filled in on the plan. No more will a group's love of memes hold back actual social interaction. Finally, SquadUp is designed to be globally accessible. Its mobile-optimized HTML5 website enables any user with a web browser to engage in squads.</p>\n<h2>The Dirtier Details</h2>\n<p>This project began its life as an Android app which would use NFC to create a sort of virtual-reality game which would reward users who could tap their phones to the squad leader's the quickest. However, due to a mixture of structural difficulties with the Android platform and paradigm shifts, the team realized the potential that such an organized group management tool had to revolutionize the social world, and set out to transform SquadUp into the tool it is now. Under the hood, SquadUp works on a Node.js server. Socket.io handles <strong>real-time</strong> inbound and outbound communications. jQuery and Bootstrap are used to display content-rich webpages. Finally, Google's Maps and Location Service APIs are used to provide constantly-updating location data for all squad members.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://squaduptest.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://squaduptest.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>squaduptest.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Constructed the entire back end in node js and socket.io. coded the map behavior- syncing markers on the map for each user", "", "", ""]], ["CommComm", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"CommComm \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/210/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The primary goal of this application is to access applications and do various tasks on your computer through voice commands from your phone.

Since we had 12 hours, we decided on a fairly basic classic RPG -- a genre now mostly forgotten, but which is our foundation of our gaming careers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It's an RPG... mostly. The combat is more reminiscent of an arcade shooter, but the overworld and encounters are classic RPG-style. Unfortunately, 12 hours wasn't enough to make more than the core mechanics and a single map.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We build the project in Processing, a Java environment that includes a fairly extensive graphic library, making it easier to use for programs like graphic-based applets and the such than a typical Java compiler such as Eclipse.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Time constraints were real. The core game mechanics took most of our time, so we didn't really get to add much other than one map and one scaling encounter. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Making this game at all -- some of the mechanics weren't so easy to code, especially the various screen transitions and the combat portion. Collision also posed a couple of problems, as did figuring out how to import music and loop it.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This project helped us with consistency in coding, specifically not making as many mistakes before compiling the program. In addition, we learned how to code tougher graphical interactions such as collisions. This project also helped us learn to enjoy ourselves when programming, something others should aspire towards. </p>\n<h2>What's next for RPG ~ the RPG</h2>\n<p>We're considering adding more content in the future -- more maps, more enemies, equipment, etc; make it more than just a grinding shooter, but rather something more reminiscent of a classic RPG -- with some shooting elements in there, though.

If we had more time, we could develop our web application further and include more features that would differentiate our creation from others. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Musical Island", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Musical Island \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/306/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Musical Island \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/307/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Musical Island \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/305/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Musical Island</p>\n<p>Our project acts as a piano tutorial where the player learns through mimicking presented tunes. There are three songs, each progressively more complex. In this way we aim to grow the skillset of the user. In addition, this piano is presented through the medium of an interactive story in which Elton John, our dashing protagonist, finds his way off of a dangerous, secluded island by summoning the powers of animals through music. Collectively, we improved our ability to understand and implement HTML and Java syntax, store variables across different HTML files,  integrate audio files into javascript, and generally make simple text-based adventures more complex and more intriguing. During the brainstorming process, we decided to make a text-based adventure. This medium allowed game formatting as well as an educational component which would allow the user to grow their knowledge alongside a beloved character. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["D&D Map Maker- Team 17", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"D&amp;D Map Maker- Team 17 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/378/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration was because one of the kids on the team really wanted it for his D&amp;D club at school, since dry-erase boards designed for purpose can be quite expensive.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It generates a grid based map with various terrain objects.

There is also room for better graphic design and more graphic options.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>For team 17, we coded a Dungeons and Dragons game board generator with custom textures. The project was coded in Java and used swing graphics. The generator uses a grid system of the user\u2019s desired size and allows them to place a custom texture in any of those spaces with special features such as elevation change, blockers and doorways. The program also has some designer friendly features such as tile duplication.  \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Zebras Are Better Than You", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Zebras Are Better Than You \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/291/085/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Hannah likes zebras</h2>\n<p>_ We like Hannah and having fun _</p>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]]]
