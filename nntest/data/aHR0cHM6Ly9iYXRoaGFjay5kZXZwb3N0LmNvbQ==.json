</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Whenever you buy movies or games, usually a code is present for some online media that you aren't usually interested in. Digital codes also exist for a myriad of different formats, you may receive them by gift, or you may decided you didn't want it before you used it.\nSelling these codes isn't all that difficult, but you are hit with large eBay and Paypal fees, alongside the lack of automated code sending.\nBuying the codes, again, isn't difficult, but sometimes you may be waiting a long time to receive the code from the seller.\nAnother concern with the buying and selling of codes is security, it's very easy to sell a \"dud\" code to someone and simply accuse them of lying about said \"dud\" code. Due to the lack of identity surrounding communities that may trade these code.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Dicode is a peer to peer digital code buying and selling platform/marketplace. Dicode forces all users, regardless of intent to buy or sell, to have a fully authorised Stripe account, meaning that bank account details, billing addresses and legal names must be used. Once authorised, users can post up products they wish to sell. The code is entered when you list the item to sell, therefore, when bought, the code is instantly delivered to the buyer. Once bought, a feedback system is in place to allow the buyer to notify the system and other users, whether this seller has a good ratio of good to \"dud\" codes.\nIn order for the platform to make money, a small 5% application fee is taken on buyer payment.\nUsers can search for the codes they want based on name, category and price range.</p>\n<p>In just 24 hours, this application has actually been placed live and multiple real-life purchases have been made.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Ruby on Rails has been used in conjunction with Heroku to get the app live.\nStripe's OAuth implementation has been used for user creation.\nStripe Connect has been used to allow us to place money in our seller's account without the need for continued approval, as well as take the application fee.\nBootstrap provided a fantastic stepping stone to get the app looking great</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge was getting a payment from a buyer's card, to a seller's stripe account, with an application fee making the way to our platform's account, all in 1 go.</p>\n<p>Another challenge was getting the app to be usable and look nice in just 24 hours whilst being up against the wall with the sheer amount of backend work needed.</p>\n<p>Using Stripes OAuth to get our users, rather than using a traditional email and password sign up was an interesting and new problem to solve.</p>\n<p>The problem of \"what if?\" when it comes to people using \"dud\" codes is a hard problem to get across. However, by forcing full Stripe authorization, a big brickwall is put up to stop people from abusing the system. The addition of the feedback system creates a great foundation to build on for the future, regarding this issue. It is important to remember that when it comes to buying and selling online, regardless of digital content or not, trust is required. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are extremely proud of getting a fully P2P marketplace in to production within 24 hours. In its current state it is fully usable, it's not perfect, but it serves its purpose.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learnt about a lot more ruby \"gems\", which are community created code snippets that help with various issues.\nWe learnt that dealing with payments online is rather troublesome, and even harder to test properly.\nWe learnt that trust can never be fully modeled in an online environment.\nWe learnt that Stripe is an absolutely extraordinary product.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Dicode</h2>\n<p>Considering we managed to achieve so much in such little time, we are thinking about taking steps towards adding a few more things that would make the product fully \"public ready\". In it's current state it can be used for its purpose absolutely fine, but there are some fundemental things missing that no website should be launching without. This includes proper mailing (registration mailers, payment invoices etc) and in particular for a system involving a marketplace, some sort of dispute system, which we planned but decided against due to time constraints.\nTerms and conditions and privacy policies are also lacking. Due to the nature of Stripe Connect, the seller is lawfully treated as their own merchant, which takes a lot of the heat off of our backs when it comes to legal issues and the like. However, this needs to be made clear.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://dicode.co\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://dicode.co\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>dicode.co</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Score Tracker", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Score Tracker \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/366/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Score Tracker \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/301/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Score Tracker \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/110/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Score Tracker \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/130/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Score Tracker \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/322/137/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>What it is</h2>\n<p>Score Tracker is a Java application that allows you to track the score when playing board games instead of using paper.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>_Once you launch the application, you chose how many players will be playing the board game.\n_You next chose what type of score tracker you would like to use by selecting a game from the list of score trackers from the pop-up menu.\n_Tap the + and - button under each player to add +1 or -1 to their total score\n_You can add a value in the middle to chose how much to add or remove from the player's total.</p>\n<h2>Games supported</h2>\n<p>_Tic tac toe</p>\n<p>_Checkers</p>\n<p>_Backgammon</p>\n<p>_Guess Who?</p>\n<p>_Connect 4</p>\n<p>_Battleships</p>\n<p>_Dots and Boxes</p>\n<p>_Scrabble</p>\n<p>_Monopoly</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built it using Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Creating the interface with the buttons (just kidding, pretty much everything)</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>More JAVA</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intellij-idea\">intellij-idea</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">asus</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/edgxc0yt8h132rn/Score%20Tracker.jar?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/edgxc0yt8h132rn/Score%20Tracker.jar?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on creating an interface for users, and implementing ArrayLists in interesting ways to allow varying UIs depending on what was specified.", "I provided support to my team mates, both technical and emotional.", "I created the generator for a random number between 1 and 6 to simulate a dice rolling, which we din't use because of lack of time, and I worked on the simple score tracking to add a value you input to the general score, as well as debugging.
