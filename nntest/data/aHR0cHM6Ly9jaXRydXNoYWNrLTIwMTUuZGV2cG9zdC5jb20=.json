Thats why we decided to take the Equip Challenge. We thought we could go ahead and develop an app (either iOS or Android) which we've never done before but wanted to do. Plus talking with the Equipo members was really inviting and encouraged us to proceed with their challenge. All in all, a good yet difficult challenge.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A mobile application that creates a network of users to share messages and other files. The important details was that the network would have ben included in a geo-fence. This means that originally, we were aiming to receive a push notification to the mobile device as soon as stepping inside a pre-defined geo-fenced area using ESRI geo-trigger API. This push notification would tell you about potential client.</p>\n<p>Add fiends based on location</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>As a team, we used Xcode and Parse framework to develop an Universal iOS app that is built for the iPhone 5 and above.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We used Xcode to devlop a swift background with a storyboard interface that would allow us to hardcode and do user interaction with the UI.</li>\n<li>We included our Parse Framework</li>\n<li>We went ahead and obtained a devloper's license with Parse to gain access to the online portal and synch our app to their database.</li>\n<li>From the Parse Framework, we adapted with login textfield UI to allow users type into the username and password section of the phone, we well as when making a new account</li>\n<li>After making our account login screen and signup screen, we went ahead and make a single-view scene of a \"ViewTable\" where we could populate the list of friends of the current user. Additionally, we were able to make a \"show\" screen which moved us to a different page in the app that would allow the user to view and add person(s) in the network. </li>\n<li>Then we went ahead and wrote the algorithm with the help of online forums to take the query of friends the current user has and populate it into the \"ViewTable\" where we originally planned to show friends.</li>\n<li>After we were able to make our friends table, we also made a second home screen which was a camera screen where the user could select who they wanted to share an image with.</li>\n<li>One our third main home screen was our messaging field were we would populate our list of messages that the client has recieved. On the top right corner it also allowed for the client to send new messages</li>\n<li>One the new messages screen, the user is allowedto type into two text fields. The first being the subject and the second being the body. These two items would be synced online to a new class with an algorithm we wrote to organize the user message and subject.</li>\n<li>We included a logout button</li>\n<li>We made the add such that if the client doesnt click the logout button, it wont log out. But if the client does press the log out button, the client will have to relog back in.</li>\n<li>Lastly, Parse UI also has a reset password field that will actually send the client a password reset link to their email.

But when you are new to a place or have even been there for a long time how do you know what the people around you are doing? Hence we thought of SPOTNDROP -a social networking site based on location. A user who is new to say Riverside could use our app and get chat feeds categorized based on interests. When you\u2019re new to an area, you want to be able to rapidly connect with people in the area. Being able to create a virtual application where like minded people in an area can talk and interact with each other.</p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>SPOTNDROP is primarily a web application which connects people based on their location. On the web app, a user can see all posts from people within a certain radius of his or her location. If the user desires, he may drop (or post a message) to the feed of a specific location. Our app currently records the name and a text message as a post. However, we wanted to incorporate  additional features like, using data sets to create population clouds where certain conversations could be categorized and let users from areas away from population clouds participate by entering the coordinates of the cloud. But due to lack of time we could not implement the features on to the application.</p>\n<h1>Pebble Extension</h1>\n<p>As a crucial differentiating feature, we incorporated the Pebble watch with the web app. Because people are constantly on the move, it becomes difficult for people to connect on a computer, and for this reason the Pebble brings convenience. Through the SPOTNDROP application, the Pebble is able to display all feeds within a location organized by time. When a new drop has been added to the feed, a notification will pop-up on the Pebble. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>SPOTNDROP consists of 3 unique and different parts; the server; the web client and the pebble client. The server acts as a middleware between the clients and the data.</p>\n<p>The server is the main hub for all of the components of SPOTNDROP. The responsibilities of the server are to store data, receive new drops, and send drops within an area. The server is written in Go, and is hosted by IBM\u2019s Bluemix technology. We are using a MYSQL database and the database is primarily being used to store drops. The server also handles websocket connections from the client and pebble to send and receive updates; the server also handles GET requests from clients for retrieving drops within a specified radius of coordinates. The GET request returns a JSON array of drops given a longitude, latitude, and a radius in kilometers.</p>\n<p>The pebble client is written in javascript. The pebble uses javascript libraries to make JSON data requests from the server; to listen on a websocket connection for updates and various internal libraries for user notification and interaction.</p>\n<p>The third and final component of SPOTNDROP is the web client. The web client allows users to submit drops via a websocket connection, to view preexisting drops via a JSON GET request (the same api call that the pebble uses for its data). The client also features a google map that displays the current GPS position of the user, and displays \u201cpins\u201d for nearby drops. The client also features a \u201cdata\u201d option that enables the user to display important social media data. Currently this data analysis uses machine learning to keep track of \u201chappy\u201d and \u201csad\u201d posts.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>In a project like this you end up running into roadblocks. Finding and creating a connection an online database took us some time. Learning JQuery for pebble was also slightly difficult. But are main challenge was structuring and delivering our data.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SPOTNDROP</h2>\n<p>SPOTNDROP has huge potential. The best thing of such a project is that a product like this has not been launched into the market yet.The UI has to be improved, and we want to automate the categorization of data based on population clouds using machine learning. Thus guaranteeing a manageable amount of categories and not leaving creation of categories to the users. We want to also integrate a voice to text api into our app.\nAs Robert Frost famously said\u201d We have miles to go before we sleep and miles to go before we sleep.\u201d</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://spotndrop.mybluemix.net/#!\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://spotndrop.mybluemix.net/#!\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>spotndrop.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.spotndrop.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.spotndrop.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.spotndrop.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["With idea concept mapping, I helped my team focus on the goal with a structure guide.

To really learn hardware, I decided to dive in the deep end by building a robot from scratch.</p>\n<p>I didn't know that building a robot would be this challenging. Because of my inexperience and the scope of the project, I only got 4 hours of sleep the entire weekend! I had to work constantly to assemble the electronics, code, and hardware myself.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The robot processes accelerometer data and balances on two wheels.  This is MUCH more difficult than it sounds.  </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Every part of the assembly is 3D modeled by me in Onshape CAD software.  I had to wire and assemble the IC's together, and design algorithms that parsed accelerometer data and translated it (with very complicated math!) to roll, pitch, and yaw values.  These values would then go through a PID algorithm to output motor speeds such that the robot can stay balanced on two wheels.</p>\n<p>I had to go to a hardware store to buy the screws and bolts.  Aside from this hardware, I modeled and printed every part.</p>\n<p>Two of my parts wouldn't mold together 2 hours before the deadline.  I had to run to home depot and walmart looking for good super glue and rush back quickly to finish.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>No matter how precise your CAD measurements are, the 3D printer's variability causes the models to print incorrectly.  I had to print over 4 different version of each part until I nailed the exact measurements that make the parts fit.  All this iteration meant staying up and printing all night, both nights.</p>\n<p>Accelerometers only return acceleration values, so calculating for position change is a very difficult math problem.  I had to read up on Madgwick quaternion filter source code to solve this.</p>\n<p>There is also a lot of unexpected friction between the bushings and the gears.  This causes the robot to stall often.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I've never built a hardware hack before!  It was a ridiculous amount of fun.  I want to become a mechanical engineer now o_o</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Everything!  Electronics, c++, 3D printing, modeling.

Along with this realization, our team soon recognized that hackers were often sleeping throughout the day! In the unique environment that a hackathon provides, hackers often stay up all hours of the night, refusing sleep until midday or later. As such, there is consistently a group of hackers with unused sleeping bags as well as a group in dire need of them.

The technologies we used are Bootstrap for styling and markup, jQuery to manage transitions, PHP as our backend language, and Parse.com as our database.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team ran into a plethora of bugs, both minor and major, but out greatest hurdle was figuring out how our users would best benefit from our service. We wanted our service to be free to all, and with that were forced to prioritize convenience and ease of use above all else. As a result, we often took the long way around, coding rough forests of NULL pointers and seas of hidden abstraction to provide our users with the most intuitive interface possible.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Through Hackbag project, we experienced various script languages such as JavaScript, PHP, and Bootstrap. \nAlso, we learned ideas of development can be found around us, since we found our idea from people who do not have a sleeping bag in a nap room. Although we had a hard time working as a team, we learned how to cooperate in the end. Each of our teammates had different knowledge, but we mixed them together and succeeded in making our project Hackbag.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HackBag</h2>\n<p>After developing this basic prototype, we are planning to develop Android and iOS versions of our app. We hope to make this service available to hackers and organizers nationwide. We hope to usher in an age of sound sleep for all!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bfullam/HackBag\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bfullam/HackBag\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://bfullam.github.io/HackBag\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://bfullam.github.io/HackBag\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bfullam.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on the backend PHP functionality, which was a surprise because I've never really used PHP before.

Our vision was that, when users enter a certain location (which we geofence manually or generate), they would be alerted in the app and start building points for being at that location. We envisioned teams fighting for control of buildings, or a single player environment where the player builds points against some boss or monster. Our app didn't end up getting to that stage, but we built a solid framework with a diverse range of technologies. As it is now, we have an app with applications for new UCR students.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app as it now is a map that displays your current location and direction of movement. We've manually geofenced all UCR instructional buildings. If you walk into one of these buildings (which are marked on the map), the app will play an alert tone and update a header which tells you the code of the building as well as the building's full name. A button allows you to recenter the map and full pinch and zoom capabilities are available.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first built a simple app in Android Studio which had a map with no functionality. We then added the current location and direction of movement functionality. Then, we went into the ArcGIS editor and defined the boundaries of each building that we wanted. We then applied the boundaries to a geotrigger service using a script and some intuition. After that, we worked with firebase and heroku to set up a server backend for storing the location. Firebase allowed us to instantly update the displayed building name, adding speed to our app. Our app runs a geotrigger service in the background of the phone, which, when it detects the user has entered the geofence, will send a POST request to our Heroku server URL, which our server (written in node.js) handles and interprets. From the big JSON object that the POST request contains, we parse it and grab the name component which we store in firebase. The Android app constantly listens for changes to database (thanks to the firebase API) and changes the displayed information in the app very quickly.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>-issues with the geotrigger service script\n-gradle not working\n-json parsing\n-going outside to test (made testing difficult and time-consuming)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>WE MADE AN APP FOR THE FIRST TIME</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned basically every technology that we worked with. Especially new to us was the ArcGIS API which we now know fairly well. Traversing the API references gave us a good understanding of it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Orca</h2>\n<p>We plan to extend the app to meet our original game functionality which we intended.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.github.com/rhocode/orca\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.github.com/rhocode/orca\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/rhocode/orca-server\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/rhocode/orca-server\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android app, set up Heroku for use with our server code, tested the app, created ArcGIS boundaries and geotriggers", ""]], ["PebbleSesame", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxB4fb8dUpM?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>So</strong>, whether you've done it, you do it often, or you'll do it in the future; Imagine yourself working on your programming assignment and you are just so concentrated. All your ideas are coming to your head when suddenly, your doorbell rings. Oh no, that means you have to get up, run to your door, at 'worst' case allow the person inside, run back to your room and hope that all your thoughts were intact by the time you get to your chair. If not programming, then picture your favorite hobby being unfavorably interrupted.</p>\n<p>We've all been there; Pebble Sesame is here to help!</p>\n<p>Pebble Sesame: Once your doorbell is pushed, a webcam located in a safe place near your door takes a picture. The picture is then sent to the owner of the Pebble watch. The owner is then able to unlock and lock the door appropriately from their Pebble watch.</p>\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n<p><strong>Raspberry Pi to Pebble Watch</strong>: The button pushed calls fswebcam, which then takes a jpeg image and stores it in the current directory. The image is then converted, compressed, and resized to a png 144x168 gray scaled image to be displayed on the pebble watch. Once it\u2019s converted, it is then uploaded to imgur and the URL of the image is stored in a text file in the current working directory. The URL and the watch notification signal are then sent to an AWS(Amazon Web Service) server that is the center of communication for the entire project. A python script on the server is called that downloads the image from imgur. The pebble watch is listening for a notification and once it hears it, the user is able to see the image taken. Also, it displays text for the user on the screen as part of the notification.</p>\n<p><strong>Pebble Watch to Raspberry Pi</strong>: Once the user receives the notification, Up button on the pebble sends a command to unlock the door, and Down button locks it. The signal sent from the pebble is '1' for unlock and '0' for lock. The signal is sent and stored in the AWS server. The Raspberry Pi is constantly listening for a change in state and once it hears it using UART(universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter), it sends the state data to an Arduino UNO. The arduino then interprets it and controls the servo motor(lock and unlock demo) appropriately.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/servo\">servo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webcam</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">simply.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/anava014/PebbleSesame\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/anava014/PebbleSesame\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Mailbox-Notifier", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mailbox-Notifier \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/084/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Mailbox-Notifier</h1>\n<p>Notifies you when you receive or remove a package!</p>\n<p><em>as done at Citrus Hack 2015!</em></p>\n<h2>The Problem</h2>\n<p>Have you ever been stuck away from home waiting for an important letter such as a credit card or your UCR parking permit?

If mail has been received, the laptop updates a webpage running on a localhost server to let you know that mail has arrived.</p>\n<h4>Other applications</h4>\n<p>While our presentation today is specific to our mailbox, the application can be ported for other purposes that require monitoring if something is physically present or not, for example to make sure that delicious cake is still in your fridge and that your roommate hasn't stolen it... yet...</p>\n<h2>The Team</h2>\n<p>Henry Doan\nJoel Gomez\nKurt Kreeger\nTianbi Zhang (Casper)</p>\n<p>Thanks for using Mailbox Notifier!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/makefile\">makefile</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jgome043/mailbox-notifier\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jgome043/mailbox-notifier\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the hardware choice and the implementation of outputting a notification to a log file.", "I worked on the arduino code for the project", "I worked on developing the program for serial communication on the laptop side of things.

The document camera, while proven to be a milestone in displacing the gap in visual-learning, is underutilized due to cost, lack of familiarity, and inefficiencies when switching between modes (live camera and screen-share). This problem is commonly observed in presentations that need live-demos and onscreen reports. We look to eliminate the third-party device while improving visual-learning with better user-experience and additional features. \nIn addition to what document camera pitches, we offer: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duplicate recordings for sharing</li>\n<li>Live-stream recordings</li>\n<li>One-click mode switch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>What it does:</strong></h2>\n<p>cThru is a tool to increase content clarity and to allow for live-demos and real-time learning. This program, when connected to a monitor/projector, will access and share the video-camera feed. When prompted, the program will record the feed and save file when the program ends. With one click of the button, the user is able to switch between the live-feed camera and the desktop-sharing. This fluid switch will avoid loss of attention. </p>\n<h2><strong>What We've Done:</strong></h2>\n<p>cThru is composed of two primary components: the use of the openCV and the Arduino. The openCV is used to access the camera of the laptop and stream live feed and/or record the feed at the same time. The Arduino uses an analog input to use  on a mount to activate the openCV to access the laptop\u2019s camera\u2019s feed. Although we were not able to combine both platforms due to time limitations, the program works with a few clicks instead of full automation. </p>\n<h2><strong>Challenges:</strong></h2>\n<p>While we were able to complete our design, we were unable to implement all the features we have planned for this project due to a gap in our knowledge about the merging of platforms. During the course of 36 hours, we coded in C#, C++, and Arduino. We had difficulty combining the platforms to allow the usage of the built-in camera of the laptop and the Arduino with our sensors. </p>\n<h2><strong>What's Next:</strong></h2>\n<p>With basic features in place, we believe that cThru is a differentiated product. We will continue executing our envision to ease user experience and make visual-education more affordable for both school administrator and students. </p>\n<p>We look forward to developing these features: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hands-free switching of screen and camera using sensors on the platform.</li>\n<li>Capturing and rendering images. </li>\n<li>Automatic publishing of the lecture to create a virtual classroom.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on designing the concept of its display and cleaning up the CSS.", "", "", ""]], ["VolunteerMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VolunteerMe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/060/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VolunteerMe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/058/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VolunteerMe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/059/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Organizations often need volunteers, but it can be hard both for organizations to find enough volunteers, and for volunteers to quickly find causes that match their schedule and interests.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This web app will allow organizations to post events and tag it with a category, e.g. environment or healthcare.

However, as the direction of the project changed, we instead geared it towards those who were visually impaired. As Mechanical Engineers with little real programming experience, we wanted to make something that may not be extremely sophisticated/difficult, but at least helpful.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using 6 ultrasonic sensors placed around a helmet, sound waves are used to detect nearby objects. Once detected (say a chair to the left of the user), an internal motor vibrates in the direction of that object to give users a feeling of their environment. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We utilized an arduino uno, 6 ultrasonic sensors, a sample helmet to mount the sensors on and small motors within the actual helmet. An arduino sends out a trigger for 6 ultrasonic sensors through a shift register. As we receive information back from the sound wave sent out by the sensor, we utilize that to calculate the distance from the nearest object. If it met some minimum distance criteria, we vibrated an internal motor in the direction of that nearest object. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Because we are mechanical engineers, we were never formally trained in any of the things we used during citrus hack. All we had was a passion and a love for all things electronics related. That being said, we never used or knew about over half of the things we utilized for our project this year. </p>\n<p>Also, as we ran out of pins, we quickly found out that we had to use a shift register. Learning how to use and implement this new IC was incredibly challenging for us as mechanical engineers. In fact, this was the source of all of our confusion in the code and in the actual circuit we built. </p>\n<p>The other challenge was physically making the device. The internally vibrating motors were of very low quality and the leads kept falling off, eventually destroying the motor, by things like their own vibration. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Figuring out a way to mount all of our sensors in an intuitive way as well as being able to interface even a part of our system was really rewarding to us. Learning about the shift register, implementing it, and working with it was also very exciting. In general, we learned so much in the topics of coding, circuit design, and computer engineering in the past 36 hours in order to (attempt) solve an engineering problem for those in need. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>There's several things to note here. First and foremost, how to use a shift register (at least to some extent). Also, we learned the basics of circuits as well as ICs. One of the things I did not expect to learn was how to plan a project which turns out is very important...</p>\n<h2>What's next for Haptic Feed-back for the Blind</h2>\n<p>Really, it's all about showing what mechanical engineers can and should do to leverage the power of electrical, computer and computer science engineering.

We learned a little bit about the nuances of javascript and its benefits and downsides compared to other languages. We learned to adapt the different platforms and conditions that we were limited to.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pebble Calorie Counting WatchApp</h2>\n<p>We would like to be able to allow users more freedom in customization of notifications. We want to provide more phone integration so that users can access more information about their calorie intake.
