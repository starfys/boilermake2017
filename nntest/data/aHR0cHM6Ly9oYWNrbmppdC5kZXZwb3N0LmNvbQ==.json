With so many options it can be difficult to decide where to go eat dinner.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It finds all of the restaurants with in a fixed distance from you, and it randomly selects one of them. The app will mark the restaurant and display information such as address, name, ratings, and whether or not its open.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used geolocation api to find the location of the user. That data was passed off to the google maps api. I developed a query that consisted or the type of establishment that I wanted to request, as well as the range in which to search for the restaurant.</p>\n<p>I used javascript for a bulk of the computing. CSS was used to format certain elements. and HTML was used sparingly to make sure that all of the pieces worked together.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Since I am not experienced in JavaScript (I learned it on friday night), I ran into problems that people with more experience would not have. I had issues with global variables getting erased, I had problems with variables not getting recognized. This was also my first time working with an API. So I did not know how to use it. I had to learn about the API on the fly. This slowed me down considerably. Some of the syntax was difficult to understand since it was relatively advanced, so it took a lot of time to decipher what all of the forums and articles where trying to teach.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Despite all of the frustration, I managed to keep a level head and figured out how APIs worked and how to use java script. I am proud of the fact that I did this project without a team. This is my first semester of being in a computer science student. That decision was more reassuring now that I know that I have what it takes to surmount obstacles and challenges. his was the first significant development project that I have undertaken, and I feel like I did a really good job.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned about APIs, I learned about JavaScript. I also learned a lot about the development process. I learned about the whole development process. I learned about planning out a system, and how to research what tools would be the most helpful in building that system. I also learned about how different languages interpret  code differently. The logic that would be valid in one language, isn't alway valid in another. (This was another problem that I ran into working with JavaScript)</p>\n<h2>What's next for Munchie's Map</h2>\n<p>The next step for Munchie's Map is to allow users to enter address or gps locations and suggest restaurants. Munchie's Map should also expect an update that will allow user to select option such as type of cuisine, range, and price point.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ip-api-com-geolocation\">ip-api.com-geolocation</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ubkk0d591ec6.bp235.koding.io/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ubkk0d591ec6.bp235.koding.io/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ubkk0d591ec6.bp235.koding.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["ShortView", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShortView \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/033/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ShortView \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/320/074/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to know how a system like Linode's Longview monitor works -

The problem is that these photos are less professional than a scanned copy because they are often shot at an angle and sometimes include things other than the document itself, like the table that it was sitting on. That is what prompted me to build an app that would be able to crop such an image and produce output that could not be distinguished from something out of a scanning machine.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app has multiple intended functionality. One way to extract the document from an image is to let the computer do it completely by itself, which involves first detecting the edges and then the prominent lines in the photo. Alternatively, the user can select the vertices of the page, and then let the computer handle the cropping. Either way, the intended output can then be sent via SMS or perhaps uploaded to Dropbox.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using Android Studio and with great advice from the people at Stack Overflow, I was able to resolve most of my issues with setting up the camera and working with bitmaps programatically. Some of the algorithms that I used I was aware of earlier, such as Canny Edge detection and the Hough transform, and others I developed during the course of the hackathon, like the affine transform. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Coming up with a good algorithm is always much faster on paper than actually implementing it. That's why even though the affine transform seems to work in my C++ example, I had trouble with it when I ported it over to Java. Also, the Android camera turns out to be very difficult to use; there is a simple version which returns a small thumbnail and a much harder version that returns a high-resolution image - for the purposes of this hackathon I used a scaled up version of the thumbnail image.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I implemented the edge detection and affine transformation algorithms, even though the second one is buggy in the Java implementation. I was also pleasantly surprised with the performance of the custom view that I used to contain the photograph. It was done entirely programmatically (no XML!) and displayed the images quite well.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Page Scanner</h2>\n<p>Getting it to work 100%, and then utilizing the full capabilities of the camera, and not just the thumbnail that I've been working with so far.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/plempert/page-scanner\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/plempert/page-scanner\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Project Reach", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We all wanted to learn more about VR technology and HackNJIT was the perfect opportunity.
