It doesn't take long to find that too many of our students are <em>aimless</em>, taking courses they <em>don't need</em> or <em>struggling to find a niche</em> in college. </p>\n<p>Simply put the infrastructure at schools has a few problems</p>\n<p><strong>-Too slow</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Doesn't have enough data available about the student</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Can't recommend classes through the portal</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Advisers are over worked with one of highest school populations in history</strong></p>\n<p>And this is hurting the efficiency of our institutions. It's time we fix the neglected problems of the university, course registration and advisement systems.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>Usually in our state universities here in Florida the only guidance you can get is through a text box and a message system, while you wait for a meeting. You send in your concerns and anxieties and then let it fester while you wait for a meeting. Students need more reassurance to make the right decisions. Don't get us started about registration, the huge number of steps to search and refresh and compare classes was shrunk into a easy interface. Just click to add.</p>\n<p>To help out with the load on the advisory system we are implementing the wonders of big data to create insights into what classes should be paired for your course load. We can take multiple sources of data and generate a recommendation score of how it will fit into your schedule and difficulty level. All the while predicting your performance in the classes you want to take and if we underestimate your ability, feel free to prove us wrong :)</p>\n<p><strong>Its academic advisement 2.0</strong></p>\n<h2>Notable Things Used</h2>\n<p>We used <strong>React</strong> for our frontend</p>\n<p><strong>Node.js</strong> for our backend</p>\n<p><strong>R</strong> for our data calculations</p>\n<h2>Technical Nitty-gritty</h2>\n<p><strong>Alastair Paragas</strong> made a back-end takes your transcript data and turns it into data points that we can make inferences about the student. Then we generate a report about this tendency to keep his grades high or has a slight decline. There a bunch of data to crunch so that is why our backend is solid enough to deliver clear JSON to our middleware. </p>\n<p>Once that is completed, multiple statistics tests are done against public university data in order to make a recommendation and a confidence interval to make a proper suggestion, Data Science brought to you by <strong>Krista Shuckerow</strong></p>\n<p>We hand that over to our beautiful React Redux front-end designed by <strong>Alain Galvan</strong> and packaged and shipped to you with care by <strong>Angelo Saraceno</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned React Motion it is a very nice and complete framework. We learned about a bunch of metrics that allow us to rate the quality of education and most of all hearing the stories that people faced in their tribulations at their school from as minor as registering for classes to actual hardships undertaken by under par advisement. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Ellery</h2>\n<p>Implement it at our university and hopefully it can help out with FIU's and Florida's University system be one of the most competitive in the nation. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript\">typescript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/r\">r</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docker\">docker</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webpack</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/elleryapp/ellery-frontend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/elleryapp/ellery-frontend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/elleryapp/ellery-backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/elleryapp/ellery-backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Queu3d", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of our team members works in a 3D printing lab, and the software for managing it right now isn't so awesome.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Scalable remote or local management of massive 3D printing jobs.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Secure and fast.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Makerbot.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Makerbot is not a big fan of developers.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Queu3d</h2>\n<p>Deploying and testing in the lab environment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tornado\">tornado</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://queu3d.space/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://queu3d.space/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>queu3d.space</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the back end and cleaned up the front end a little bit.

Using a Python server, the drone is controlled autonomously based on the GPS location of the end-user and the client pharmacy. Once the UAV arrives at the user's destination, custom hardware drops a small lever on the drone and delivers the prescription medication.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this unique and marketable platform using a Parrot A.R. Drone 2.0 Elite Edition that uses a Python control server reverse-engineered from the provided programming interface. By using the GPS data from the consumers phone, which is sent via the internet to the drone's control server, we were able to navigate the drone autonomously to a given location.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This is easily one of those most involved projects that any of us have had the opportunity to work with. A variety of technical components come together to create a unique yet united platform for the future of drone delivery. It was difficult to interface the drone hardware with a software server, combined with real-time data from the user's smartphone that activated a real dropping mechanism.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully completed the delivery of a prescription drug to a pre-determined location using our platform.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Drone Drop</h2>\n<p>Drone Drop is designed to be implemented by any small business or family-owned pharmacy and is ready for investors to take it to the next level. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">parrot-a.r.-2.0-elite-edition</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pubnub\">pubnub</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dronedrop.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.dronedrop.tech\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dronedrop.tech</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the logo and built the web application for interfacing with the server.

It was also a challenge getting the images to display correctly, due to the layout-less nature of the JLayeredPane I chose.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Overcoming the aforementioned challenges.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I had to learn how to create action listeners with two dimensions of input using reflection. I also learned much more about how to use JLayeredPane. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Get15</h2>\n<p>With more time, I will work on non-core functionality and aesthetic tweaks. An example of the former is automatic loss detection (which I tried and failed to implement today), while the latter would involve some manner of animation during the collapse function. I will also experiment with different schema for random tile generation, and the possibility of smaller or larger challenge grids.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built

this game because of a cool game called Duck Hunt that involves shooting down birds. I am a tower-defense game fan and I decided that I wanted to create my own tower defense game.</p>\n<p>It uses fish models to cause intense dizziness. It has a makeshift gun that is used to shoot down the fish. It offers quite the interesting user experience in a stormy ocean. The game is also quite frightening in that the fish swim really fast around you and you really feel surrounded.</p>\n<p>We ran into several problems. For example, when creating the game, we had a hard time with things like animation, figuring out how to fire projectiles in a straight line, and working with several cameras. </p>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we came in with not so much experience with Unity. When we first realized the app we had in mind wouldn't be so simple, we did have some doubt at times. However we were able to persevere with the help of a mentor Christian. I am very glad that with his help I was able to figure out several things that I had never done such as Collision Detection. At the same time, I am proud of my partner Jeff Pitcairn who managed to figure things out such as circular animation in Unity.</p>\n<p>Both Jeff Pitcairn and I learned a ton about cameras, animation, and vector manipulation. With cameras, we learned how to access the angle, position vector, and other information. With animation, we both learned how to create moving lanes of objects. Finally, we both learned a ton more about the potential that Unity has. In addition, I got to finally learn C# and 3D game development. </p>\n<p>In the future, we definitely have a strong interest in improving this application. Some things that I would like to continue to work on would be making the ammunition fire straight, reduce firing lag, and add in different difficulties for levels. We also think it would be cool to have several other NPCs such as mermaids, narwhals, or swordfish. We of course are also interested in figuring out how to port this application to different app stores such like the windows phone app store and android app store for others to enjoy.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhz1996/Spikes-in-a-Barrel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jhz1996/Spikes-in-a-Barrel\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Microphone Analyzer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When I learned trumpet I had to practice playing notes based on staff position of notes without thinking of the note letters.

As a result <em>economic, political, and social</em> change would overcome several corrupt regimes such as in the case of <strong>Muammar Gaddafi</strong>. Thus, we were inspired to engineer a mobile social network application to connect people live with others around them. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>As a stand-alone mobile social networking app, <em>Lobby</em>, opens up dialogue between users derived from location based chat functionality. That is, interface sent chat messages are sent to any users within a certain radius of the senders geolocation and vice versa. However, if one leaves the client Message Receiving Radius (MRR) and re-enters after a message has been sent, the user's feed will have the option to update on missed geolocation messages.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The Lobby application was designed using MongoDB, a NOSQL database. This database would provide an easy-to-sort and populate table system, featuring API integration capability. These API's provide the communication tool with the server and the server with the client device. Now for every client message sent, it's geolocation and time is stamped, then stored in MongoDB. From there, MongoDB finds users within the geolocation radius from the received message and sends the message to the user interface. Each application provides a unique screen name to keep public anonymity, done through the FaceBook login function.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Some of the many challenges with this app began with the initial concept of finding a users geolocation and generating a geolocation specified messaging system. Meanwhile, this chat must remain open, while updating it's geolocation feature. Aside from geolocation, the sending and receiving of messages was tedious, due to a number of translation errors between languages. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This project consisted of a blend of innovation with theory, to provide the software structure necessary to deliver a time sensitive deliverable. In particular Lobby as a theoretical idea for liberation, became about simply connecting people at all times around them.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This hackathon has taught us several IDE's, languages and services. For example, integrating a facebook login onto a mobile application, while connecting the user's information to a NOSql database. Overall, everyone's use with Node.js was lacking from knowledge, but now subjected to experience.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Lobby Mobile Phone Application</h2>\n<p>The LMA's post-hackathon phase of implementation will focus on incorporating various geolocation chat's with differing radius parameters as well as, a single chat which multi-threads multiple chat types together (e.g. short location, long location, private message). After this application can communicate users in real time over multiple distances, a node system will be added. This system shall generate a geolocation chat room based on a minimum number of users in geolocation diameter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sourcetree</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Damn Daemon", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The name is inspired from the Damn Daniel Vine meme.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It simplifies the tedious tasks needed for developers to deploy their apps as daemons so they're always running.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used a combination of python and bash scripting to effectively speed up as well as simplify the steps to make a daemon with an app on a Linux system.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Damn Daemon</h2>\n<p>More interaction with daemons including logging, start/stop, and more!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.damndaemon.com/damn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.damndaemon.com/damn\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.damndaemon.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Contributed to the Bash and Python code to make up the main scripts."]], ["Inconvenient Chatroom", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Inconvenient Chatroom \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/372/765/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>PartyLord was too inconvenienced to write something</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Inconvenient Chatroom forces the user to use a LeapMotion sensor to write brainfuck code to output a message onto the chatroom.
