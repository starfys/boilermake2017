Taking this to mind as well as the data sets that were <a href=\"http://mhacks8.devpost.com/details/ford\" rel=\"nofollow\">provided</a> to us, we created an application to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Welcome <em>!Safe</em>, a platform to best help you get from Point A --&gt; Point B in the city of Detroit.</p>\n<h2>Explanation</h2>\n<p>Detroit is not a safe city, we all know this, so we began by writing some ML models to help calculate the apparent risk and danger associated with travelling along a certain route. These models are composed with a number of data sets, but at the highest level we mix user related stastics with city crime data, weather data, traffic data, etc. to determine what the potential downsides of travelling amongst a certain path are.</p>\n<p>To effecitvely serve the user, when they input a source and destination in our application we run a probability of this inforamtion through our model and then use this to inform how we will suggest the user to travel. For instance, if there is a significantly high likelihood of crime occuring on a certain street, yet that is the route suggested by Google Maps, we will deviate and reroute the user so that their safety is guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we support a myriad of travel types including Public and Non-Public transport. This means that we can tell you how late your Detroit, public-run, bus will be and then suggest to you a safe place to wait just as well as we can suggest to you the safest &amp; most efficient way to bike || walk || drive through Detroit.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<p>We've included all the code that you should need to be able to run this application for yourself in this repository. To begin, start by cloning this repository and then <code>cd</code> to it.</p>\n<p>Run <code>npm install &amp;&amp; nodemon app.js</code>. You now have our server running and can access the application on <code>localhost:3000</code>. If you want you can try to send some queries to our APIs using Postman. See the section below on the APIs and the sample data you can get in and out.</p>\n<p>The rest should be pretty self-explanatory. If you're reading this you know how something like this would work. Just read through <a href=\"app.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">app.js</a> where the core of the application is defined.</p>\n<h2>API</h2>\n<p>If the type is <code>POST</code> you are expected to provide <code>x-www-form-urlencoded</code> data in a JSON blob. If the type is <code>GET</code> then obviously, you don't need to do anyting :smile:.</p>\n<p><strong>POST</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>/api/doSomeML</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This runs the ML models on the given inputs. </li>\n<li>A sample of what tt expects for you to provide the following in the <code>POST</code> body is shown:\n<code>{visibility: 3.9793469387755103, lat: 42.3422975, long: -83.0591982}</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>/api/nextBus</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This determines whether the location you are at is a valid stop and, if it is, will tell you when the next bus is arriving.</li>\n<li>Sample <code>POST</code> body:\n<code>[[lat, long], [lat, long]]</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>/api/orderUber</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This route will order an UBER to the coordinates given and prepopulate the destination field.</li>\n<li>Sample <code>POST</code> body:\n<code>{[LAT, LONG],[LAT, LONG]}</code></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>/api/putRate</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This route allows one to submit a rating of a stop.

More often than not, when you are going to events, there are other people, similar to you, nearby, who will be taking the same route as you. We wanted to connect people to reduce the cost of travel, growing pollution problems and the burden of traveling all alone, to provide a revolutionary travel experience. Our solution? Tripper.</p>\n<h2>What it does?</h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t just make trips, but make memories instead. Tripper turns your cumbersome trip into an enjoyable journey by connecting you to people who are travelling on the same route as you. You can either use our chat bot or web app to enter your destination and we will find you travel buddies for your journey. The app then lets you chat with your travel buddies to get to know them better before your journey. Additionally the app also determines the safest route for your journey</p>\n<h2>How it works?</h2>\n<p>Our server is written using Node.js and hosted on Linode with a MongoDB as our database. The server can be queried for directions and the server then queries Detroit\u2019s open data portal to optimize the route using crime data to avoid dangerous routes. Our multi-platform web app is written in javascript as well. Our mapping systems are created using arcGIS from Esri, which is what calculates directions for our app. These services interface with our Facebook chat bot and use facebook as an authentication provider. Lastly, our internal chat system is created using Firebase.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Building a great optimization tool required us to dig deep into the apis. Not only we wanted to build a tool that found the crossing paths of many hackers, but also a routeing system that avoids areas that are more dangerous too.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to also build a chat-bot on Facebook that uses AI to converse with the user.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tripper?</h2>\n<p>Expand the web service into a full fledged social network for avid travellers and adventurers. Incorporate crime data from more cities. Work on our AI to the facebook chat bot for the service Suggest itineraries for upcoming trips.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Frontend, worked on route optimization, UI+Logo Design, Server Management ", "Contributed to the server side of the web app and handled API calls", "Contributed to UI/UX and the variety of mascot/emojis derived from the logo.

With a clean UI and a step-by-step UX, we believe DST\u2019s proof of concept could be instrumental in</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clarifying much of the randomness and inconsistency associated with Detroit\u2019s Bus System.</li>\n<li>Providing human feedback and data that will reshape existing busing schedules towards human convenience.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the Ford Go Detroit mission to build an app that helps provide access to safe, efficient, reliable transit for Detroit residents so they can get to their school, work, or other activities securely and on time. We were further inspired by statistics available about students of the Detroit education system who often cannot find reliable transit access to their schools, contributing to nationally low attendance averages and high rates of tardiness.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Detroit School Transit (DST) enables students to take control of their transit schedule. By turning on location tracking during their commute, a transit report is generated to vouch for students who waited at bus stops for late arrivals. DST further enables parents to track their children\u2019s location side-by-side with real-time bus arrival and departure info. Parents can also track the commute and know when their children get to school safely. There is an additional web-based administrative platform to view student transit reports. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>DST is a cross platform service, spanning across both mobile and web.</p>\n<p>We built the student platform as an iOS application. The whole app was designed in a very linear fashion. We used a combination of Swift and Objective C on the Xcode platform to create the front end of the mobile app. For data storage and retrieval, we set up Firebase for our backend. With regards to frameworks, we used Apple\u2019s Core Location and Map Kit modules to track and display user location. The Sketch Image formatting tool was used to create most of the icons and design schematics in the iOS application.</p>\n<p>On the web platform, we coded HTML/CSS/JS. We also linked the Firebase backend to the web front end, and we attempted to sync the data retrieved from mobile users to be displayed on the web page. This is still a work in progress. Additionally, we used Python to parse the provided Detroit bus data which we stored in the form of JSON files.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The data and APIs available about the Detroit transportation system is limited and often incomplete/inaccurate, which made these given resources not completely adequate and reflected a much larger problem of data collection for Detroit transportation.</p>\n<p>This was the first time we coded in Firebase, so being able to understand and then use the service for this the hackathon was definitely an interesting learning curve and a feature that we're proud of. Another obstacle was data parsing. Much of the data we collected came in different forms, from Strings to Time/Dates to Coordinate Locations, so it took a good effort to cast and consolidate a wide range of data into an interpretable form, all the while making sure the meaning of the original data was not compromised with conversion.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of creating a social-impact-driven product that considers the needs of Detroit citizens and the growth of the city overall. We were also happy with the ability to create a cross platform service that, to the best of our abilities, addresses the overall theme of this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>More than anything, we began to delve into the deeper history of Detroit and some of the institutional problems that the local government and citizens have faced in the reconstruction of the city. We often researched beyond the scope of the inherent functionality of our product, but this new knowledge reinforced our drive to contribute. From a technical standpoint, the ability to work with a backend, specifically Firebase, was not something that any of us had experience with. Consequently, learning how to handle such a database while utilizing its data model design tools along with its cross platform features was very exciting.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Detroit Student Transit</h2>\n<p>We have a large scope of new features and capabilities we hope to add to DST, including, but not limited to, fully building out a 'Parent' iOS platform with notifications of safe student arrival, increased connection and stop transfer capability, 'Favorite Routes' for frequent users, PDF report generation from mobile, and a live tracking map. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/shell\">shell</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://detroit-school-transit-administrator-pl.webflow.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://detroit-school-transit-administrator-pl.webflow.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>detroit-school-transit-administrator-pl.webflow.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/john-b-yang/Detroit-Student-Transport\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/john-b-yang/Detroit-Student-Transport\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed and developed DST's administrator web platform and created the wireframes for our iOS UI.", "I worked on the iOS application's front end and back end.

In 2015, 10,265 people died in drunk driving crashes, one every 51 minutes. Drinking and driving is a major problem in the U.S. and we wanted to take action to mitigate its harmful effects.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When a person is driving, we closely monitor steering wheel rotation and acceleration so that if the driver is drunk, our algorithm will detect discrepancies in normal driving patterns. The application will first send the driver a notification that he or she is driving drunk, and if the drunk driving persists, the system will send alerts to the drivers' emergency contacts.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We collected data through General Motor's Next Generation Infotainment SDK using the iOS steering wheel tool that we developed. Here since we don't have actual drunk driving data, we do our best to mimic the driving patterns of a person. Next the data is used to create a machine learning model using Azure Machine Learning which will then be used to detect if a person is drunk from any data we gather in the future. In our user interface, you are able to indicate your emergency contacts as well as working as a test suite for our steering wheel application. Lastly, when we detect that a person is drunk at the wheel, we create a notification in our panel telling them that they shouldn't be driving, as well as notifying their emergency contacts that they are driving while drunk in order to have them try to reach the driver.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble developing our drunk-detection algorithm, and it took several different approaches until we found an effective method.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the look of the user interface, and we are proud of the algorithms we developed.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot more about drunk driving statistics and the magnitude of the issue in modern day society.

These issues make it almost impossible to have a portable on-demand set. So we asked ourselves: \"But what if you could play killer sets that\u2019ll make crowds both large and small go absolutely crazy with a device that can fit in your backpack?\" This is where AirTunes comes in. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Upon running the Hololens app, it first asks you to place a cube about 5 feet away from the Kinect. After this, it projects instruments on the floor around you. You can then chose an instrument and play it. On the top right you have a record button that\u2019ll let you record one bar and loop it. Once you loop one instrument, you can swap it out with another one and play on top of the loop. You can repeat these actions until you have layers of instruments playing on top of each other forming a song. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Both the Kinect and Hololens were built using Unity. The Hololens app was compiled and ran on the Holoens while the Kinect app was ran on another computer. The server was hosted on the cloud and took requests from the Hololens to speak to the Kinect. And vice versa.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We came into this hackathon without any experience of programming the Kinect or Hololens. Neither of us also had any knowledge of C# which is what was used to program the application. The game engine used to build the virtual environment, Unity5, was also a new tool to us which neither of us have used before. So the first challenge was trying to figure out where to even begin and attempting to learn the APIs without knowing the language. After we got passed the language barrier, and figured how the APIs worked, we ran into another challenge. Normally, if you were to run this just on the Hololens, you\u2019d see the instruments and could move the instruments but wouldn\u2019t be able to efficiently interact with them. If you were to run this just on the Kinect, you\u2019d be able to better interact with the instruments but not see them and have to stare at a screen or guess where they are. The biggest challenge was being able to merge these two technologies and use both to efficiently work together and have the best of both worlds.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Having the Hololens communicate with the Kinect via our server.\nSetting the Kinect to recognize our movements to produce sounds.\nHaving our server tell the Kinect which sounds to produce depending on the instrument chosen.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>C#</p>\n<p>Unity</p>\n<p>Hololens API</p>\n<p>Kinect API</p>\n<h2>What's next for AirTunes</h2>\n<p>Further develop the application and reach the following milstones:\nEnable real-time recording for the instruments</p>\n<p>Immediate playback of the recording</p>\n<p>Better Spatial mapping of the environment </p>\n<p>Further refine the skeleton for the Kinect for a more precise control</p>\n<p>Ability to save and share your sets</p>\n<p>More instruments!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-hololens\">microsoft-hololens</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked on Kinect side of things and helped develop the C# scripts for the Kinect.

Despite its far-reaching impact, AI has never felt less accessible. It seems like somewhere in the process of beating Go, captioning our images, and driving autonomous vehicles, AI has paradoxically lost its human touch. We want to bring that connection back in a way that fosters creativity and recognizes the strengths of both man and machine. We believe that something as powerful as AI should have a soul and, most importantly, expand human souls.  We want to empower music producers, artists and enthusiasts, giving them access to an entire orchestra of artificial agents to compose, create and improvise music. Rather than using AI to replace human talent, we see this as a means to augment and supercharge existing human facilities and intuition, allowing human composers to reach creative heights that were never possible before, both through real-time improvisational cues and procedurally generated sonic compositions. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We have built an AI orchestra, capable of improvising musical pieces in real time, inspiring and adapting to the humans it is playing with, and generating completely new songs based on its experience. We organized these three capabilities under two distinct pipelines within our platform. </p>\n<p>Ad Hoc improvisation and procedural generation is accomplished through our Neural Pipeline. The pipeline itself is driven by two different models. One consists of a character generating Recurrent Neural Network, capable of reading audio MIDI files and learning their structure. This network can then generate creative pieces on the piano, violin, cello, and trumpets. The songs we created sound both euphonic and aggressive, very different from what a normal human would compose. After seeing these results, we became very interested about what networks designed by actual music theorists can do. This caused us to also incorporate elements of <a href=\"www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hexahedria\u2019s Biaxial Recurrent Network</a> within our pipeline. This model explicitly learns pieces by using music theory and multiple recurrence dimensions (temporal and note spaces) to generate beautiful music. Those results made us very excited, thinking about the different kinds of music that different AI architectures can create. </p>\n<p>Real-time adaptive playing is accomplished through the Improvisational Pipeline. This consists of an Arduino and two microphones (one from a set of Apple ear pods) mounted to a classical violin, which pick up the notes being played on our violin. We isolate these notes by sampling based on the beat. The note itself is determined by running a Fast Fourier Transform on the signal received and then extracting the most prominent frequency (a note is essentially a particular frequency). Finally, these extracted notes are mapped to new notes based on Music Theory, using concepts such as the pentatonic scale, perfect fourths, etc.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>This project made extensive use of the WolframAPI and Mathematica, mainly to convert signals from the violin to midi files. We also use Mathematica to output the processed notes as various instruments in our improvisational pipeline. Finally, our Neural Pipeline took advantage of the variety and abundance of built-in instruments within Mathematica to generate distinct sound profiles for our orchestral compositions with the RNN.</p>\n<p>The Neural module was built in tensor-flow, making extensive use of the RNN modules that were available then. The char-rnn architecture used to compose some of the songs takes into input textualized MIDI files and processes them through 2 hidden layers. After the training process, the network is able to generate textualized MIDI data, which then can be converted into actual music through the Wolfram API.  The biaxial RNN consisted of two vertical stacks of LSTM-RNN nodes who were interconnected, the note and time networks, each with two hidden layers. The input would consist of a vector consisting a vector\u2019s MIDI note alongside some information on the note\u2019s vicinity and the history of notes played. The input would then be passed through a vanilla recurrent time axis, in order to learn some structure. Then, the output of the time network would be passed to the note axis, who makes recurrent connections alongside other Note nodes. This ensures that the network is able to learn connections between different notes and their relationship to each other throughout multiple musical pieces</p>\n<p>The Improvisational pipeline was powered by digital signal processing. The fundamental technique in digital signal processing is the Fast Fourier Transform, a <strong>O(n log n)</strong> algorithm that is incredibly versatile in its scope and application. In our project, it allowed us to filter different notes just through their frequencies. Since FFTs are just something that the three Computer Science majors in the group had studied in theory until that point, it was incredible to see its power when implementing it to build our application.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Even in our demos, lag consistently hampered our efforts to sound euphonic. The best way we found to mitigate this was timing the delay so that it is always behind by a factor of the beats per minute of the violin composition. This is a fundamental limit in all sampling based approaches and requires a more sophisticated predictive model to completely eliminate.</p>\n<p>The neural networks also had issues. The most basic one was training time since the neural networks took 10 hours to train on all of our datasets. The most crucial challenge was out of our hands though. We had several problems in making the char-RNN learn musical structure, as it would often play awkward combination of notes, spend large amounts of time not playing anything and then compressing dozens of notes in a few seconds. More training epochs helped remediate this problem, but the architecture still needs better forms of representing musical structure in order to be more effective.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Hardware \u2013 we literally hacked hardware to make it bend to our whims and needs for this project. Our hardware wizard (Azra) spent an incredible amount of time working with microphones and signals </p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence \u2013 we had very little experience with non\u2013traditional neural network architectures, especially exotic ones like the double weaved biaxial recurrent neural network used by Hexahedria. This project enabled us to understand how small architectural changes in neural nets can produce gigantic differences on a network\u2019s output.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Neural Nets take forever to train and it\u2019s hard to predict their behavior after training.

Such a system operates under the premise that the best type of healthcare system is one in which illness prevention is promoted so that necessity for treatment is minimized. This results in a higher quality of life for patients, drastically reduced costs, and a generally more efficient treatment process.\nNoting this trend and the necessity to help patients avoid needing to be admitted/re-admitted into hospitals, we sought to tackle the stem of the issue: unhealthy, and hard to brake, habits that lead to patient ailments.\nFrom personal experiences and much research into work being done in behavioral economics and its application to the healthcare sector, we realized that it would be much easier for patients to adhere to small, daily, goals rather than larger, seemingly drastic ones, and that these little goals, when created properly, could be the factor that allows patients to overcome their unhealthy habits. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mogenio provides an online personal health coach to patients of all ages and backgrounds, wherever and whenever they may need it. </p>\n<p>After signing in, patients have the option to choose 1-3 health goals that they want to work on: exercise, nutrition, and/or sleep. Patients will then be redirected to a custom-made survey specific to the goal(s) they are interested in that will ask questions to get a better sense of each user\u2019s current habits and lifestyle. </p>\n<p>Each user will then be matched with a personalized list of small health coals to focus on, as pulled from our backend database. These goals will be displayed on our mobile user interface (UI), and on the backend will be given general \u201ceasiness\u201d and \u201ceffectiveness\u2019 scores. </p>\n<p>Patients could self-report their adherence to these goals through clicking and dragging each activity to \u201cdone\u201d or \u201cphysically can/will not do\u201d. By default, if a goal for a given day is not dragged to the \u201cdone\u201d category, it will be considered not completed. </p>\n<p>As users complete a given type of activity, that activity\u2019s easiness score gets progressively higher and its effectiveness score gets progressively lower until a particular healthy activity is completed for a period of two consecutive weeks, at which point it becomes considered a habit.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>To build our hack, we made use of three main different technologies: Parse, Azure, and React. Parse was used on the back-end to create and store our database of different healthy habits. This data was then exported to Azure, which was the server we used, and again exported into and outputted by our UI in a way that was consistent with the survey responses for each user. The smooth interaction between our backend databases and front-end was accomplished through the use of React. </p>\n<p>After each step towards creation of a habit is completed, we ask for user feedback on the ease of the task.  This data is used along with previous results to determine ease and effectiveness scores for each habit for a given user. In order to recalculate these values, we an added statistical scaling parameter generated by finding the Taylor series of the entire dataset around the point in question, and displacing the ease parameter by a second order term of this data from ease, and the effectiveness by a second order effectiveness term and third order ease term.  These parameters are used to rank the steps for each user by addition in quadrature in order to bias against steps that have unusually large values in either parameter.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This hack required the use of many different languages/technologies in such a way that they were able to effectively communicate and transfer data amongst each other. Such an endeavor required that we develop proficiency in these different technologies in an extremely short time and also understand how all this different tech can be designed to interact and build of one another, making this aspect of the project particularly challenging for us.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>In our end product, we were able to build an application that makes use of three extremely powerful technologies in harmony. This task was unbelievable difficult in executing to the level we accepted for our project, and we cannot be prouder of this accomplishment. </p>\n<p>Most importantly, however, we are proud that the product we created could be used by patients for years to come in getting rid of their unhealthy habits, developing healthy ones, and improving their standard, and cost effectiveness, of care. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Projects always seem to appear simpler than they seem, but once the hacking starts, it seems like there are always unexpected hurtles that must be overcome. While we expected to be able to relatively smoothly and simply development our hack throughout the weekend, we soon realized that we took on a much larger tasks than expected, having to make use of more technologies, and in a more complex manner, than expected. For next time, however, we have learned how to better streamline the development process. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Mogenio</h2>\n<p>In the future, Mogenio seeks to expand its model to helping people break poor habits of all types such as procrastination and rapid loss of attention. We want t o become an all inclusive resource for all people to come to for help in leading happy, healthier, lives. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sugataa/mhacks8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sugataa/mhacks8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed the data model and populated the mongo database.

Generally, managers have to project their Gantt chart creation system, like microsoft Project on the board, and go through the tedious process of manipulating them manually.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>My idea is to create these Gantt charts automatically, just by having a system listening to the meeting, and transcribing it.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built this project with python and NLTK. I use syntax parsing: once the speech (individual sentences) is parsed, the system looks for pairs of regular and subordinate clauses with subordinators like \"before\", \"after\", etc to determine the relative priority of the tasks in each clause. It then assigns each task a priority level, and outputs an html file with (as of yet, unpolished) list indented based on priority.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge I ran into was creating a grammar that was complex and expansive enough to capture the the notion of relative priority of clauses. It took a while, but eventually I figured that a reasonable way to split up a sentence was into clauses. Another challenge I ran into was to expand the lexicon to include a very large set of english words; I ended up finding a pos-tagged dictionary online, and updating the terminal grammar rules (such as N -&gt; 'fox').</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm really happy I was able to complete this project; I've been wanting to do it for a while. Definitely my project has limitations, but I'm proud that I was able to, in pretty much half a day, figure out how to capture the concept of relative priority from language. I think that this field wil be one of the most important going forward: giving computers real human-like understanding of textual data, and I'm really excited.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This was the second time I had used parsing on a project. I developed a sense for how to construct grammars iteratively and make them more complex. I also looked into statistical parsing derived from text; it worked, but the grammars which resulted were too complex to use for this project.</p>\n<h2>What's next for scrivener.ai</h2>\n<p>There are many ways to go next, including</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of relative priority, have a clear idea of inter-task dependencies</li>\n<li>Add the concept of timelines and relative dates</li>\n<li>Improve the parsing using statistical parsing, and expanding the allowable grammar as much as possible</li>\n<li>Use machine learning to, given extracted clauses / tasks, help determine the relationships between them</li>\n<li>Lemmatize / stem the words</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And much much more.

How do you prepare for it? I look around at those in Detroit who actively look for more positions everyday. More importantly how do you prepare when you may not have the resources like mock interviews. So I thought why do your own mock interview and have computers analyze it for you.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Innerview records your answers to each common interview questions. After each answer it gives you a summary of how well you did. Specifically about how sentimental you were or how many filler words did you use? On top of that it lists topics in your answer. Were you consistent in a topic or jumping around?</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used Microsoft's amazing Cognitive Services. So much of the amazing machine learning could be access through API calls. On top of the API calls I used android as the platform to integrate these calls. Which by default gives me access to resources such as microphones and cameras. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The API calls were tricky to configure. Android also had multiple compatibility issues with the different libraries. I had to constantly change the targetSDK which also meant I changed which UI resources were available. The mess was recursively building. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Finding something I never expected to really be all that interested in. I barely slept because I was always so excited to get the next feature in. Also building a app always is a great accomplishment in my book.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about how API calls work and how to efficiently call them to share mobile resources better.  There was also a lot I learned about permissions and how a lot of them changed in newer Android versions. Also I learned a lot about Microsoft as a company because I never realized how much software they've developed beyond just the famous Windows we see everyday. </p>\n<h2>What's next for InnerView</h2>\n<p>Currently InnerView is a speaking app, but it can expand into a visual realm where it analyzes speech and your body language and facial emotion. Microsoft has more APIs for these as well and bringing them all together provides a continuous and easy development in one system. InnerView can also provide more suggestions to improve, there can be extra criterions to determine this.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-emotion-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-bing-speech-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-text-analytics</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Amerterasu/Inner-View\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Amerterasu/Inner-View\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["AlarmClock", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the Meridian Health Plan challenge to create a way for people to take their medication regularly.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This clock helps users time their medications, so as not to overdose or forget their pills</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Arduino Uno and an LCD screen to make the clock.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had moments where we didn't understand why our code was not working.

With this in mind, drivers are cognizant of when and where it is or is not wise to make a stop.  Additionally, SafeRoute takes several input streams such as low fuel level, low tire pressure, etc. into account and informs the driver when it is safest to make a stop.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built SafeRoute primarily on the GM SDK.  By using Detroit Open Data statistics of all the reported crime events within the city as our data set, we were able to interpret the data with a custom algorithm designed to determine the relative safety of an area in Detroit.  The GM SDK gave us access to variables that would otherwise cause the driver to make a stop such as low tire pressure or fuel.  Depending on the relative safety of an area, the algorithm asserts whether it is smart to make a stop or not.  We used the Google Maps API to display a graph, plot the current position of the car, and act as a base for the heat map overlay.  SafeRoute uses a caching system which fetches crime data daily in order to reduce system lag, and mitigate the need for constant high-speed internet access.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Encountered some issues communicating between the GM SDK and the Google Maps API when trying to automate plotting locations</li>\n<li>Our algorithm was initially very inefficient and caused the system to hang</li>\n<li>Distributing tasks amongst the team</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We created a product that has the ability to add value to many people's lives in Detroit</li>\n<li>Having learnt how to use a new development platform</li>\n<li>Having accomplished more than what we originally set out to do</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Effective allocation of tasks </li>\n<li>Effective communication as a small software dev team</li>\n<li>How to go about learning how to use a new development environment quickly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for SafeRoute</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add functionality for point to point navigation</li>\n<li>Increase algorithm efficiency to reduce lag</li>\n<li>Complete offline functionality with cached maps</li>\n<li>Seasonal analysis of trends</li>\n<li>More cities</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/UnknownArcher/SafeRoute\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/UnknownArcher/SafeRoute\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the frontend integration of Google Maps with crime data.", "I worked on the frontend in general, developed the UI, and set up the test and demo scenarios", "I worked on visualizing the data using the heat map, caching data for offline usage, optimizing the program for performance, and the general code structure.

Long wait lines, they're everywhere, concerts, buses, trains, games etc. People today, living in these fast paced hectic times, struggle to find a way around them and inevitably end up wasting a lot of time. So what our app does is, it stops the wait for you and those around you. Instead of spamming you with mails sending you QR codes, we use your face as the ticket. So, no more wait lines, no more forgetting tickets, struggling to find appropriate mails, just the plain and simple face.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Smartpass uses facial and speech recognition to enable a simple photograph and a spoken keyword to be the entry pass of an individual. The confidence interval for facial recognition is at 80% which guarantees a complete match, below which the speech text recognition comes into play. The user while filling out the form for the ticket, is asked to upload a URL of a photo of themselves, their name and a keyword chosen by them for the speech text recognition. The applications of this range from public transportation to potentially even healthcare as it makes the process of recognition of an individual efficient and easier.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Each of us took up a specific task: Daksh took up the Cognitive API services and backend dev, I worked on the front end HTML and CSS, Cassidy worked on iOS app dev, and Christopher worked on testing of speech and facial recognition, and decided on the decision boundary values based on the tests.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Image conversion to send it through octet-stream</li>\n<li>Deciding whether to make the API calls from JS or Python</li>\n<li>Making HTTP requests to backend from iOS</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Everything about the project, because it's something completely new for each one of us. It is a way through which we are able to create an impact in society through something we love. And also because we're awesome and MHacks is awesome.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Pretty much we everything did was new. Hence, each of us learned an entirely new field that we were unfamiliar with before. I for one had no coding experience prior to this and hence learnt to work on the front-end over these 36 hours.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Smartpass</h2>\n<p>Let's see if people liked our idea and if so then expand to include more sectors under smartpass.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-app-engine\">google-app-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">swift3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/speechapi\">speechapi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">audiokit</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/caffeine\">caffeine</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/TeamTurtle/SmartPass\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/TeamTurtle/SmartPass\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://smartpass-145909.appspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://smartpass-145909.appspot.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>smartpass-145909.appspot.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked with Microsoft's cognitive API in JavaScript to use machine learning to identify people who registered for a specific event, after which, I worked on developing the back-end using Google App Engine, and created a small database to store data on the users and events created.", "I developed the iOS app; it was my first time making HTTP requests, so working with Microsoft's FaceAPI to identify users was quite the adventure.

Did someone steal it and turn off the wifi/ remove the SIM card and thought they got away?</p>\n<p>Well, not anymore!  Echo is an app that makes sure your phone and your data is YOUR phone and YOUR data. </p>\n<h2>What It Does</h2>\n<p>Echo allows you to set-up certain \u201ctriggers\u201d on your phone so that the phone knows when it isn\u2019t in a good spot.  A few examples of these triggers could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When your phone isn\u2019t connected to your home WiFi for more than 5 hours. </li>\n<li>When your phone is outside the University campus for more than 2 hours.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, that the phone knows it\u2019s a bad spot, it automatically sets up a WiFi Hotspot with a certain Unique ID. Example : ECHO$12921</p>\n<p>Now, as other Echo users walk by, their phone\u2019s periodically scan for other phones in potential danger. The instant their phone picks up a lost phone\u2019s hotshot, it sends off the GPS data of the phone to a server hosted on Linode (an incredibly fast and stable cloud host that I absolutely love.)</p>\n<p>You could also log in to the web-portal and see real-time stats about your phone such as location with timestamps. All without being directly connected to your phone in any way.</p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>Front-End: HTML, CSS, Javascript, PhoneGap\nBack-End: PHP, Apache, Linux, Linode</p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>The biggest problem we faced was getting the back-rnd set up and running as none of us had any experience in that area. Fortunately, with so many resources such as mentors and the Internet, we picked it up and got everything running pretty fast! </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments We Are Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that, despite the fact that we all came into the hackathon not knowing much about back-end,  we made such huge progress in such a short amount of time,  learning all the various languages and APIs available for back-end programming.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>It doesn't matter how much you know about programming, all that matters is the passion and tenacity to be driven to keep learning no matter how daunting the challenge may seem!  </p>\n<p>You don't have to be afraid to ask others for help!  We owe a lot to the friendliness and patience of the mentors and fellow coders for teaching us a thing or two about back-end!</p>\n<p>USE VERSION CONTROL!  As we were new to working in group projects, we used absolutely no version control(does CTRL+Z count?). This caused us to run into many problems as we went through the project.</p>\n<p>Lastly,  we learnt that we never know how much we\u2019re truly capable until we push ourselves and this hackathon did exactly that. </p>\n<h2>What's Next For Echo</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduce proximity/strength of WiFi signals to give a more accurate approximation of the location of the phone</li>\n<li>Implement timestamps to provide an extra dimensional variable which will be really useful for moving (stolen) phones</li>\n<li>Introduce command flushing to all the phones in a certain radius, so the user of the lost phone can set up commands to be sent to his phone on the website. The next time his phone would come near another phone with the app, they would automatically connect and the user's instructions would be run. (For example : Wipe all data, Record Audio)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tasker</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phonegap\">phonegap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">githib</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/theRoughCode/Echo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/theRoughCode/Echo\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote all the code for the  mobile app, the front-end and the back-end.

Safeglass solves both problems. It presents important information from crime statistics to parking locations, and does so in an intuitive way.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SafeGlass is a cohesive platform, spanning multiple devices, that makes travel safer and more efficient by analyzing crime and population statistics, as well as regional landmarks.</p>\n<p>The Google Glass component is the most significant part of this ecosystem, tracking the head movements of the wearer to create an augmented reality interface. It can aid a driver in finding local parking spots to ease traffic congestion, as well as detecting when a driver is feeling drowsy. It can help pedestrians steer clear of areas within a city that have higher frequency of crime, and direct them to safer locations by leveraging Amazon Alexa voice commands. All these functionalities are connected to a server that analyzes data and makes calculations in real time.</p>\n<p>The platform isn't just an assortment of helpful apps; it's a proof of concept that Google Glass can be at the center of an ecosystem of related applications, communicating with the same server, that help reduce the complexity of city travel. As technology like Glass eventually becomes cheaper, it will become much more viable for mainstream use.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We hosted a server on Amazon EC2 that could handle requests from multiple sources. The Google Glass activity uses the internal gyroscope and magnetic field detector to detect the wearer's orientation and location, and projects relevant information about the user's current activity (walking or driving) in the style of unobtrusive AR.</p>\n<p>We also used Amazon's Alexa to create a voice interface with the main server, providing information about which areas and neighborhoods are safest in the user's vicinity. This data comes from Detroit Police Department crime reports, which are parsed and analyzed based on their proximity, recency, and severity (as determined by a sentiment analysis algorithm). This data is also accessible through a map visualizer that works on desktop and iOS, powered by Esri's mapping tools and based on ArcGIS data structures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gosafeglass.com/backend.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">Architecture:</a></p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We struggled to incorporate the large DPD records into our app, so we figured out a way to sift through the data and find the crime reports that were the most relevant to the user. The AR setup on the Google Glass was also difficult to calibrate and perfect, because there aren't many AR applications of Glass.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made a lot of progress during the 36 hours, and still managed to get a few hours of sleep. We worked on multiple pieces of hardware, and multiple operating systems and devices.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>ArcGIS data and Esri map visualization, Google Glass development, and parsing huge datasets.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SafeGlass</h2>\n<p>Enable more devices (like Apple Watch, iPad, Pebble, etc.) to work on the server, and apply data analysis and AR to solve more problems related to transportation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/alexa\">alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-glass\">google-glass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://gosafeglass.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gosafeglass.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gosafeglass.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on data visualization, ArcGIS data setup, and landing page", "Wrote Java code for Google Glass Augmented Reality component of the application, and built backend architecture for data processing of Ford's dataset"]], ["From for iOS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>From</h1>\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\n<p>Whenever you pursue a large goal, research shows that you will do better if you work with a partner or team.

We set our target as those who have the willing to recover but forget to take medicines on time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Like our logo suggests, what it does is to finish the last step of therapies, which is to let the patients take the medicines after doctors prescribe them. More specifically, it combines the feedbacks from the doctor and the patient to provide synthesized information for the patient. Doctors and patients are registered in different identities in our online system. All the information is stalled in Firebase database. When certain medicine is prescribed, the doctor need to log in to input the symptoms, the prescribed medicines, and the time to take medicine. Then, the system will send notification to the patient's phone through the iOS app. Also, the patient can log in through their app to get more detailed information. Immediately after the patient takes the medicine, he or she should check the corresponding 'yes' on the app so that the system will know the execution effect.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our system can be divided into three parts, namely, the website, the database and the iOS app.We first\ncome up with a design of the website, which contains information of patients and can be logged in by both\npatients and doctors. Then, it occurs to us that we need a data base so that we can store the account of \npatients and doctors and the information of patients. This data base, then will be reached by the app so \nthat it can encourage the patients to take medicine ontime. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Solving errors caused by different versions of softwares.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Four of us did not have much experience in developing iOS app. However, we managed to make an app after three days of hard study.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to develop website, database and iOS app, and also how to combine them together. Besides, never put coffee near laptops, especially when I lack sleep, even if the \nspace is limited.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mhacare</h2>\n<p>We would like to further diversify the functions of the iOS app. Also, we are considering to develop the Android and pebble watch version to meet the needs of larger audience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://kongfanzhong.github.io/Mhacare/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://kongfanzhong.github.io/Mhacare/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>kongfanzhong.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["ParkGreen - Encouraging Detroit to Carpool", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkGreen - Encouraging Detroit to Carpool \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/128/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>start</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkGreen - Encouraging Detroit to Carpool \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/528/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>start screen</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkGreen - Encouraging Detroit to Carpool \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/526/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>drivers screen with drivers code (no passenger)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkGreen - Encouraging Detroit to Carpool \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/527/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>onboarding screen passenger (enters driver code here)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkGreen - Encouraging Detroit to Carpool \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/676/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>drivers screen with passanger (button to claim parking spot)</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ParkGreen - Encouraging Detroit to Carpool \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/678/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>drivers screen: claim parking spot</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Inspired by the goDetroit challenge, we wanted to create a app which would  incentivize people to do more car sharing, which leads to means fewer cars, less traffic and more parking spots.</p>\n<p>People, who carpool are allowed to park in dedicated GREEN parking spots on the street, which the city of Detroit provides.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The App monitors the car sharing process.

It not only tracks the user's location in real-time and plots multiple routes of travel from an origin to destination point, but also serves as a data visualization platform, mapping a neighborhood's crime history and providing markers to the nearest safespace.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The front-end was built with basic HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. We primarily used two API's: Google Maps to plot data points and determine routing, and Facebook to access and connect user data. The backend was built on Flask and Gunicorn, and hosted on a combination of AWS and Microsoft Azure. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Let's build a data analytics app with intelligent path-finding! <em>10 hours later</em> Let's build a buddy system with Facebook integration!

Paired with dozens of inner-city schools closing due to a lack of funding and underperforming test scores, a lack of substantial public transit puts some of the most threatened communities into a self-replicating cycle of poverty and miseducation as they continue to travel further and further to find schools or jobs.</p>\n<p>Our team was particularly inspired by the user story of an inner city student going to school. We drew from personal experiences of riding a public bus alone for the first time, and recognized the jarring differences between our stories and those of a middle school commuter traveling over two hours to attend their nearest school. We felt especially privileged, because despite how anxious we once were, our bus systems did not loop through some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the country, especially through neighborhoods of high drug and gang violence. From there, we brainstormed Bus Buddies, because no child should ever feel afraid while pursuing an education.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Bus Buddies is a public safety geolocation mobile app that generates a \u201csafest route\u201d by comparing bus routes against areas of high crime. It lets the user communicate with friends, family, and an emergency dispatcher if they are in distress. \nThe user identifies their point of origin and a destination, which the app\u2019s algorithm uses to plan a course that circumvents areas of high crime. The app continually monitors the user\u2019s location in 10 minute bursts. In the event that the user is endangered, tapping the \u2018alert\u2019 button located on the lower half of the screen sends a SMS message detailing a specific geoposition to the predetermined \u201cbuddies.\u201d The profile is then also sent to the emergency dispatch service, who will call the phone and proceed with further action.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Ionic to build the client-facing application in a ecosystem and convert it down to their respective native builds. The authentication server and database are built using MySQL as the database, Node as the server, and Sequelize as an ORM. We used Twilio\u2019s API to send the text messages to the buddy\u2019s given phone number.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our team pivoted frameworks multiple times. Initially, we intended to develop the app on Swift, but one of our team members was running a Windows machine, making XCode not a viable option. We then spent about four hours learning React Native for its cross-device portability and began developing the components in React Native, but because no one on the team was familiar with React Native, it was very much like the blind leading the blind. A mentor saw our frustration and suggested we try a GUI framework, Ionic, which proved to be the most successful because it\u2019s built on top of Angular.js, and Patrick was already familiar with Angular.</p>\n<p>We also had a hard time choosing a server to store username and password caches on. The initial plan was to use Firebase because we believed its authentication process paired well with React Native. However, after deciding against using React Native, we were still on the market for a new infrastructure. We initially considered MongoD, but ultimately decided on MySQL. This was because we needed fast database aggregation functions in order to quickly compute heuristic availability, and SQL aggregations are faster than Mongo\u2019s by a factor of twenty-five.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>None of us have experience developing mobile apps, so finishing with a MVP is a real MVP in our eyes.</p>\n<p>Pat - Learning to rapidly switch operational models in an incredibly fast-paced environment. Also learning mobile development with no prior experience whatsoever @_@</p>\n<p>Fiona - I joined the team as a beginner hacker with little to no experience in programming. Patrick and Yidi took me under their wing and taught me what GitHub was and walked me through hundreds of lines of Javascript and React Native.

You do not have to bring the ruler or spend time measuring the dimensions of your room to make sure that the new furniture could fit in. You could just pick up your phone and scan so that size will be automatically recorded.\nSize comparison:\nMost importantly, the matching function helps you compare the size of different products to see if the size match one another.

The app will subsequently inform them of safe areas nearby to take shelter in. </p>\n<p>If a user has a complaint that they would like to file, we have a form that easily allows them to do so without the hassle of maneuvering through the Detroit transit website. The data from the form is efficiently stored in a spreadsheet. </p>\n<p>We have Facebook functionality that allows users of the Detroit transit system to discuss the issues facing their City. This would allow like-minded citizens to mobilize and bring about positive change in the community. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We built the project using the ionic framework, which allows for hybrid native and web development on the iOS and Android mobile platforms. </p>\n<p>For server side data storage, we used Zapier with the Google Sheets tool. \nFor location data, we used the Google Maps API. \nFor Facebook integration, we used the Facebook API. \nTo identify crime ridden areas, we ran a python script that would allow us to identify troublesome locations by performing analysis on the data obtained from the data.detroitmi.gov website. </p>\n<h2>Reflections:</h2>\n<p>Arsala: Submitting the form data using back-end server side development was very challenging, especially since I was completely new to it. I had dabbled with php in the past but this was a completely new beast to tackle. I tried php and node.js, but being a complete newbie, it was a monumental task to post the data and then store it. </p>\n<p>Luckily, a mentor helped me out by telling me about Zapier. It solved all my problems and even allowed for the data to be stored wonderfully using Google sheets. </p>\n<p>Jon &amp; Jeffrey: The bus journey to MHacks was the first time we ever programmed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We were put in charge in the design, logo and tab switching functionality. </p>\n<p>Santiago: I tackled the Maps portion of the project. Our scope of functionality was very ambitious, and after we learned of the API's limitations, we managed our scope accordingly. I learned a lot about how the API works and how complex the navigation and location architectures are. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/zapier\">zapier</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SantiagoOrdonez/MHacksProject\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SantiagoOrdonez/MHacksProject\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the UI", "", "", ""]], ["Met.ro: An Alternative Bus Ticketing Service", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Met.ro: An Alternative Bus Ticketing Service \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/796/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Choosing bus ticket dates, fare types</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Met.ro: An Alternative Bus Ticketing Service \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/797/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Viewing the ticket</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Met.ro: An Alternative Bus Ticketing Service \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/920/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Persistent notification that lets you contact the authorities quickly and discretely</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanting to do a worthwhile project while at MHacks, Varun and Cheenar looked into the opportunities that Ford and other sponsors offered on improving Detroit. While looking at some of Ford's starting tips, they  were inspired by the idea of having a streamlined ticket service along with simple yet effective safety aspirations. </p>\n<p>After that, Cheenar personally wanted to do some type of web-based application and Varun wanted to further explore Android. In the end, the two merged their specialties to create  Met.ro </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Right now, the projects lets registered users \"purchase\" fares, view tickets, and send safety alerts to the police or family members. The tickets themselves have built in timers and associated QR codes that can be scanned and relevant and useful information can be pulled and manipulated. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The back-end is a Node instance that supplies REST end-points to manipulate a MySQL database. The front-end is written in Java as a native Android application. The node instance is hosted on a Linode server (thank you! local hosting was not working, this project wouldn't have been possible without that free credit).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Of the many challenges, the two biggest were getting a product together and merging the code. Varun and Cheenar went off on their own and wrote separate modules that, while disconnected, were a pain to compile into the final application. Some issues with the Android layout system took a while to debug but were very rewarding to overcome. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to create something that has some potential use in a rather short amount of time. It was also our first time working together in a team to create a project, rather than individually. This presented it's own challenges, but it was very rewarding to see our work come together and DO something. This was our first time at a hackathon, and our first time working with much of the software that we used, so to be able to develop a full-stack application was very rewarding and something we are very proud of.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned NodeJS, MySQL, NPM Modules, and Android development. We also learned about focus, intents, and services. Initially, we tried to do everything and ended up with a jumbled, disconnected mess. But, thanks to advice from mentors and others, we were able to focus and get our core functionality working, which was the most important part.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Met.ro</h2>\n<p>We will definitely include smart bus data that would give you contextualized alerts for when to purchase tickets or when you're nearby a bus station. From there, we will continue to integrate DDOT data and expand the app's functionality by including other modes of transportation around Detroit.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cheenar/MHacks-8-met.ro\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cheenar/MHacks-8-met.ro\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MasqedMarauder/EmergencyLocator\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/MasqedMarauder/EmergencyLocator\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["My primary job was configuring the entire back-end to connect the database to our REST end-points.

Maybe one day you found out that you don't have the correct screwdriver when you're fixing your closet, or maybe your fridge went down late at night with full stock of meat nowhere to store. Everyone will meet urgent or awkward situations where a simple help from someone nearby will save the day. Most importantly, making the neighbourhood a merrier place to live in will also be a boost for your own happiness. Therefore we built this platform which everyone could use to interact with people within their neighbourhood.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Once registered into the platform, users will be assigned with credits that they will use to \"trade\" when they send or accept requests. Everyone is allowed to send requests, e.g., borrowing items, asking for extra care for your pet, anything that someone nearby will be able, and easy to reach out. The request will be sent to other users within a certain range to the request sender. This is done by managing users' locations and managing the distances. Other users who recieve the request will be able to choose to accept or decline the request, but in most cases the requests could be dealt in less than 5 minutes. The credit system is set to make sure that everyone contributes to the neighbourhood.</p>\n<p>*Note: Because there isn't a back-end server, the functions can only be tested by changing different accounts.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The front-end is a html web app using Google Maps API to manage users' locations. We have attempted to build a back-end server using Ruby on Rails, but didn't manage to make it work. The final product will be the complete front-end website with a mock back-end using local storage.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The four of us are totally inexperienced in web app development so everything are learnt and created on site. The learning process is the largest challenge, especially for the Ruby on Rails back-end, which didn't get to work.\nAlso, we had a wide range of APIs to choose from, and a lot time was spent on comparing APIs and planning on our project</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of what we have accomplished, building a web app from zero experience and knowledge. Though the back-end didn't work for us but we believe that we are already close to success.</p>\n<h2>What's next for EZHelp</h2>\n<p>There is a large space of improvement for EZHelp, the algorithm could be optimised, the credit system could be improved, and user experience could also be improved through the interface. Also, a mobile app could be applied for this platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Connect", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Connect \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/235/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Translation technology is ubiquitous. Understanding English Chinese, French, etc. is simply a Google Search away. However, one language is left out - sign language. There doesn't exist any mainstream technology to convert sign language to a spoken language. As 3D Cameras, such as the Kinect and Intel RealSense get more and more popular, computer vision becomes increasingly easier. It is very likely that sign language translation will become mainstream in the near future.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We want to envision translation technology that will be readily available in the future. We built \"Connect\", a Windows Application that can convert American Sign Language to English in real-time!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Microsoft Kinect to mine high-quality, infrared data from a video. We used a 3rd party API (Convex Hull) to draw contours around hands. We then used our own computer vision algorithm to track the hand movement and to distinguish between signs. We then fed the data to Microsoft Azure for machine learning using a multi-class neural network.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>It was incredibly difficult to install any software due to the poor wifi :( but unfortunately we were able to get it done in time. Apart from that, it was difficult to differentiate/delimit sign movements.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We did all of this without knowing anything about computer vision or the Kinect as a two person team.

Similarly, its unique feature is that it utilizes the geolocation of the app user and provides push notifications to users about the events happening under the radius of 10 miles. </p>\n<p>Just imagine a scenario where you are walking through a certain area and sudden hear a gunshot from somewhere. Firstly, you would try to keep yourself safe and escape from that area. Then, you can quickly access the CrowdSource app and by just speaking about the scenario you can inform other app users and report about the event. Depending on the text analytics and Google\u2019s geolocation, the app pins the location of the event and informs the audience. Also, it has an additional feature to tag photos as well. This way it not just creates public awareness but can actually help save lives and reduce any sort of casualties. </p>\n<p>This app can be used to report any kind of event from an accident to a music concert or even a hackathon event. It is all about public awareness. You get the latest news happening-in near your location faster than CNN, FOX News or any other media. All that is required is just your voice or some descriptions.

After talking about VR one night, we decided we wanted to do something with Google Cardboard, since it incorporated Android with VR. We decided that social media was a relatively novel idea to incorporate with these field, as people love to share the things that make them unique.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>In mFrame, users are mainly defined by their rooms. Each user has a room that they can customize with pictures hanging on the walls, as well as defining the wallpaper, ceiling, and floor. From there, you can go to other people's rooms to see how they've set theirs up, and follow ones you like for quick access. mFrame's overarching goal is to allow people to express themselves in an entirely new way through the use of VR.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>During our brainstorming, we came across <a href=\"http://www.aframe.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">A-Frame.io</a>. This framework gives access to 3d objects as HTML elements, as well as hosting VR in the browser. Because of this, we were able to make mFrame multi-platform with ease. Silas mainly worked on front-end, setting up and drawing the rooms from user data, and Michael worked on the back-end of room data storage and social networking. We used <a href=\"https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hackathon Starter</a> as a simple shell for our initial account creation and website layout, and we used Pug as an HTML pre-processor. Our back-end runs on Node.js, Express.js, and mongoDB.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Neither of us were very fluent in JavaScript, or at integrating JavaScript with HTML/Pug, so we ran into trouble with getting data from some of our JavaScript, especially since A-Frame is relatively new and low on documentation. A-Frame objects behave slightly differently than regular HTML objects, which provided challenge as well. Some data we expected to be available from A-Frame objects was not actually available, causing us to have to cut features, such as dragging images around a room. \nIn terms of back-end challenges, we had difficulty in keeping all of the route controllers straight, and managing the responses from our database requests. This, compounded with the issues of getting data in to our HTML, slowed our process.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>At the beginning of the project, we developed the front-end and the back-end independently. When we merged the two it worked on the first attempt, which was awesome for us to be able to enter the VR room early on in development. We also managed to host the app early on, allowing some friends to help us beta test. We are very proud of the depth that we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time, especially in VR development, a field of development that appears on the surface to be very difficult to get into.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>A major takeaway from working on mFrame was learning the steps for developing full stack, as well as specific skills with A-Frame, Pug, and mongoDB. We also learned the importance of planning ahead, as we brainstormed and researched for multiple weeks beforehand. Without that planning we most likely would not have gotten a working app, or at least not one with all the features that we were able to accomplish.</p>\n<h2>What's next for mFrame</h2>\n<p>For short-term goals, we have not spent much time on the design of the website so we will update the theme to look less mundane and to be more navigable. Additionally some minor bugs have shown up at various points that we can fix.\nLong-term, there are multiple features we could add. Rearranging images has been something we've wanted to do from the start, but we've been unsuccessful in implementing it through A-Frame so far. This is a major goal for the future. With this, we would also like to be able to have rooms with more images, and maybe scale said images to other sizes. Navigating to other rooms without leaving VR is something we also think would be amazing to add, but this is a far-off goal, as the challenges faced would be very difficult.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">aframe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/molmsted98/mframe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/molmsted98/mframe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://mfra.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mfra.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mfra.me</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on mostly backend, using Express.js and mongoDB.

Once we figured out how the vive would interface with the environment we needed to take a picture with the front facing camera with the vive. Once we had the picture of the real world we used the cloudsite api to use computer vision to tell us what the main object of the picture was. Once we had that data we could dynamically create an object that the api gave and placed that into the scene. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Unity web services are not very friendly for post requests. When we went to go send the picture to the cloudsite api it couldn't get the encoding correct. So we had to get creative and execute command prompt commands to cURL the website to send the data. Again, nothing is easy and unity doesn't really like to do that as well so we had to write the command we wanted to run to a batch file and execute that when we need to.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This is the first time we have used any api in a hackathon and relied on other services to do computation for us. It took some work to get it usable for each time we take a picture with the vive but we got it all working. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>VR is always challenging but rewarding once you get it working. The things that we can do in 36 hours in VR are pretty crazy in terms of how humans react to what we have made. If we had more time to work on these things then we could really make something that could change the world.</p>\n<h2>What's next for VVoRld</h2>\n<p>We came into the hackathon and wanted to take a picture of a chair on the floor and be able to sit on that in vr.

It wasn't as easy as it looked.</p>\n<h2>I ran into conceptual challenges</h2>\n<p>Otjher hackers could often see me waving vaguely in the air, trying to picture the concepts and the mapping of memory and the GPU clock cycle etc. of the Gameboy original. I was left almost worshiping the brave souls who completed Nintendo 64 emulators.</p>\n<h2>As cliche as it is, I am proud that I started this journey</h2>\n<p>I learned that much code looks easy, but that's because it's been given time, effort, and experience. This, by all means, was an endeavor to do in 36 hours, but it was one which taught me the value of scope. Either I needed to find a perfect mentor, gain 2 more teammates, or pivot the project into something doable to complete a functional piece.</p>\n<p>I decided to stick with the tried and true I tried it, but now I need to sleep, so I'll learn from it instead.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pi Boy</h2>\n<p>If I feel inspired after I sleep, I'll devote some time to the project on my own and complete it.

We quickly learned that there a lot of great places to check out in the city, but there also a few that are good to avoid. This is the same with all major cities including Detroit. Popular navigation apps such as Google Maps do not take the safety of the directions into account. We wanted to build an application to help people find the safest ways to get around Detroit.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SafeNav uses Esri Arcgis to get directions and map data. A user enters the destination they want to go to and Esri Arcgisreturns waypoints for that route. We then go through the waypoints and filter them down to consist of a list of waypoints that are &gt; .15 miles apart. Our algorithm then checks the remaining waypoints against the Socrata City of Detroit Crime database. It does so by querying the api for violent crimes within a .15 mile radius at the current time of the day. Based off the results of the crime query, there was a second request to Esri to get a new set of directions excluding those waypoints with the highest crime rates. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>SafeNav is an Android application with a Flask backend. None of the team had experience writing API's so we took time researching possibilities. After looking at Django, Flask and Rails we decided that Flask would be the quickest to implement and did not need some of the more robust features of Rails and Django. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were two main challenges we had. One of the challenges was learning how to develop a REST API. From deciding on what platform fits our needs to how figuring out how routes are created then how to deploy that code. The biggest challenge was trying to develop an algorithm over the weekend that could factor crime data into directions. We spent much of our time trying to decide on how to find where the areas of high crime on the route were as well as how to find a safer route.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of getting an API running on flask that was able to do everything we wanted it to. Coming into the weekend with no experience with API development this was a great success for the team. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>At MHacks there were a few big lessons we learned. The first was that planning is important. We waited until the second day to decide on using Flask for the API. Another thing we learned was the structure and function of REST APIs. Coming into MHacks the team had experience interacting with APIs but never creating them. This gave us a different perspective of the challenges and architecture decisions that go into creating a REST service that have a major impact on all client applications.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SafeNav</h2>\n<p>The next step for SafeNav would be to continue to refine the routing algorithm. We would also look to develop iOS and web applications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SafeNavDev/SafeNav2.0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SafeNavDev/SafeNav2.0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ryanrampage1/SafeNavDetroit-Android\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ryanrampage1/SafeNavDetroit-Android\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I primarily contributed to the back end of the software, building the logic for filtering out unnecessary path nodes, parsing large datasets, and making calls to ArcGIS and SODA API endpoints.", "", ""]], ["OPTECH", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>js;jdjsa</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for OPTECH</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/maxvwalbert/MHacks8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/maxvwalbert/MHacks8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["ParkMe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I plugged in things into other things, cried a bit, cried some more, and somehow we had a circuit!

You'll earn (or lose) points based on how smoothly you accelerate, brake, turn, and whether or not you use your seat belt and headlights properly. All these points add up to an overall score that will tell you how good you are at driving. However, that's not all- you can compete with friends and neighbors by comparing your scores on the leaderboard. </p>\n<h2>How We Built It</h2>\n<p>We used CSS, HTML, Javascript, General Motor's API, Photoshop, and Firebase. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges we ran into was our unfamiliarity with CSS. However, after attending a web design workshop hosted by MHacks, we gained a much better understanding of it and were able to use it to make our final product much more aesthetically pleasing. Another challenge that we faced was learning how to use General Motor's API (ngi sdk), since it was our first time working with it. Learning how to use Firebase was also a challenge, but in the end we were able to successfully incorporate it into our project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments That We're Proud Of</h2>\n<p>We were really proud to have learned more about a new and incredibly exciting API from General Motors. We also learned a lot about CSS and JavaScript, which we will now be able to better utilize in future products.</p>\n<h2>What We Learned</h2>\n<p>We specifically learned more about formatting using CSS and writing functions with JavaScript. We were also able to learn a lot about General Motors' API after the many hours we spent working with it.</p>\n<h2>What's Next for Joyride</h2>\n<p>The next possible step for Joyride would be to expand on Joyride's functionality to include more data from more sensors to better assess how good of a driver someone is. These algorithms and scores could possibly be used for car insurance companies and customers to calculate fair rates for insurance.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Detroit SafeWalk", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the speech at the opening ceremony about using our skills to help those in Detroit. We were excited to see the <a href=\"data.detroitmi.gov\" rel=\"nofollow\">wealth of data on Detroit</a>. We decided to combine the data of non-motorized routes in Detroit and the data of previous crimes. We want parents to know that their kids can safely walk to school.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Through the data, it creates a weighted heat map of all previous crimes in Detroit and combines that with a map of all non-motorized routes through Detroit. Using this, users can find what the safest walking route is from one point to another, based on the heat map and existing routes.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used Android Studio. Using the data online, we turned that into usable data to convert to a weighted heat map, by using the latitude and longitude already available online and by weighting each point based on the category of the crime, using our own weighting system. Combining that with our non-motorized routes, we used the google maps api to give users the combination of the nonmotorized routes and heatmap to use for their travels.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>We had trouble figuring out how to use the google maps api to find the safest route, so we instead displayed all walking routes with the heat map. We also had trouble transferring code between computers because of differing api and sdk.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>This is our first time using Android Development, and we took on a very ambitious project, so we are proud of all the progress we made, even if it didn't turn out like what we first had in mind.

We also learned about the difficulties of implementing other APIs in our code.

MYO Muscle tracks an individual\u2019s progress in muscle strength over time, and communicates this information to the patients in real-time.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Muscular dystrophy affects more than 50 thousand people in the United States. Arthritis affects 40 million people. And men and women begin to lose muscle just after age 30, causing many of them to experience pain by their elder years. For those who suffer from muscle ailments, getting up from bed is difficult. Visiting their doctors in order to constantly monitor their progress is both physically exhausting and incredibly costly. For doctors, it becomes difficult to prescribe various treatments for these muscle ailments and identify which treatments are more effective than others, especially when it becomes infeasible for doctor and patient to meet on a short-term basis. Through MYO Muscle, we provide a unique method of allowing for patients to monitor their own progression and growth when it comes to muscular growth.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>MYO Muscle employs the MYO Armband, a wearable-tech device that can measure the strength of electrical impulses in order to accurately predict muscle strength. The adjustable armband grips comfortably on one\u2019s arms or legs and avoids the hassle of connecting electrodes to one\u2019s body in order to gather data. The user must engage in a simple resistance exercise that provides information about a certain muscle group. For example, gripping a bottle as tight as possible helps the app approximate forearm strength. The app collects 2400 data points from the 8 sensors over the 3 second time period of the test. It then presents the average of this data on a graph along with the other averages from the past to help the user visualize his or her progress over time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The application was built for Android devices, and therefore we built the majority of it using JAVA. Through JAVA, we built the UI, which guides the user through connecting the application to the MYO Armband via Bluetooth. We utilized an open-source project from Nicola Corti that output the raw data from the electric signal sensors on the MYO Armband to the application. We then created a database where we stored all the information gathered and used SQL to request information from it to present to the user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Managing to connect the Armband and our application through Bluetooth proved to be one of the most challenging and frustrating tasks along with properly organizing the data and pulling it from the database.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are quite proud that we managed to fully integrate the MYO Armband with our application, and make sense of the raw data that was output. Initially, the data was completely unstructured, but by testing the output of all the sensors from the Armband, we were able to understand what each data point that it output represented.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>From a software development aspect, we learned that creating apps that interact with hardware is much harder than it looks. While initially we thought that simply taking sensor data would be easy, and portioned less time towards it than we should have.</p>\n<p>From the experience, we learned that sometimes, all it takes is a little luck and one event to go your way to get you going. Even though we felt really low after spending multiple hours dealing with bugs, the moment we saw that our armband was transmitting data properly, the feeling of exhilaration and positivity was amazing.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we were truly happy that we found a use for the MYO hardware that would positively impact people\u2019s lives. Aiding people in coping with their ailments, even in the smallest of ways, brings about positive change in this world.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BtpPrograms/MHacks8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/BtpPrograms/MHacks8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on integrating the database with the graphing tools in the app. Also researched the mechanics of the Myo armband and implemented the code used to measure muscle strength.", "Worked on the backend, with an emphasis on designing and implementing our database and data abstraction schemes.", "Worked on the UI and debugging of some hardware issues.", ""]], ["Until After", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I don't know about you, but personally, I have a lot of cool ideas and honestly just crazy  thoughts that I think of but would never say out loud.

We were interested in hacking with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/glass/start/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Glass</a>, something you don't get to play with on any occasion. Combined with the heavy Ford presence at MHacks, we found <a href=\"http://openxcplatform.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenXC</a> - a car measurement system. The culmination of all these factors resulted in _ jons car _.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>'jons car' takes information from the car in real time while being driven. Then, it displays important information on the Google Glass - a relationship that wasn't so easy to build. jons car displays metrics ranging from speed to distance from important traffic and construction events in Detroit pulled from <a href=\"http://metrotraffic.org/LocalTraffic/Detroit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Total Traffic Data</a>. Some of these stats aren't so obvious from the dash!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>'jons car' has many different parts working together, most of which we've never worked with before. First, OpenXC takes the data from the car. This required a hardware unit that needed to be plugged into the car. Luckily, any car from 2008 or newer is compatible. The unit required us to flash a custom firmware. Next, we use an android application to get the data from the hardware unit over Bluetooth. The android application then pushes the data up to Firebase. Finally, the Google Glass pulls the data off Firebase and renders it for the user. It was our first time even touching car data, Google Glass, and Android Studio.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were originally going to use the Target API, but we had trouble gaining access over the first night, so we moved on to something more exciting - cars! Besides our unfamiliarity, we ran into a few roadblocks and setbacks along the way. Firstly, the Google Glass did not connect to MHacks WiFi, so we had to work around that during development. We weren't aware of the need for a hardware unit for our car until almost halfway through the hackathon, but luckily the Ford representatives were able to pull one out of their backpack. Then, the publicly available firmware for the device did not give us all the information we needed, so we worked with Ford to obtain the developer firmware. Our car was almost towed. Lastly, we weren't able to get much driving time because we were stuck in the Detroit Masonic Temple from 6 pm to 6 am. It was a lot for only two people.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We hacked a car! But what we're most proud of is being able to produce something even with how inexperienced we are. We came in as two freshmen at their first hackathon, and one of us barely making it in time. We were proud when we could read the demo vehicle data onto an android application. We were excited when we could even push the simulated vehicle data to Firebase. And we were amazed when we started to see real data from our car show up right in front of our eyes. Even this devpost.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how fun hackathons can be when you find something completely new and interesting and work at it. We learned technologies like Google Glass and Android Development. We interfaced with a car. We gained skills like pair programming when one of our computers didn't work :( And we got to drive around Detroit.</p>\n<h2>What's next for jons car</h2>\n<p>Although Google Glass isn't a consumer product and might not be any time soon, we got to keep the OpenXC hardware, so we are excited to continue hacking on cars in the future! Rumor has it someone close to us at the University of Illinois has a Glass, so maybe this isn't the last of jons car. Either way, the jons car team came out of this with a plethora of new skills and experiences. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-glass\">google-glass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ford\">ford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/openxc\">openxc</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fye712/JonsCarGlass\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fye712/JonsCarGlass\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/fye712/JonsCarAndroid\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/fye712/JonsCarAndroid\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Ice cream maker 9000", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We came to Mhacks as a team to compete, have fun, and learn.

Many people have to travel often for business and we believe that in order to make travel as enjoyable as possible, there is much room for improvement with current travel technology.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our project uses the Google Glass and many of Microsoft's Cognitive APIs to create live assistance in many different travel areas. Most notably, our project uses Microsoft's OCR API and Translator API to read signs and posters in unknown languages them and translate them in real-time for the user. Also, if the user is unsure of how certain words are pronounced, we use Google's text-to-speech functionality to read out loud such words. FInally we developed a live subititle feature for when you ahve to talk to someone speaking another language.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our project on Android Studio and used the aforementioned APIs to fuel many of our core processes such as text recognition, language detection and translation, and object detection. To take pictures of objects/text of interest, we used a constant photo feed with a high frame rate and took snapshots when the user taps the side of the glass. This would trigger our program to take a snapshot and process that using a mix of some APIs and our own code. Based on the outcome of these processes, we would display relevant information to the console of the glass itself. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There are several challenges that we ran into. First and foremost, the Google Glass could not connect to MHacksGuest because of some port incompatibilities. This gave us a lot of starting trouble because we were unable to even see whether our code was working until the last day of hacking. Also, since the Glass has to run on Android 4.4, we had to use older documentations to use several standard Android features which were not always easy to find. Also, since the Glass' camera has a very different resolution when compared to most Android products, adjusting our image gathering parameters for the Glass was a very long process that needed to be done before any analysis could be tried and executed in the rest of our project. All in all, there were several roadblocks along the way, but we all learned a great deal from them. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud for successfully hacking on the Glass for the first time. None of us have ever used this hardware before and though it was difficult to use initially, we are proud of the work we were able to produce given our level of experience. Also, we are proud for effectively using Microsoft's powerful APIs in our project to help speed up and optimize our I/O.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned quite a lot from this project. Aside from all of us learning a great deal about the Google Glass and Microsoft's Cognitive APIs, for many of us, this was our first time ever coding in Java, let alone Android. This whole experience was very educational and we are all happy with the knowledge we were able to take away from using the Glass and Microsoft's Cognitive APIs. </p>\n<h2>What's next for mhacks-fall-2016</h2>\n<p>We hope to continue to work further with the Google Glass and Augmented Reality in general. It is a field that we are all greatly interested in and something that we would enjoy working on further in the future years to come. Thank you for checking out our project, and we hope you enjoy what you see! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-glass\">google-glass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/J0Nreynolds/mhacks-fall-2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/J0Nreynolds/mhacks-fall-2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["<h1>Hello World</h1>", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt; \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/627/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>concept layout</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Hello World was an app inspired by the idea of understanding the world around us more efficiently.

By forgetting to take medication, people put their health in serious danger. We at Adherence are determined to put an end to this growing problem and to help numerous people from Detroit, America and the world pay attention to this issue.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our Android app allowing users to retrieve prescription data directly from the doctor's office while incorporating elements to further persuade users to take medication in a timely manner. The physician, after logging into the app, enters the patient's name, email address and prescription data. The patient can also login to retrieve the data so that they can view their prescription details. Additionally, the app also send users a notification when it is time to take the medication.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The core app is built on <em>Android Studio</em> with the UI allowing doctors to add prescriptions and patients to view them. These prescriptions are then stored onto a firebase database where more information can be added and retrieved. The purpose of the <em>NotificationCompat.Builder</em> is to send a notification to the users phone regarding prescriptions through the firebase console.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We first tried to use the <em>Google Calendar API</em> instead of the <em>NotificationCompat.Builder API</em>. The issue we came across was that we were not able to obtain authorised access to the full API due to some technical error. We then realised that the <em>NotificationCompat.Builder</em> would allow more flexibility with our notifications and would additionally allow us to bypass the error.</p>\n<p>One issue we are still faced with, in regards to the notifications, is that we were not able to make the notifications appear at specific times and, therefore, we have to use the firebase console every time we want to send a notification to the phone. We are confident that given more time, it would not be too tough of a task to enable scheduled notifications.</p>\n<p>Another issue we came across was when deciding whether to make use of relational vs non-relation databases. We chose to use non-relational databases because our data consisted of a patient with many attributes. The format of JSON that is used by non-relational databases (Where only the first child node is accessible) seemed to offer us a perfect fit to organize the data but later on we considered that relational databases would have been better to manage multiple prescriptions for each person. Since none of our members were familiar with working with databases (it was our first time in fact), we were not able to implement it properly but were still able to store and retrieve data in spite of an error in the values of the retrieved data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our app ensures that the patient has to put in the least amount of effort to be reminded of his prescriptions. After all, in order to successfully influence them to take their medication, we must see to it that users will not have to put significant effort into reminding themselves. This along with our bonus feature ideas would definitely achieve our intended result: to reduce the number of deaths and casualties due to poor medical adherence.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team consists of two freshman at the University of Michigan AA and two non-CS masters students studying at McMaster University and University of Illinois Chicago. Therefore, the entire process was a great learning experience as we learned to make a functional Android application while employing the use of notifications and databases. Through the challenges, we exercised our problem solving skills and our ability to pivot our ideas in order to implement them as effectively as possible. We also learned the features integral to a successful application which were simplicity, reliability and functionality.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Adherence</h2>\n<p>Our first step would be to correct the errors in our code (notifications and database) to make sure the app functions smoothly. Next, we would polish the UI of the app and brainstorm/implement additional features which influence the user to take prescriptions on time. Once our app is is ready for use, we aim to create partnerships with hospitals and health insurance firms to be able to implement our app effectively. Upon initiation into the market, marketing strategies would be vital to spread the information about our app to potential users and hospitals.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">notificationcompat.builder</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/marwaybs/MhacksHealthApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/marwaybs/MhacksHealthApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on NotificationsCompat.Builder API for Android Studio using Firebase.\nTried using Google Calendar API.", "Worked to develop the UI of the Android application as well as troubleshoot issues in the NotificationsCompat.Builder API and firebase database.

With safety and security being part of our nature, as well as driving part of our nurture, we decided to create a safety system which uses an iOS car tracker app.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The system allows the 'driver', the user driving the car, to setup up an account. Where on the car's console they are able to control who they allow they track them; this is done through a two-key authetication progress where a token is sent to a user to track the driver. The user who obtains the token, the 'guardian', is able to track the movement's of the car through a mobile app. In this case, we created an iOS app to demostrate the features the guardian has. For example, while able to see the exact geographic location on a map, they are able to add a boundary over the map so that once the child drives past the boundary the guardian is alerted with a push notification. Like the boundary, there is also a 'curfew' time that could be set, and if the driver is out past that time, the guardian would again recieve a notification. As of now, at any time, either of the users on either end can diable whether they want to be tracked by a guardian/track a driver.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We separated our hack into its 3 parts. The first was the iOS app that was the guardian. We built the iOS app using the Esri GIS api. The second was the driver (vehicle) side, where we were able to get the realtime GPS coordinates that would be sent to the guardian. The final was the server that collected and decided what info to send to either of the first two parts of the hack.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We wanted to implement so many more ideas into this hack, but couldn't get around to doing all of them because they were too complex for the limited amount of time we had to build this project.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Our whole project, but in particular getting to work on Esri in an iOS mobile app, and getting realtime live data from a General Motors console unit (emulator) which had various sets of datapoints which we could have implemented into our project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>You have to plan out everything you want to do.

This is beneficial for when resources are limited, such as space or funding.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Many of the challenges happened at the low-level. For example, trying to find where Linux stores the pixel data that gets displayed to the touchscreen. From there, there were other challenges such as sending that data wirelessly. Not to mention getting click data to be sent to the test bench.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The single thing the group is the most proud of is getting low-level access to the test bench, allowing us to do projects and tasks that others could not. We are also proud of bringing all of this together to create a project that, in the future, help others develop for GM.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot in this project. A range of from low-level embedded Linux all the way up to networking using JavaScript was covered in this project. </p>\n<h2>What's next for GM Remote Dev</h2>\n<p>This solution has much that can be built upon. For example, less latency in the video stream would make the development experience more pleasent.<br/>\nHopefully, remote development on the test bench will be available for other Hackathons in Mich</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wayland</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.example.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.example.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.example.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Pew", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pew \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/948/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>username selection</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pew \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/949/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>main gui</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We had been thinking for a long time about the state of laser tag, and how it currently sucks. Really expensive games, bad matchmaking, arcades only, and many more. We decided that it would be a good idea to build our own laser tag with IR and Arduino. We then experienced 20 straight hours of technical limitations, roadblocks, and incompatibility.  With 16 hours left, we decided to scale our idea back, and instead of using physical sensors, using GPS and the compass to approximate shooting, which is where we are now.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The game is simple - point in the direction of another person playing the game and press \"fire\". You should know if you got a hit or not by the sound effects.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Bing Maps for most of the main interface and target display. To calculate hits, we used the distance formula and some trignometry (operating on GPS and compass data).</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The initial challenge we had was getting the Arduino to work properly with the IR blaster. The library we were using was simply incompatible with the Arduino we had (the 101), so we swapped them out for Arduino Unos. There, the problem only persisted - IR data sending / receiving was either really inaccurate or nonfunctional. After we pivoted to the mobile only based game, we still had some challenges, most of them being the accuracy of GPS and compass data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud that we actually finished after spending 20 hours on something that was unreliable (which we wouldn't use). We're also proud of the architecture of the game server, which is designed in such a way that there is a possibility to add more games that use the same data in the future.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about Arduino, the both of us being total beginners when we started the project. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Pew</h2>\n<p>Game joining based on location is next on the list of improvements, along with some security fixes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/handlebars-js\">handlebars.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://pew.tdr.moe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pew.tdr.moe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pew.tdr.moe</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on communication and client-server sync (WebSockets between node and vanilla JS)", "Made the project structure, interaction with Bing APIs, hit tracking algorithim, and game + account abstraction layers."]], ["Ocupado", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Ocupado \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/244/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The Hacker Board and button.

We wanted to leverage the capabilities of existing systems of cellular networks to make this possible. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>To solve this problem we have come up with a personal assistant which lets you do a lot of things like setting reminders, location-based suggestions, answers to your queries ranging from the solution of mathematical equations to the nearest fuel station, and the best part - <strong>All of this is offline!</strong> Also, on top of it, we are making cross-platform <strong>offline payments</strong> possible through ultrasonic waves. </p>\n<p>This solution requires the most basic hardware in a device (only a speaker and microphone) and is feasible in situations where there is no internet connection. A best use case is making payments between a retailer and customer offline and doing communication during a natural disaster when there is no network.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>There are two parts of our hack:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An offline, SMS-based personal assistant</li>\n<li>Sharing data across all nearby devices via gestures and messaging app in stock android <strong>without using any extra hardware or cellular networks.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The offline SMS- based query search engine is similar to a virtual assistant which sends responses to the user using our search API backed by powerful platforms like Wolfram and Target. The app is made by extending the existing messenger of stock android. So, <strong>no need to install any separate app!</strong> </p>\n<p>Sharing data is made possible by using Audio waves, specifically - <strong>Ultrasonic waves</strong>, which can carry data efficiently and are inaudible to human ears, the best use case is offline payments. These audio waves are processed and made suitable for transmission using Fourier transform algorithm in Java. The security of data is ensured by using <strong>TOTP</strong> (Time-based One time password) mechanism.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Utilising existing resources and the modulation and demodulation of audio waves efficiently was a big challenge for us, along with the security while transmitting the data. Since, we extended the stock android messaging app, diving into the code and modifying it was another blockhead. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were successfully able to demonstrate the use case of offline payments in the application and made a virtual assistant that works completely offline. The two apps are combined via native android messaging app so use will not have to download any external application. \nOur payment solution works even when both the mobile devices are in <strong>Airplane Mode</strong>.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the use of Fourier transforms in processing the Audio signals along with the use CRC algorithms which\nmaintain the integrity of data being transmitted. We explored the APIs of Target and Wolfram to improve the quality of our personal assistant's responses. Most importantly, we learned how data can be transmitted without a network connection and external hardware, which can be helpful in providing internet access in developing and underdeveloped countries.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Offlow</h2>\n<p>We are looking forward to extend the offline data transfer to images and videos as well using Audio or Wifi Signals without using a network connection. Larger payloads would need to be chunked across several error corrected packets, which requires client and server support for it. We can experiment to find the range of frequencies that can reliably be transmitted and recorded. A wider range means more chunk bits, which directly impacts throughput. We are also looking forward to make a automated voice based personal assistant (Off-siri) utilizing the toll free calling capabilities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/brainbreaker/offlow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/brainbreaker/offlow\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/satwikkansal/offlow\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/satwikkansal/offlow\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android Application", "I worked on the backend for the application and Linux side application of the project", ""]], ["Hack Plan", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Hack plan</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Hack Plan</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nikhilnxvverma1/hack-plan\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nikhilnxvverma1/hack-plan\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the login page and page transitions.

Without any funds or direction, I saved the idea for a brighter day. When MHacks 8 rolled into town, the Dreem Meem Teem and I were excited to implement my idea.  Personally, I've always known I wanted to major in Biomedical Engineering in college. Finding out new research is really exciting to me, but teaching others about seemingly complex ideas is very rewarding; especially when it is done with such an aesthetically-pleasing interface. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This a simulation that allows the user to interact with a normal cell with the aim to disturb its gene expression. Our simulation addresses the question: What does it take for a cell become a cancer? In this simulation, for demo purposes, we decided to focus on the p53 gene, once thought to code for oncogenes. The p53 gene is the tumor suppressor gene located in the 17th chromosome of the human genome. If the gene experiences base pair mutations, then the cell runs the risk of becoming malignant as a result of suppressed gene expression.</p>\n<p>There are many ways that the trillions of cells populating your person can become malignant and dangerous. This simulation highlights a few of the multitudinous ways your cells can become cancer cells. Specifically in this program, single base pair mutations in the chromosomal DNA located in the nucleus can be controlled by the user, allowing them to see how a seemingly insignificant change in the genetic make-up of an organism can seriously affect how certain processes are carried out (or if they aren't carried out at all).</p>\n<p>The user is presented with a series of variables to affect the normal cell in its environment in order to convert it into a cancer cell. With a series of fun animations and interesting tinkering capabilities, people of all ages can see how genomics can play a role into the creation of cancer cells. Perhaps, using this simulation to further understand how cancer comes into being, we can raise more awareness for something a lot of people around the world must live with on a daily basis. By understanding the arbitrary, we will be able come up with answers.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We divided the work into 3 large categories: research, design, and frame-working. Two members worked on research, while one did frame-working and general simulation-building while the other focused primarily on designing the animations. Later, we uploaded the bits and pieces to the framework. I wrote a set of directions for the user to follow along to guide them through the app's functionality. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We did not have enough time to add each idea to the completed program, which would've been more fun for the user to play with. We had a hard time choosing only a few of the variables to incorporate into the project. However, we do wish we could've shown more creativity, which was impossible in such a short amount of time. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were very organized. We were able to divide up work equally and work for hours with sleep shifts as well. We were able to brainstorm and cooperate as group in order to complete such a strenuous task. We finished before the deadline, which goes to show that we were able to accomplish so much in 36 hours while still having tons of fun.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Amino acids play a crucial role in the formation of proteins that assist in carrying out metabolic functions of cells. After they are translated from DNA to RNA and then RNA is pushed through a ribosome which then prints out the amino acid chain the DNA originally coded for, the little amino acid strands all link up together to form tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins. Any little mistake, even single base pairs being replaced, can cause serious problems for any cell. </p>\n<p>When genes are expressed incorrectly, they have the potential of becoming cancer cells. The gene we selected for this demo is especially prone to single base pair mutations. Discovered only a decade ago, recent studies, experiments and clinical trials note that the p53 gene seems to play a large role in the development of many common cancers. \nAwareness and understanding is vital in order to begin to solve the problems we currently face in medicine. Cancer has been around longer than recorded human history. People are pre-disposed to certain malignant diseases, and it is imperative that people obtain the proper screenings necessary to potentially catch cancer at an early stage. Single base pair mutations happen all the time, but our DNA polymerases and helices  (molecular tools that replicate and spellcheck DNA) tends to take care of this issue most of the time, as well as B and T-cells, specialized white blood cells, which actively comb through our cells to find cancerous cells that are ready to rebel. </p>\n<p>However, this is not enough in some cases. Cancer can go undetected in your immune system and mobilize, metastasizing throughout your body until it is too powerful to fight. Yet, we are on the verge of using gene editing tools to fully eradicate powerful diseases such as cancer. Today, you used a simulated, digital version of a gene editing tool in order to prompt a normal cell to become malignant, much like what scientists have recently been doing in laboratories across the world.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HackMyHaploid</h2>\n<p>We're hoping to add more traceable genes that can be affected by single base pair mutations within the human genome. We really want to add more variables, such as antibodies and receptor proteins to show users that it can be theoretically possible to stop a cancer cell from dividing further or even revert back to it's original state. We really want to raise awareness, globally, by educating a lot of people on how mutations in their genomes actually work, and how it sometimes causes cancer. More curiosity equals more interested folks willing to stand behind the scientists and health care professionals wanting grants and donations to further our research and get closer to the miracle cure that could save millions of lives. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://dreemmeemteem.github.io/HackMyHaploid/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://dreemmeemteem.github.io/HackMyHaploid/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>dreemmeemteem.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed animations and other assets used in the project.

The ability to schedule tasks and organize priorities can quickly become challenging as the number of tasks, chores, and responsibilities you have to deal with increases. What if we could alleviate that burden for you?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The goal of Plan Me is to alleviate the burden of scheduling tasks by planning your entire day for you. Using sudo-machine learning, Plan Me creates a profile for each user so that it can learn the priorities, and the preferred schedule of the user. When a user then inputs all the tasks they have to complete throughout the week, it will calculate the most effective schedule based on the user's profile. If the tasks are more than the user can handle, Plan Me will automatically figure out which duties are not important, and will cut it from the schedule. Using an online database, a user can access their calendar from anywhere in the world. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Plan Me is a React based website hosted through Github Pages, with a pure JavaScript back end. We use Firebase to store all our user profile, event, and calendar data. Combining the real-time database with Firebase's Google authentication allows for us to easily edit and access user data from any location. To start off the calendar process, we conduct a customized personality test that allows us to base event priority on the user profile. We use our JavaScript scheduling module to process all the events into a calendar object, which is then pushed to our database. The module also checks how much free time is available, so it can spread it out between tasks accordingly.  All our JavaScript files are bundled together with Webpack. Material-UI api is used to create several of the React components. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One challenge that we ran into is in balancing the accuracy of the calendar scheduling. As the scheduling is based upon the user profile, it is vital that the profile is very accurate. However, accuracy comes at a cost. The more accurate the profile, the more data we need to compute it. We needed to find a balance where the profile is accurate most of the time, without forcing the user to spend too long answering personality questions. Our plan to resolve this issue is to use machine learning to generate a user profile for several categories of users (such as \"finishes tasks first\", \"does not like doing work\", etc.). This allows us to quickly narrow down the type of user, and then further customize with a higher degree of accuracy. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were most proud when we were able to successfully convert the event data into a properly scheduled calendar. The problem with creating the calendar was that if there was even any small mistake in the data processing, it would give the completely wrong output. Especially with all the edge cases, we were very happy when the algorithm was finally able to efficiently calculate the most efficient schedule.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>One thing we learned was how to effectively combine code together together to create the web application. We learned how to effectively combine Firebase with our React DOM, along with getting that all to run properly with our own scripts. With all of us coming from a different CS background, everyone was able to fill a different role that was required for our site to work effectively. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Plan Me</h2>\n<p>As previously stated, the next plan for Plan Me is to increase the accuracy of the user profile through machine learning. This would allow us to develop general templates for different types of people, which would allow for a questionnaire to easily narrow down to a template, then customize further to suit the user. We would collect user data through the initial questionnaire (several thousand is required for accuracy), and the user satisfaction about the calendar, and feed it in through machine learning to accurately predict results. </p>\n<p>Additionally, we plan on adding much more options into the website, that would allow users to specify exactly what they want in more detail. This would include options such as more specific categories, and an additional questions option for the questionnaire. The goal of this would be to increase the user satisfaction, and allow for users to use the site to its full potential. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material-ui</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webpack</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://plan-me.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://plan-me.org\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>plan-me.org</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DavidSGK/calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/DavidSGK/calendar\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["My main role was connecting all pieces together.

Due to the recent hype with Pokemon GO!, the idea of Monopoly GO! just naturally came to us. We thought the concept was not only outstandingly interesting but also challenging for a Hackathon, which motivated us to build this mobile web game in less than 36 hours. The reason we want it to be mobile-based is pretty evident in that the users are playing this game outside while exploring their neighborhoods. We built it on the web since it's too much work to make a hybrid mobile app. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows users to enter a game room where a preset map is chosen. When all players reach the starting point, the game automatically begins by selecting the first user to roll a die by accelerating his/her phone in the z-direction. This player then receives a number 'n' and will be prompted to walk to that specific location 'n' units away (which is shown on the map), while GPS tracks the player's location. When the player arrives, he/she will either arrive at an already owned house by another player, his/her own house or a for-sale house. Based on these cases, he/she will either have to pay the rent, do nothing or choose whether to buy the house respectively. After this player finishes, the second player will be prompted to roll the dice. If the player's 'bank balance' becomes less than 0 when he/she has to rent another person's house, then the player loses and will be shut out from the game room. If all houses are bought, then the player with the highest net-asset wins. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first divided our work into primarily 2 sections: back-end and front. One of our teammates was solely in charge of setting up the database with node.js and mongodb, whereas the other two focused on UI, which includes manipulating google maps API, simulating dice roll with accelerometer and three.js, and designing overall logic of the game. We used github as a way to collaborate.\nAfter we are done our separate parts, we then had to piece the UI parts together and integrate the server side to our design logic. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>First of all we wanted to try something new, so we used a framework called semantic ui when none of us had any experience with it. Moreover we all knew bootstrap but since our goal is to learn, we did not end up using it either.\nWe had a hard time building the rolling dice since it involved both accelerator and WebGL, and we have never acquainted ourselves with them either, making adjusting the parameters extremely difficult.\nWe also encountered difficulties while integrating back-end with front-end due to the conflicts in logic, which involves graphics. Because we are dealing with graphics, it's easy to make a mistake, which causes memory leaks or infinite loops. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of completing the basic structure of this project since the entire thing is a challenge for us from the beginning, as we almost thought it was impossible. Also we worked harmoniously throughout the Hackathon, which bonded us with each other more. Moreover not only were we unprecedentedly productive, but also we still managed to have fun during the events, with lots of swags. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>There's no doubt that we all learned something new, whether it's our first time dealing with WebGL or using semantics UI. These new areas of knowledge allowed us to learn even more in other fields. \nWe also learned that sleep is important.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Monopoly GO!</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of features that we want to integrate but we didn't have time, so here are a few:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Instead of making preset maps for users, we want the users to be able to draw their own maps which allows all users to play, instead of only those in the specific regions where we have defined the maps.</li>\n<li>The game design would be more complicated than this basic idea that we have.

We hope that with this webapp we created, we can improve people's quality of life by spending less time angry behind the wheel, and more time doing the errands they needed.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Overlays a heatmap near areas with parking lots to help residents of the city be able to locate a vacant parking lot within their area of interest.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the parking lot data given by Data Driven Detroit as a starting point, then we used Google's Geocoding API to convert the parking lot data given by Data Driven Detroit. We made the assumption that a popular point of interest will decrease the availability of parking spaces within the area, so we created an algorithm that uses Foursquare's API to find locations near the parking lots and determine the probability that a person will be able to find a parking space there.</p>\n<p>Our algorithm will account for the time of day, the type of location, the popularity of the business, and the foot traffic of the location to determine the probability of finding a parking space within the parking lot.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>API issues with rate limits and UI design choices were the main issues we have ran into. Firstly, a data-intensive operation such as this project does not fare well with APIs relating to searching locations. To alleviate this issue, and increase the speed of our project, we have cached the necessary information received from the APIs to provide accurate data with a near-real-time implementation.</p>\n<p>Secondly, creating an easy to use user interface is difficult task, especially when dealing with data-related projects when our audience is usually less computer-savvy. We have researched into what type of UI is best for abstracting away extraneous details, and we have decided on a right-sidebar implementation, animations, and a heatmap to allow people to easily understand our data. For our branding, we decided on a bold font and bright-yellow color to bring a more memorable and authoritative theme.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to represent near-real-time data with the large amounts of information needed to make the heatmap more accurate. Creating UI that is simple to understand requires a lot of visual queues, and we think we made a great MVP given the time constraints.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Some of our members did not have prior experience with the tech we worked with, like talking to APIs and clientside programming. If we were to pick one, learning to read and use an API is probably the most we have learned, given that we worked on a lot of data from other organizations.</p>\n<h2>What's next for ParkD</h2>\n<p>More coverage in the city, and eventually expand to more cities.\nTweaking algorithm to better predict the availability of parking spaces by including more mediums of identifying the car traffic of a location.\nMobile app to let users find a location on the fly.\nUser accounts for better tracking and provide bookmarks for commonly accessed locations.\nWarn users to be aware of a surge of people at a specified location.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/foursquare\">foursquare</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">leafletjs</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/angushtlam/ParkD-MHacks8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/angushtlam/ParkD-MHacks8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://parkd-mhacks8.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://parkd-mhacks8.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>parkd-mhacks8.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Jammin", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I've always enjoyed dances and parties as a way to socialize, but I don't have any smooth moves, so I always ended up just swaying awkwardly in a corner.

Only one member of our team was actually familiar with conducting or had a music background, but it was the willingness of the others to learn and take interest in the subject that made Vivace great. We wanted to help those who had no experience with musical ensembles or conducting to experience something new in a fun, unique, and exciting way. Conducting and leading an orchestra is certainly difficult, but when it's done right, it's an extremely rewarding feeling. We felt that this subject could be gamified to reach a large audience, and perhaps to even help those who are preparing or practicing for actual conducting experiences.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Vivace is an HTC Vive Virtual Reality experience, which means users can actually move around in the 3D space we created. The game begins in a large concert hall with several attendees clapping, and the player will begin a tutorial on how to conduct using a baton. In real life, that user is actually holding an HTC Vive controller, but in the Virtual World it will show them in front of an orchestra, holding a baton, ready to start creating music. The tutorial consists of several lessons on tempo, movement, and how to effectively conduct. We used colored panels to show where the player should hit with their baton on certain beats, and these panels light up on their respective beats. In this sense, we made conducting into a fun rhythm game.</p>\n<p>However, once the tutorial is over and the player was walked through the basics, we let them actually conduct real music. The panels will light up according to the beats-per-minute of actual songs, and the conductor must keep up and hit the correct panels on the correct beats in order for the music to make sense. If the user is conducting too slow, the orchestra will play very slowly and will sound distorted. If the user is conducting too fast, the music will be high-pitched and sped up. The goal is to find that \"Sweet spot\" where the player's beats-per-minute match that of the real song.</p>\n<p>We have several songs available in this demo: Ode to Joy, Amazing Grace, Zelda's Lullaby, Mute City, and Jingle Bells. Each one is different and will offer a new challenge.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Vivace using the Unity Game Engine and the HTC Vive, which means all our programming was done in C#. The 3D models (Including the concert hall and the baton) where made using Autodesk Maya.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Vivace was not our original idea for the hackathon, and we actually only pivoted to it halfway through the event. We decided we wanted to take on a topic more lighthearted and fun than our original goal, and wanted to bring the same joy to others while also showing them a cool niche talent.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>By the end of our project, the entire team could conduct, regardless of experience! Half the fun of this project was working through it, testing it, and getting better ourselves as a proof of concept for what we were creating. Of course, being able to actually succeed at conducting was pretty rewarding too. This was also our first ever music project, which we're quite proud of since we often tackle social good projects in VR, but have never quite delved into the fine arts.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned some interesting drawbacks to audio in Unity, and had to adapt our strategy several times in order to build a game that entirely revolves around accurate and on-time, though not necessarily predictable, audio queues. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Vivace</h2>\n<p>In addition to this being a fun game to spread and share with others, we truly believe this application can be used in actual ensembles to help conductors, drum majors, or directors prepare and practice their conducting. It can especially be useful to students who are just learning how to conduct!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">htc-vive</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/autodesk\">autodesk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maya\">maya</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vive</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/connor-a-smith/mhacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/connor-a-smith/mhacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/share/WkfblwjEcW/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/share/WkfblwjEcW/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>build.cloud.unity3d.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I attempted automated beat detection and scaling music without pitch shifting.

This could be using any average of acceleration, braking, and steering angle. This analysis of driver analytics will allow the vehicle to determine a specific driver who is driving the vehicle and their specific preferences within the vehicle. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Utilizing data gathered from GM vehicle sensors we created a platform to analyze driving data sent to an offboard server running on Wolfram Cloud. This driving data is analyzed using machine learning algorithms we developed to accurately determine who is driving the vehicle based on their driving patterns. The driver is then shown a driving score at the end of their drive based on their acceleration, braking, and quick turns during the drive. Having a vehicle that can determine the driver's identity based on previous drives allows the vehicle to make decisions on driver experience autonomously. If the vehicle can determine who is driving the car, the driver doesn't have to worry about climate control, seat position, mirror position, favorite music stations, or any other personal settings within the vehicle. Having a car that knows who is driving the car without user input allows a seamless driver experience from the start of the engine to the close of the garage door upon return.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this app using a combination of Html and Javacript running with the support of the GM NGI SDK to forward vehicle data to a cloud hosted by Wolfram Language script to run data analysis on the data received from the GM vehicle. This data is then processed using Wolfram machine learning functions to determine who is driving the vehicle by inputting the acceleration intensity, braking intensity, and steering intensity. These machine learning functions then classify who is driving the vehicle given a training data set. This cloud hosted function then returns within a certain confidence interval who is driving the vehicle and continues to train that machine learning classifier function for that particular driver.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Challenges ran we ran through involved utilizing the machine learning functions within Mathematica. The Classify function within Mathematica only utilizes a certain format of data, therefore we developed our own machine learning function to classify data within a certain confidence interval. This allowed us to identify who is driving the vehicle based on a certain driver score that we calculated using braking intensity, acceleration intensity, and steering angle. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The accomplishment we are most proud of is accomplishing a GM vehicle app which is capable of classifying who is driving a car based on just a few sample drives of particular drivers. We were able to create a custom machine learning algorithm to classify drivers based on who was driving the car at a given time. This algorithm is improved based on an increased number of drivers improving the classifier function, and the more drivers we have within a certain vehicle, the higher confidence interval we have to determine who is driving the vehicle.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about the requirements to develop a machine learning algorithm that can determine individuality given a collection classifying data sets that improve over time. </p>\n<h2>What's next for GM DrivePrint</h2>\n<p>We aim for GM DrivePrint to continue to be developed as an inclusion on every future GM vehicle as an extension of the standard software package to assist the modern driver.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gm-ngi-sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ethansinjin/Fingerprint/blob/master/README.md\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ethansinjin/Fingerprint/blob/master/README.md\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["AcceleRhythm", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Music was becoming too static, we wanted to find a way to revamp music to reflect your environment </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Uses the acceleration and velocity of the car using the ngi-sdk from GM to change the beat of the music</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used a webserver to handle the communication and did the mixing on the phone app and used the general motors emulator to show the visualization</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Mixing the music was challenging until we switched to Unity</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting the Unity App, Emulator and webserver integrated properly</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We can take a very simple concept and add a twist to make it exponentially more hype</p>\n<h2>What's next for AcceleRhythm</h2>\n<p>Add more visualizations and make the app more extensible</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ngi-sdk</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/elc1798/mhacks8-ngi-app\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/elc1798/mhacks8-ngi-app\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/nkataoka/MHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/nkataoka/MHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gitlab.eecs.umich.edu</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/elc1798/mhacks8-relay-server\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/elc1798/mhacks8-relay-server\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I split a song into tracks using Audacity and programmed them in Unity to weave together based on the engine speed and accelerator.

With cameras and sensors embedded into the paddle, data mapping the speed, orientation, and position of a user\u2019s wrists are processed in a constant stream. Motors on the edges of the paddle vibrate in reaction to incorrect form, modifying angle of swing and gently correcting the user\u2019s orientation. Within the IMU, a gyroscope and accelerometer track stability and fluidity of movement, lightly vibrating the motors when jerkiness passes a certain threshold.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We designed and 3D printed a custom paddle design with ridges for embedded sensors and a hollow handle for any wires. With the Teensy Arduino, we embedded six vibrational motors on the sides and top of the paddle and mounted a PS3-eye camera to the back. We also used an IMD for its gyroscope and accelerometer.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">svo</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">imu</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/makerbot\">makerbot</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ps3-eye</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Gifioms", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gifioms \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/838/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Wanted to make a fun hack for people to try and maybe challenge their friends too</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Makes you guess for the missing keyword to complete the idiom while given a gif as a clue</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Used react and the giphy API</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/asaddar/Gifioms\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/asaddar/Gifioms\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["heart", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JwZ719KLjwc?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It is very easy to eat unhealthy and to be blissfully unaware while doing so. Popular restaurant chains side towards hiding important nutritional information. Products package themselves as healthy but in reality, they make a profit off every nutrient they exclude. </p>\n<p>We wanted to create an app that makes it easy to eat healthily. One that using the pictures of foods you have eaten throughout the day is able to provide actionable feedback for staying healthy and feel good.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The prototype of heart tackles deciphering images for the food items. With the app, your able to take a picture of a food item then heart returns the recipe, ingredients, and nutritional count of the food. Then the prototype simply uses that data to count calories for you.</p>\n<h2>Technical challenges</h2>\n<p>The difficulty with this app is that computer vision alone does not have enough information within the photo to decipher the exact recipe and ingredients of the dish. We are able to tag the visible ingredients but as there are a large number of variations of different dishes its near impossible to determine which variation is in the picture.</p>\n<p>Our solution to reduce the scope of the computer vision challenge was to add geolocation into the mix. We used geolocation to limit the possible dishes that you may have eaten to only dishes cooked by restaurants in the area. This allows us to identify with high accuracy any dishes eaten on going out. </p>\n<p>The solution works particularly well for restaurants but not for home cooked food. Home cooked foods are generally simpler; therefore, we maintain a separate database of simple recipes to match against home cooked food that is also partitioned by location to reduce the scope of the computer vision problem. </p>\n<p>The app relies heavily on an indexed database; therefore, if a dish is not in the database. We allow the user to add it to our database easily. We load a screen with as many inputs prefilled based on what we think is the closest matching dish.</p>\n<h2>What's next for heart</h2>\n<p>The app worked surprisingly well. Our next steps are to scrape data for restaurants in Seattle. Then we will move to production with an MVP on the app store.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">es6</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">es7</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">babel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">s3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clarifai\">clarifai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webpack</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gps\">gps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">data-mining</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">web-scraping</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Let Me Know", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Let Me Know \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/559/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing Page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Laziness, brevity, and </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Finds relevant topical articles regarding important and trending topics in the news.

Many areas of the city are largely empty, and it's easy to feel dangerously alone and unprotected while walking through them -- especially at night.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Safety in Numbers uses cameras distributed at intersections around the city. These cameras can recognize human forms, and track how many people are in an area as well as the intervals between their passing. That data is then fed into a live heat map accessible at our website displaying crowd density across the city of Detroit in real time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For the cameras, we attached a Logitech webcam to an Intel Edison computer, and then fed the data into a node.js server, which in turn passed it to a Firebase database. From there, we took the data from each camera and used its location to plot points on a map powered by Google Maps, which used the data to form a heat map.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Of the four of us, three had no prior experience with node.js and server-hosting. To complete our project, we had to learn both from scratch, which took a huge percentage of our time. We also ran into numerous hardware difficulties, ranging from pulling data from the Edison to broken equipment.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This was one of our biggest projects, and for most of us it was our first foray into using technology for social impact on this kind of scale. Really, we're just happy to have made something to try and help the citizens of detroit.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Safety in Numbers</h2>\n<p>At the moment, Safety in Numbers is primarily just a reference for people to look at. In the future, we'd like to pursue integration with car GPS modules in order to plan rides through the city and sticking to streets where it's ok to stop at stop signs. We would also like to pursue Facebook messenger bots that could let users know if they are entering a low crowd-density area.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri\">esri</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mqtt</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">logitech-webcam</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.dgcadetroit.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.dgcadetroit.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dgcadetroit.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end of the webpage and also integrating Esri's Api as well.\nWorked with HTML/CSS, Bootstrap and javascript.", "", "", ""]], ["Snorkel", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Snorkel \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/585/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Homepage</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Snorkel \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/589/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Constructing the network</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Snorkel \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/684/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Selecting Training Data</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The concept of \"deep learning\" always has (and still is) mystical to even the very best in the field, but this hasn't stopped it from getting the public's attention in a very major way. We're constantly bombarded with headlines that make it clear what kind of impact deep learning is having on entertainment, transportation, and lifestyle. However, anyone who wants to go further than just being \"wowed\" by deep learning quickly encounters a roadblock---even the simplest of deep learning applications usually require either copious amounts of code, or extremely obscure difficult code: either way, one quickly gets turned off of deep learning altogether.</p>\n<p>This is what prompted Snorkel---while a snorkelling mask allows us regular humans to dive into the deep sea, Snorkel is meant to do the same for deep learning. Snorkel is an entirely visual interface to a powerful convolutional neural network engine, allowing users to deploy deep neural networks quickly, and with a much better more abstract understanding of what's going on, rather than a more syntax-focused micro-view. Let's look at an example:</p>\n<h2>What it does [Use Case]</h2>\n<p>Let's say we're very interested in reading about deep learning, and so we find a couple of introductory articles, and start reading. They all discuss the MNIST dataset, a very common first problem in deep learning. All of the articles are essentially the same with respect to how the neural network works, but it's very hard to decipher that, as they all use different frameworks, different models, etc. However, we've noticed that pretty much every deep learning publication has a graph that looks something like this: </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-canonical-url=\"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz49.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--Wb_8opR---/http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/images/tikz49.png\"/></p>\n<p>Thanks to Snorkel, all you need is to understand that diagram, and then you can build that directly as your neural network: </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-canonical-url=\"http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/589/datas/gallery.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--s0-XaNQl--/http://challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/589/datas/gallery.jpg\"/></p>\n<p>You can then train the neural network on the dataset of your choice, and try it out yourself!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The backend of Snorkel was built from scratch using Torch7 (a powerful deep learning framework) and LuaJIT (the language it was implemented in).</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>A lot of the intricacies of deep learning! There's a reason most languages are so verbose, and generalizing that into an abstract ConvNet model was actually pretty difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Most deep learning projects that are done at hackathons can usually only be taking some pretrained network and feeding in some new data, so it's really exciting that I got to write most of the project from the ground up!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about Torch7 (I had some familiarity, but once again, most of it was plugging stuff into existing models), and about deep learning models in general!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Snorkel</h2>\n<p>I was actually working on free text support instead of just images (and I might have it done by judging time!), and I think that will be a huge step for Snorkel's applicability!

Therefore I love NASA. NASA has over 9000 APIs. Number of NASA APIs I've used before: 0. Time to get started.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It pulls data from two NASA Open APIs: Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) and Mars Trek: WMTS Layer Services. It then displays the data out to the user from my website. The APOD API shows amazing photos of the cosmos (or right back here on Earth!). The Mars Trek: WMTS Layer Services let me display maps composed of many, many different tiles. These maps range from large craters where NASA's own Mars rovers have landed, to literally the entire landscape of Mars. The zoom functions themselves are incredible (all thanks to esri).</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I originally started building it with only HTML and CSS, but quickly realized that the only way I could make my webpage functional was with Javascript. I've never used JS before the weekend (although I'm sure you can tell by the code). Besides learning JS (and eventually JQuery), the biggest/longest part of production was with esri's ArcGIS services. That was how I was able to display Mars with such detail and functionality.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I had to learn Javascript. And JQuery. And esri's ArcGIS services. All by myself. In 36 hours. That was enough challenge for me.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The whole thing. That it's done. But also the fact that I can zoom straight into Mars and scan it's landscape straight from my own personal website.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>If you read any of this story, you get the gist.</p>\n<h2>What's next for NASA API Folio (NAF)</h2>\n<p>There is over 9000 more things I could do with NAF.

The application displays the user's current location and time, and corresponding density map. Since incidents aren't distributed evenly throughout the day, we created a feature that filters the data based on the seleced hour.

We took a large chunk of our time discussing what would be a project that was challanging, but doable and it took quite a bit of time to settle on one. From this hackathon we gained valuable experience in Android app development and working as team and most importantly I think we can use these to our advantage in future hackathons. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Health Noodle</h2>\n<p>Our next goal is to attend future hackathons as a team and continue to try and develop amazing things that are fun to use and have a useful purpose.

Our prototype device receives transmitted credit card data through flashes of light that represent binary, and stores the data string via photoresistor. From there, it interprets high and low voltages as 1's and 0's and seamlessly saves all of your credit cards in a single device. You can now ditch your wallet, and actually broadcast the encrypted data via an electromagnetic field that we generate through several motor drivers, so you can make purchases at any Point-of-Sales terminal. On top of that, we create an air-tight means of data transmission! The inspiration behind this invention was technology such as Swipe or Square. They encrypt magstripe data into an audio file, but there have been known ways to break this. We thought outside-the-box, and created a way to transmit this sensitive data via LIGHT instead, which is virtually unhackable because there are no scenarios where there can be interceptable packets.   </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Claire Li wrote the Android application that communicates the binary light signals, and created the hardware portion of the hack that recieves the magstripe data into the device. We send the photoresistor signals into an analog input pin in an Arduino Uno, then route it to a Raspberry Pi that interprets the information. Ben Roytenberg created the hardware portion of the hack that broadcasts the data to POS-terminals for real purchases, and interpreted the stored magstripe data. He generates the electromagnetic field with this information via stepper motor driver. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This was a very complex hack, and we ran into obstacles across every form of technology we worked with. From the first night, we realized we had to SSH headless into a Raspberry Pi and got stalled with running even the most basic scripts or checking that the photoresistor circuit was even working (it definitely wasn't, and had to be redone three or four times with help). Claire ran into issues with multi-threading and controlling the flash on an Android device to communicate the light data, and getting the photoresistor circuit to work. She had to also find a way to package the information and pass it to Ben's portion of the hardware. Ben ran into issues such as researching Track 1, and Track 2 data for credit card magstripes, and coming up with the technology to generate the electromagnetic field, and doing a lot of prototyping and testing to ensure the data is being emitted correctly.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Throwing together the entire hack as a two-man team, and working across software and hardware, and creating a device that challenged us not only as software engineers, but also as taught us a lot about embedded systems and financial security technology.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Where there is a will, there is a way!</p>\n<h2>What's next for LightSwipe</h2>\n<p>Adding multi-colored LED's that show live progress of transmission, and setting up a web UI that also shows transactions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">photoresistors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Medication Alert", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Medication Alert \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/407/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Confirmation Button</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Medication Alert \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/408/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Data Entry</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Medication Alert \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/591/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Background Notification</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Medication Alert</h2>\n<p>Improperly taking medication or forgetting to can severely limit the effectiveness of the medication and be seriously dangerous. After learning that many patients who take prescription medication don't take their meds as prescribed, we decided that we could make some sort of reminder app that would remind users to actually take them on time, and make it more difficult to forget. A phone app seemed like the best option for this idea, we decided on Android because our group had personal Android phones and could test easily. We then realized that we could easily access sms and send a text notification to the user's doctor or medical services, so they can remind the patient themselves or help them if the missed medication was critical to the user's health.  On system boot, a background service starts that periodically checks the time, sending a notification if a set notification time is reached. Either the user or their doctor can enter in data about a medication and when to take it (see Data Entry image), that data is saved in a local xml file on the android device, can be easily retrieved, and persists across reboots. If the app were developed further, we could add more customization options, and could implement a way to notify health services.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/AnthonyHewins/MHacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/AnthonyHewins/MHacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["There were only the two of us, so we each did a lot.

What I noticed was that there wasn't a very attractive way for people to search for shelter cats, and given the burden on shelters in the US, they need all the marketing they can get. Also, there was no service that ran a reverse image search to find shelter cats ...I found this really surprising. And so, I set out to create such a service.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The app lets you search for shelter cats based on an image and a zipcode.

I think moving away from the Petfinder's API would be a good step as they permit only a certain number of requests per month, and I think with a true scraper could help get more cats on the platform. I want to continue improving on this because I do believe that there is more than enough room for technology in the pet world, and maybe as a result more cats will find good homes.</p>\n<p>I should probably mention that it's not hard to make this for dogs as well, for you dog lovers out there.</p>\n<p>Overall, great experience, it being my first MHacks and all :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ejs\">ejs</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">es6</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materialize</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://feline-felicity.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://feline-felicity.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>feline-felicity.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Andrewjeska/FelineFelicity/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Andrewjeska/FelineFelicity/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["DETPM", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DETPM \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/571/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The Detroit People Mover</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DETPM \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/594/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DETPM \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/595/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DETPM \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/596/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DETPM \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/609/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>The Detroit People Mover app</h2>\n<p>Now Detroit residents can know when The People Mover is nearby, providing access to safe, efficient, reliable transit for all Detroit residents so they can get to their school, work, and other activities securely and on time.</p>\n<h2>Safety first</h2>\n<p>Many Detroit residents depend on public transit, but they often have limited options for traveling to work, school, and other activities, or for getting there safely.</p>\n<h2>Nearby activities</h2>\n<p>Find nearby attractions, restaurants, and activities.

The goal of our project is to leverage the versatility of the Infotainment System equipped in General Motors to provide a more pleasant journey to the driver by relieving the anxiety of traffic jams and the dullness of cruising along a highway. Since many college students have to build up their vocabularies before they can further their studies, building their vocabularies in the journey will greatly reduce the time demand in the rest of their life, thereby reducing their anxieties in traffic jams and dullness along an empty highway.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Application, Cardict, provides two modes in helping building vocabularies. One is based on a classical flashcard method that asks the driver to decide whether a word is already mastered. The other is based on a synonym identification routine. By asking the driver to find the word that has a different meaning from the other two words, the driver is able to link synonyms quickly.  The interactions are transferred into Cardict via button inputs on the steering wheel or through the central sack. The words are prebuilt into Cardict using JSON. By comparing the standard response and the driver's response, a feedback is given to the driver, making the process highly engaging. The Application is based on HTML and Javascript, so it has a strong portability across most vehicles. The interactions, together with the mind-engaging activities in the vocabulary-building process, makes the journey on the GM vehicle more pleasant.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We employed the Software Development Kits provided by General Motors. The word lists are taken from common sources of open word lists. The user interface is based on the API provided by General Motors, where predefined functions return arrays of parameters that reflect the user's inputs. By testing the blocks of our program on the emulator and then validating the design on the bench, we have proven that our project works on General Motors' Infotainment System. Since we had no prior experience in HTML and Javascript, we spent quite a few hours on setting up the development environment and another quite a few hours on the syntaxes and flow controls of HTML and Javascript. Eventually, we made the project into a coherent part of the GM Infotainment System.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>To tell the truth, the industry-level SDK is not very user-friendly. The installation of the SDK is difficult because it is the first time for it to be exposed to the public. Also, many libraries are not available to us. The hardest part should be the Javascript language learning because none of the group members touched this language before. We need to learn it from scratch. Besides, the test benches are not stable and we always need to reconnect to them or even change the bench. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we become proficient in Javascript and the SDK provided by GM and we successfully develop an app which works well. Although we are lack of sleeping and the hardwares are bad, we keep going and solving problems. During the whole process, we four group members cooperate greatly and efficiently meet the aims we set. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>In the story, the gain in our experience is to develop with Javascript.

While still far off in the future, technology that is able to guess what you want to do by reading your mind is bound to become an integral part of our lives. While the project is not directly translatable to something as robust as I had imagined at first, I treated this as a learning experience to learn more about real-time signal processing.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The game itself is a re-creation of the popular space-invaders game released in 1978. Instead of controlling the player with keys however, the ship movement and shots is controlled through the muse headband in two parts. The built-in accelerometer will control the movement of the ship, while the players blinks trigger the shots.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The app is run on Java using the Swing framework for rendering the player. Communication between the application and the Muse headband is done through a command line tool called muse-io. First the muse is paired through bluetooth with the laptop, then the muse-io program connects to the device and streams data through itself. In order to access this data, a protocol named Open Sound Control (OSC) is used. Specific signals from the device are accessed on dedicated paths on localhost created by the muse-io program.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>At first I just wanted to experiment with the device and see what I could come up with. Since I was working alone, I decided to go with a relatively simple game implementation such as Space Invaders.</p>\n<p>My main challenge involved processing the raw EEG input from the headband in order to detect blinks from the user. There are 4 data points produced which measure voltages across the forehead, and these values are updated 200 times a second. Having never encountered any signal processing problems, I was at a loss on how to approach the problem. A bit of research led me to consider using Fourier transforms to detect peaks in the signals, however it was getting late so I ended up using the built-in /elements/blink path which returns the integer 1 when a person blinks. Given more time, I think I could have made a more reliable solution for my use case. The implementation I tried involved using a running average of the signal values but was not very reliable and prone to changes depending on how one wore the headset..</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was able to connect up to the muse relatively quickly and start seeing the data coming from the streams. It was a bit daunting at first given how much data there is but the end product doesn't feel impossible to control while still being difficult enough to be entertaining.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned about the OSC protocol which is used a lot in digital signal processing. Additionally I was able to get my feet wet in something I have zero experience with and the end product was satisfying given how primitive it is.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Mind Invaders</h2>\n<p>I would like to learn more about signal processing and try to rely less on the accelerometer for controls. While I think it is a lot more simple and intuitive, there are already many substitutes which can be used for similar things. The strength of the muse lies in the ability to read electric signals from the brain, thus controlling technology in was nothing else can. I wouldn't mind also improving the game aspect since it is very static currently. Adding power ups, or varying player power based on concentration could add a twist to the game which would make it worthwhile playing with the muse.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">swing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">osc</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I only did a bit"]], ["Hackaface", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMiORScXc-A?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hackaface \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/452/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We first know from the API expo that Microsoft offers a cool API which can do facial recognition, and this inspires us to make an app related to facial recognition.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user can first put a picture of a person into the app and partially cut the picture, and then challenges friends to guess what the person's emotion is.

The script passes movement information to an Arduino module that sends signals two the dismantled remote controls of the cars and tilt sensors. A webcam sits on top of the inverted wooden U-Frame that we built and captures the entire fight. Along with being helpful for streaming the fight to anyone in the world, the webcam also runs the computer vision algorithm, which can classify each bot to its respective team and determine when it exits the ring. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>OpenCV proved to be particularly challenging given inconsistent lighting and the moving objects.

Allowing eachother to abstract different aspects of the project allowed us to hit the ground running quickly and rapidly develop a prototype. We also developed a working understanding of serial communication.

Furthermore, vocabulary is limited to the words that they have said. We tried breaking words down into phonemes for a larger library of speech but that didn't work too well unfortunately.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Now we can finally hear Trump say non-discriminatory things (or hear Clinton say very discriminatory things)!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Markov Chains are incredibly effective at predicting speech and lots and lots of super powerful hardware along with some clever processing is required for any reasonable level of speech comprehension. </p>\n<h2>What's next for HilarityTrumpton</h2>\n<p>Making America Great Again</p>\n<h2>Video Demo 2</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBu3AzheUlU\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img alt=\"Trump Speech Generator\" data-canonical-url=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/bBu3AzheUlU/0.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--Y3w0kf3r--/http://img.youtube.com/vi/bBu3AzheUlU/0.jpg\"/></a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">markov-chains</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk\">nltk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cmusphinx</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ffmpeg\">ffmpeg</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hilaritytrumpton.ga\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hilaritytrumpton.ga\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hilaritytrumpton.ga</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://trumpcloud.tk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://trumpcloud.tk\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>trumpcloud.tk</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kpsuperplane/MHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kpsuperplane/MHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I sat near enough to these people to be counted on their team.", "I did everything", "I also did everything", "i think u got the wrong guy i didn't even go to mhacks"]], ["Road Trip", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We all thought that it would be wonderful to work with Amazon Alexa, as it can interact with users purely by voice.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our program prompts users about their budget and interests, then Alexa gives suggestions as to where they can go on a road trip using additional knowledge from google's api's and some rankings from your interests.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our application in Node.js and JavaScript and utilized the Google Place and Map APIs. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>A major challenge we ran into was getting the Amazon Alexa API in Node.js to work.

For one of our teammates its was his first Hackathon and still a relatively new experience for the rest of us. We learnt about configuring and searching for new APIs using RapidAPI's technologies. Two of our teammates started learning JavaScript to create a node.js backend as our django server won't configure well, while the rest of us started working with angular as we pivoted from an Android application to a web app. Although(luckily) we ended up with what we all originally planned, we became familiar with a lot of new technologies to work on in the future. </p>\n<h2>What's next for <em>vgrep</em>?</h2>\n<p>Increase accessibility for people with disabilities; we feel that our app can be of even more use if people with hearing or learning disabilities can learn with the aid of our platform when they could have otherwise not before.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I wrote the backend server with django.

If we post it on Youtube, it is lost among the millions of videos, and no one is going to stumble upon a film named 'Bland Brandish'. To solve this problem, I thought of a website which is a mixture of YouTube and Netflix. </p>\n<h2>How it Works</h2>\n<p>Filmmakers upload their shorts by linking their already uploaded youtube videos and add tags (genre) to it. \nWhen it comes to a user who wants to surf through the website, he/she has an option to search by genre, most viewed or recommended. Recommended uses a recommendation engine that works by monitoring the user's previous views and also an initial set up, a similar setup to Apple Music.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>On the back end, Indie Joe is powered by the Python web framework Flask and the simple database SQLite. I (Drew) started by making the database schema, and simple interfaces for the videos. For example, we made a function and page for searching and pages for viewing the video. \nWe then integrated the front end into the application. We used bootstrap to create a simple user interface with a navbar and sidebar, and this was a shared resource through every view of the website. We then began the process of creating the complete user interfaces, using our wireframes as a guide.\nFinally, we created the algorithm for predicting recommended videos. For the sake of simplicity, we decided to only integrate 5 genres into the database of movies. Using the genres, and tallying them according to the videos the user watched, we created a basic recommendation engine.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Figuring out what parameters to use for the Recommendation algorithm was definitely a big challenge, because it is a very subjective case. In the end we decided on having multipliers based on the user\u2019s genre preferences.\nThe time constraints of the hackathon put a pressure on us to have a functioning project, which made for especially sloppy code which, if we continue development, might pose a challenge in expanding the app with more functionality.\nBecause VB had little experience with Python, we had to convert his algorithm from Java code to Python. This eventually worked, but we ran into issues when translating different data types and syntax between the two languages. For example, VB\u2019s algorithm had a sorting function built in which was causing problems in our python implementation, so we switched to python\u2019s built in sort function, which made for cleaner code overall.\nFinally, it has been a challenge hosting the project on Microsoft Azure, because of the complexities of python and its dependency management system. We hope to have the code running on a Azure instance so we can keep developing on it.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We\u2019re most proud of having a functional project to submit. We believe this product could be improved in the future as a viable business. If we decide to pursue this further, we have a solid foundation to build on top of.\nWe\u2019re also proud that we figured out a recommendation algorithm that makes sense and predicts based on popularity of videos and the user\u2019s preferences for certain genres.\nAlso, the Name and Logo.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Drew: I learned a ton about the Python Flask framework.This is my first project using Flask, and I love how it is minimal and allows you to achieve so much with such simple code. I also strengthened my SQL knowledge, learning a new database system, SQLite, and learned more about the basic commands such as select, update, tables, etc.</p>\n<p>Vritant(VB): Researching and understanding the different kinds of recommendation algorithms was definitely an interesting experience. Learning how to weigh and rank different parameters was tricky, but a lot of fun. I also learnt some Python, HTML and CSS and some JavaScript while I tried to help Drew with the website. </p>\n<h2>Plans after the Hackathon</h2>\n<p>We will improve Indie Joe by refining the recommendation algorithms, not relying on YouTube and working on improving the user experience. We also hope to add a user accounts feature so that we can have access to more user\u2019s data to improve recommendations, and hopefully end up making a person-person recommendation system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/drewatk/indie-joe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/drewatk/indie-joe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on generating the idea, wire-framing, designing the UI, Recommendation Algorithm and Some parts of the front end side of the website.", "I worked on our Python (Flask) back end and integrating the web app with the SQLite database.

Once an image is uploaded, an output image is generated (and further rewritten), and from there the browser is continuously made to reload it.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I initially wanted to run 2 separate servers, one for hosting the web-app and doing the major work, and a small python service that would wait for images to warp. I wanted to do this to get more experience with IPC (specifically ZeroMQ), but I underestimated the amount of time it took me to get comfortable with vue - data binding is still a bit tricky with it for me.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm happy with my SectionedCanvas module. It's simple and a little bit messy, but it gets the job done. I've been trying to practice my design and scoping of a module, and I think it strikes a good balance between flexibility and effective-ness. I'm not sure if I'm ever going to use it again, but it taught me a few valuable lessons: I got it to resize not to the size of the entire browser window, like most examples on the web, but rather to its parent's size, and I also got it to resize effectively regardless of when it came to life with respect to Vue's DOM tampering.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>I learned Vue. That was fun. Can't say I like it more than React or Angular (well, maybe Angular) but it gets a job done and it's relatively clean.</li>\n<li>I learned how to use Python for image manipulation (normally use MATLAB)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next for The Pictorial Angularizer mk. 3000</h2>\n<p>the shelf? </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vue</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">matplotlib</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">math</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://github.com/pictorial-angularizer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://github.com/pictorial-angularizer\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["this me"]], ["Python game(turtle)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Haven't coded for quite a while so figured Id brush up my skills in python</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>its an unbeatable tic tac toe game...

Whether it was an airport, a mall, or a grocery store, hospital. Do you face a problem traveling around a city with ease (maybe if you've just moved to that city or maybe you just are stuck in traffic?). \nIt is a general problem that one feels unfamiliar with the procedures to be followed there. Furthermore, it is hard to find particular things such as Information Desk or Restrooms. Worse case, the person may have disabilities like blindness or muteness. \nGPS navigation may help you in getting from one place to another, but it can't be specific to guide you through every single building in the entire city and sometimes can't really help people who have disabilities. \nWho can possibly be our hero?</p>\n<h2>What is Wall-E</h2>\n<p>Wall-E is an IoT robot that helps people who have disabilities or who are new to places in guiding them outdoors and indoors using project tango mapping. Wall-E is designed to bring out the best of the current technologies: once a person initializes the path, the robot can automatically find its path when someone requests. That is, when Wall-E asks, \"Where would you like to go?\" a person could say \"bathroom\", or \"the ford desk\" or even \"remote controller and rather than going there yourself it can help you in guiding you through all the straights and turns with you either following it by walking or sitting in it.</p>\n<h2>Architecture behind Wall-E ?</h2>\n<p>Our team integrated a handful of top-notch technologies, including Intel Edison (2015, quad-core, RAM 800 MHz, max 8GB memory), Google Project Tango (2014, computer vision tablet that understands positions relative to the world around it), web-services via Node.js, and motor sensors. First, the facility managers (i.e. airport person, home owner, etc. ) must know where most things are at. Then he needs to start collecting location data by walking from the \"base point\" to each destination points. The pre-loaded locations are stored via \"data acquisition mode\" on the Tango tablet. Wall-E is smart, so he will remember every path you went to grab \"that thing\" you needed. Note: the wheels and Edison Board were far smaller than Tango tablet, so we added a sturdy tablet holder with compostable cardboard box pieces. 3D Printing (Makerbot Replicator) and industrial design methods were involved.</p>\n<p>For users, who is likely new to the place or someone with discomfort, they will easily find Wall-E at the most visible, public area. Wall-E holds the android tablet, Tango, and it will periodically ask \"Where would you like to go?\" The user will then tell the desired destination, and the bot will guide him to most anywhere. The speech-to-text is enabled via built-in Speech Recognition API, which will then get the location amongst the list of all the previously addressed places. When the mini-adventure is activated, Tango shoots out the signal to the web server, which then alerts to guide the guest to the place! And Intel Edison starts the bot into action. With our precise distance and angle controls, Wall-E will work out its wheels and power to get him there! For the wheels, the two 1kW DC brushless motors are used, which are similar to the ones used in electric chairs. For the power bank, Wall-E runs on a 2 kW battery as soon as the bot is placed in its charging spot. While in motion, Wall-E will not blink even a second to ensure there is no unexpected object interrupting us. If there is, Wall-E will pause you for a moment. Voila, we are never lost!</p>\n<h2>Any challenges?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Connecting to the internet was unavailable for Raspberry Pi, so we switched to Intel Edison board -- even better performance!</li>\n<li>Calibrating two different motor wheel performances -- one was slower, so we had to balance the Left &amp; Right motor speed.</li>\n<li>Connecting to the Bluetooth via Intel Edison board took much longer than we expected (5+ hrs), so we changed the environment to web services.</li>\n<li>Robot usability -- we envisioned Wall-E to be like \"R2D2\" from Star Wars or \"Wall-E\" from Wall-E movie; however, the limited time and knowledge did not allow us to fully expand our ideals. We still kept the touch screen and mobility features that we planned to do!</li>\n<li>Mobile app platform -- originally planned to do an iOS app that gets voice commands and Bluetooth signal to the embedded processor, but it was much simpler to directly create an Android app onto Tango. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Proud moments?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Finishing the hack! </li>\n<li>Connecting everything into IoT: Intel Edison board (motors, processors) - Web server - Android app - Tango initial mapping 3-axial accelerometer or real-time obstacle detecting integration.</li>\n<li>Solving how to control motor sensors via distance/seconds unit and trigonometry calculations</li>\n<li>Allowing Wall-E to be utilized for so many uses: city tour guide replacement, shopping guests in big stores, passengers in train stations or airports, new students at a school, assistance dog alternative for the blinds, a big mansion guidance without a butler, and etc. </li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Lessons we've learned.</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Never stop finding our way -- with hearts of ambition and passion, we can find a way</li>\n<li>Hardware integration takes careful attentions and details</li>\n<li>Flexibility in many computer languages is always helpful</li>\n<li>Minimum Viable Product methodology is wise and efficient</li>\n<li>Caution in 3D Printing -- to always think in three dimensions</li>\n<li>Setting Bluetooth connection takes extra steps</li>\n<li>How to implement navigation throughout the city (indoors as well as outdoors) using project tango mapping.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a comfortable seat so that one can conveniently sit and watch, as Wall-E finds the path</li>\n<li>Bluetooth between Tango and Intel Edison board -- faster connectivity</li>\n<li>Add on the design aspects for the Android app and the robot</li>\n<li>Beeping alerts when in guidance (ex. beep for easier follow rather than listening to the motor sounds, beep when obstacles, ask questions for friendliness of the robot)</li>\n<li>Better motor controls (i.e., non-90-degree rotations of all times, various speed controls, flexibility in rough floors)</li>\n<li>Larger data handling (with mapping an entire city with every single building) for better flow of people as well as lesser traffic on road.</li>\n<li>Replacement of the amount of the current on road cars and regulation of flow of not only traffic but even people.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Links:</h2>\n<p>1 min, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2R5CCwQQUP0?list=PLw3XL9sPIofnI1y1Xrt28RenZR0pmfIGO\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/2R5CCwQQUP0?list=PLw3XL9sPIofnI1y1Xrt28RenZR0pmfIGO</a>\n30 seconds, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/prjxgRk3BnE?list=PLw3XL9sPIofnI1y1Xrt28RenZR0pmfIGO\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/prjxgRk3BnE?list=PLw3XL9sPIofnI1y1Xrt28RenZR0pmfIGO</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/project-tango\">project-tango</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mdnahian/Wall-E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mdnahian/Wall-E\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Rebuild", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I am really into cities and city planning, so when I heard the hackathon was in Detroit, I knew I had to do something about the city.

Not only is it smart enough to brew coffee at the perfect temperature and time, it knows how to adjust the amount of water to change acidity: or the caffeine. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>On the frontend, Usnavi is just a simple coffee maker, made to look different through automation. Its designed after the simple scheme of the drip coffee maker, however it is smart enough to change many factors about coffee that most coffee makers cannot. With Usnavi, we have the ultimate control over things like temperature and acidity-leading to the ultimate coffee experience.</p>\n<p>One the backend, Usnavi learns more about the user the more they use it. It consumes numerous api's to measure important data about the user: such as how many Facebook notifications they have, or if they're current stocks suffered a loss. By utilizing this data, Usnavi can brew a cup of coffee with the perfect amount of caffeine in it to survive a days work. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>Usnavi is built using common parts from around the house: an electric kettle, rulers, and plywood. However, the technology that fuels it is high end. The inner technology uses numerous high-level api's from around the tech world to build a profile all about caffeine. Mechanically, Usnavi uses an Arduino to control the servos controlling the different brew cups. Although it may not look pretty, Usnavi functions very well.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Working to make such a specialized product can be frustrating. There are many things that can go wrong, especially when working on a hardware hack. One such example is coming up with mechanical a valve system. This was by far our hardest challenge, and led us to think very hard about coming up with solutions. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>This project was a new frontier for everyone on the team. Such a hack has never really been done before, so we all had to pitch in to make it work. After facing many different challenges that couldn't really have been predicted, we strived to achieve excellence and finish our project. In the end, we all learned more than we thought we would.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Usnavi</h2>\n<p>Usnavi has a lot in its future. It currently utilizes 9 api's, but there could be hundreds more incorporated for a final project. Another improvement for Usnavi is its mechanical movements. Our iteration of this product is somewhat outdated by many new electronic valve systems, but unfortunately we were unable to acquire any of these.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2\">google</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">finance</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">text-to-speech</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/noahrinehart/mhacks8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/noahrinehart/mhacks8\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I was in charge of the backend and api consumption.

This fact not only shocked us, but inspired us to do something about it. We wanted to create something simple that would be applicable to the general population. Our solution was staysafewith.me, an openly accessible web application that helps individuals avoid dangerous parts of Detroit. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By taking years of crime data made available at <a href=\"https://data.detroitmi.gov/Public-Safety/DPD-All-Crime-Incidents-2009-Present-Provisional-/b4hw-v6w2\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a>, and Google Maps Direction API, staysafewith.me proposes an optimized travel path that takes into consideration the relative safety of an area. By taking in a start and end location, much like Google Maps does, staysafewith.me will provide path suggestions based on the records of violence in certain areas - it will help you which route is the safest to take.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We started of by parsing the large amounts of raw data given by the Detroit Public Safety Department. A lot of this was very applicable data; however, based on the time restraints given we had to choose the most relevant parts to analyze and implement. With a JSON file of over 1.4 million lines, we started off by processing the raw location-based data into usable information via Python. More specifically, we parsed for longitude and latitude coordinates of crimes.</p>\n<p>Then, we converted this into a serviceable graph which represented Detroit by plotting longitude and latitude coordinates. This made it very easy to convert into a crime heat map and compare with the data that Google Directions API provides us. </p>\n<p>The final step of the journey was making a front-end service that was easy to use and aesthetically appealing to users. We had to plot our routes onto an interactive map of Detroit and suggest which paths were safer. In the end, through Namecheap's web-hosting services, we were able to make our website openly accessible to all users. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>First and foremost, our spontaneously created team. The 4 of us came to MHacks without teammates and, through the power of friendship, became an unbreakable unit. All jokes aside, working with strangers who have had different backgrounds and different abilities was one of the most challenging, yet rewarding parts of this entire hackathon. Also, node.js was a pain.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The power of friendship and node.js</p>\n<h2>What's next for StaySafeWith.me</h2>\n<p>There are countless possibilities for staysafewith.me to expand. An interesting idea suggested by another hacker was to consider the time of day. Some areas might have crime that occurs more frequently during day than night.

Comically, the editor has a 'combo' meter, going up the longer you type, with some special effects happening if you get to a high enough combo. Then, recently, a friend introduced me to an Atom extension called 'Power Mode', which has your cursor explode with color as you type. After being exposed to these, I really wanted to make something that went above and beyond, creating even cooler effects!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Power Mode Turbo is an unconventional text editor. It is mostly opengl (wrapped by openFrameworks) and uses event listeners to grab input and display it on the screen. The fun part about this is that everything you see will be energetic and colorful. The text is constantly bouncing up and down, the editor keeps saying motivational remarks, and there are a plethora of colorful effects to keep you entertained. Following in the footsteps of 'Code in the Dark', this program has a combo meter, which exposes flashier effects the higher it gets. Note that while it can be used for actual work, its real purpose is to be as entertaining and interesting as possible.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built it in Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2015, using openFrameworks for most of the visuals.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The challenging part was trying to figure out how I could make my original idea work (that is, to get a universal desktop version of this, instead of being run in its own window.) I eventually gave up, as it was too low level and time consuming to accomplish in one weekend. For this implementation, there was some trickiness when it came to getting used to programming, as I am new to both C++ and openFrameworks.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of the visual effect in the background in 'turbo mode' (a combo of 200 or more). It had initially started out as me messing around in openFrameworks, and I ended up making a really neat effect of a sin wave wrapping around in a circle with an increasing radius.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I gained a better understanding of C++ and openFrameworks, and got some interesting insight in how some effects can be rendered.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Power Mode Turbo</h2>\n<p>It won't be easy, but a universal desktop version of the app. openFrameworks does not support rendering to the desktop, and it is difficult to render effectively using pure openGL. I intend to read up on the windows api a lot, as I hope to make this vision a reality one day. For the openFrameworks project, I intend to brush up the code a lot as it is pretty sloppy in its current form.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">openframeworks</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mrm8391/PowerModeTurbo\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mrm8391/PowerModeTurbo\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mrm8391/PowerModeTurbo/raw/master/PowerModeTurbo.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mrm8391/PowerModeTurbo/raw/master/PowerModeTurbo.zip\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Detrostrat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Detrostrat \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/172/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Game Screen</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Detrostrat</h1>\n<p>Mhacks 2016 - Gamifying Detroit Open Data to help/entertain the city.</p>\n<p>Detrostrat is a tower defence game that is built on top of google maps.

Hear the world.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I met Yousef, A blind student at the University of Michigan when he asked me for help getting to his class a couple weeks back when Tim Caine came speak on campus. There were tents and vehicles all around the diag our main avenue between classes and Yousef couldn't navigate the new environment without bumping into everything. His cane might catch something but his head would catch what he missed. </p>\n<p>He said new environments were almost impossible for him to navigate without getting lost or banging himself up a lot, even with his white cane. But in an age of autonomous cars and 3d sound shouldn't the blind be able to detect the objects around them?</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We are using the Kinect to make a realtime 3D map of the immediate environment and create a sound map of the objects in it. Based on where objects such as walls, people, and everything else are in relation to you we ping the object with a sound in your 3D environment based on its proximity and direction from you. This allows you to track multiple objects around you and successfully navigate from point A to B without sight.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We are using the Microsoft Kinect to make a realtime map of the objects in front of the wearer. We're using the Kinect's IR sensor to get the depth of everything in front of the wearer then bringing this into our algorithm so we can determine where potential objects to avoid are. We then put these coordinates into Unity to determine the sound to assign the object to create the 3D sound the wearer uses to hear where the objects are an avoid them. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The Kinect makes a really bad 3D map and porting that into Unity was not an easy task at all and took us most of the time. Then trying to map the 3D sound onto the Kinect's readings didn't work initially because we couldn't port it into Unity and were trying to do it manually but without much luck. Finally we got it and were able to get the 3D sound map up and running to finally make the project work.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We made something that can actually help really people, like Yousef! That feels awesome! \nPlus we overcame a bunch of obstacles with incompatible systems, new languages, and learned sound design. All in a couple days.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Learned sound design to make something that you can bear hearing for extended periods of time. We also learned Unity, C#, Visual Studio, and basically converted from Apple to Microsoft for the past couple days to learn and execute on this empowering idea.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sound Sense</h2>\n<p>We would love a chance to put this on a hololense and give it to Yousef to try out. We're sure he would be thrilled! \nWe would also like to add a couple more features to make it even more useful for the visually impaired community such as taking a picture and sending it to DeepMind to tell the user what is in front of them. The second feature we would like to add is maps integration so they always know the direction they should be heading.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect\">kinect</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/chhf129/Sound-Sense\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/chhf129/Sound-Sense\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Jot", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Jot \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/948/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Logo</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We got a concept of a personification of a journal, where you can talk in natural language and be remind you when to make an entry in your journal.\nIs almost if your journal were sentient and acted as a interested friend.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>As a chat bot, it uses your Facebook account to communicate and help you express your feelings, and anything else you want to talk with it.\nCan be used as a tool on psychological treatment of depression, or just help you know yourself better.\nAlso allow the user to share their thoughts with family and friends more easily.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used an platform called Chatfuel that creates and setup the facebook Messenger API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning the AI concepts and finding a matching idea to the technology was difficult.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Jot</h2>\n<p>We want to make Jot smarter and broader, making it capable of different questions and in a customized way.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-chat\">facebook-chat</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/talkjot/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/talkjot/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.facebook.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Pair programming", ""]], ["AnimateVR", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jxU_RF1oN_8?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AnimateVR \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/014/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Captured motions can depict anything the user and model are capable of</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AnimateVR \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/365/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>VR translating to animation</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"AnimateVR \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/411/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Virtual Reality allows users to interact with objects and models much more intuitively than seeing a 2D representation on a screen. Our program utilizes that intuition to allow animators and content-creators greater freedom and control in their scenes. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>AnimateVR allows a user to import a character model and manipulate it in 3D. It has a record and replay function that allows a user to record the model's movements and replay it both forwards and backwards. AnimateVR allows rerecording over timelines as well as recording object movements along the same timeline concurrently, letting the user create complex character motions using multiple limbs. Our program also features joint and rigidbody locks that allow the user to lock the rotation and movement of certain joints. Additionally, the user can resize the character model to correspond to their own body for first-person recording of movements. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Unity and the Steam VRTK to build an interaction model and recording interface. We wrote custom scripts for functions we needed such as restricting the ragdoll physics engine and locking joints and objects. Extensive testing was done using the HTC Vive VR system to ensure that all the user interactions were valid and produced the desired results. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Weird rigidbody behaviors from the Unity physics engine, manually having to put joints in imported models, deciding how to record and replay movements, configuring interaction options (fixed joints, concurrent recording)</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We have both linear time recording and concurrent modelling. That means we can both record a linear segment of motion AND 'go back in time' and move a different part of the model, resulting in complex, multiple object movements at the same time that wouldn't be possible normally with 2 hands/controllers (i.e. both legs and both arms moving at the same time). We are also able to lock joints and objects to the user's necessity. Everything is done in VR without the need for a keyboard and mouse.

We solve the problem of those with underused vehicles by connecting those who need a ride with those who would otherwise not have an opportunity to use and facilitating simple car-transferring using near-field communication (NFC) technology. Our product offers a secure and easy way for neighbors to share vehicles within their community. We're Airbnb for cars. </p>\n<p>We built SmartShare to utilize a few new technologies. First, an in-vehicle app we built using GM's APIs on SDKs allows car-owners to signal to their neighbors that they would like to share their car by pushing their GPS location. This GPS location is received by a Flask server we built and hosted on Linode. At the same time, our Android app allows car-borrowers to locate and cars near them. Access to cars is granted to approved car-borrowers using NFC technology, enabling them to enter their borrowed car with a mere tap of their phones on our NFC signal receivers. </p>\n<p>Imagine driving your vehicle to work. Without SmartShare, your vehicle would most likely sit unused for the majority of the day. With SmartShare, the vehicle can help provide many with safe, efficient, and reliable transit.</p>\n<p>Welcome to the future of smarter, shared mobility.</p>\n<p>[1] Triplett, Tim, Robert Santos, and Sandra Rosenbloom. \"American Driving Survey: Methodology and Year One Results, May 2013\u2013May 2014.\" (2015).</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nfc\">nfc</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">peewe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/MarcusHorn/SmartShareMaster\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/MarcusHorn/SmartShareMaster\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I organized our idea genesis and built the in-vehicle app on the GM software development kit (SDK) using various GM APIs, HTML5, CSS, and JS.

Despite rough times, detroit has an undying spirit, one that chicagoans can relate to. We decided to hack the commute after hearing about the unfortunate state of detroit public transit. One of the openning speakers told a story of a very bright young man who was unable to pursue an internship because the distance was unsurmountable. Thus came to our idea... </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our artificially intelligent chat bot, Poolio, enables users to request rides to a wide network of users around them, in the hopes that together they can share rides to work and build community. By doing so, both users contribute to bettering the city's traffic and improving the city's public transit.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Poolio is is built upon the foundation of Microsoft's Bot Framework and LUIS cognitive services. The app is built in C# with 3 parts love and 4 parts blood sweat and tears. We worked in 6 hour sprints. By evaluating, brainstorming, individual and pair programming, we were able to iterate on our product and adapt quickly to a dynamic environment where new ingenious ideas consistently pop up.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We initially worked with GitHub's <em>Hubot</em>, a tool for bot building. Our chat bot was coming along really well and was capable of a number of things including asking the user for their location and thus of determining their location vis-a-vis other users. However, working with <em>Coffee Script</em> for the backend work revealed to be a time-consuming and incredibly challenging task. So we decided to focus our attention to  Microsoft's <em>Botbuilder</em> and its impressive machine-learning <em>LUIS</em>.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Hackathon teams often times devolve into a work horse and some mules. One person may handle the bulk of the labor while their cohorts sleep, play and slack off. Our MHacks team worked consistently and cohesively to achieve our goal, and despite disparities in skill from one area to the next were able to make the most out of our time in Detroit. That is something we are all proud of.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Personally, as this is my second time at a hackathon, I was quite unfamiliar with back-end development. Working with any APIs (whether <em>Google Maps</em> API, <em>ArcGIS</em> or <em>LUIS</em>) or with scripting languanges (<em>JavaScript</em> or <em>Coffee Script</em>), every moment was a wonderful opportunity to challenge myself to learn and grow in my knowlege.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pool I/O</h2>\n<p>We plan to release our chat bot application to slack's integration directory. After which, any organization will be able to reap the benefits of integrated ride-sharing. We <strong>truly</strong> believe in the good that Pool I/O can do for the world, so we plan invest our time into improving the bot and moving the world closer to a <em>shared economy</em>!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">luis</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bot-framework</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-sql-server</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cognitive-processing</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://augustkarlstedt.github.io/poolio/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://augustkarlstedt.github.io/poolio/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>augustkarlstedt.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Minerva", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Minerva \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/421/692/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Editing a Journal Entry</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Minerva \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/423/521/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>Minerva</h1>\n<p>Minerva is a Daily Journal.

As computer scientists committed to making a difference for a marginalized community, our team was excited to use the resources of MHacks to make the world a little friendlier for the visually impaired.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SeeSaw is a mobile app that identifies friends and family of the user. By taking intermittent pictures and comparing the faces to a contact list, the app can tell the user which familiar faces are nearby.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Software Development Kit from Microsoft's Cognitive Services Face Recognition to develop the app from a sample skeleton in Android Studio. The smartphone's camera serves as the means of input and the phone's speaker outputs the result.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Being our first Hackathon, our team was apprehensive about getting started. We had minimal experience with API's, Android Development, and just selecting a project. In addition, we began developing in Java for an Android phone, but the phone's owner had to leave the Hackathon! We were left with four iPhones and an emulator that could not meet our requirements. Special thanks to Max and Jack, whom testing would have been impossible without.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>To gain a better understanding of the API's interface, we implemented a driver program in Python before starting our app. In all honesty, our proudest accomplishment is probably the fact that we made it through the whole Hacking process. Though it's our first legitimate project, we were excited to get behind a meaningful idea and take all the way to the demo.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Our team learned plenty about Android App Development and using professional API's, but overall, we learned how to put together a team project at a Hackathon! Before Friday, none of us could have guessed that we would have made an app that could provide facial recognition support for those in need. In addition, we learned that reaching out for help is especially valuable in an environment like MHacks, where people are brilliant, interested, and just plain friendly.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SeeSaw</h2>\n<p>Our team sees potential for our app to analyze video feeds in real time and be implemented into devices even more convenient than a smartphone. Overall, we hope that SeeSaw is one of many steps in the field of Accessibility Technologies that aim to provide people with more independence and community engagement.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">microsoft-cognitive-services</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["PassTap", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>PassTap</h1>\n<h6><a href=\"http://www.passtap.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.passtap.com</a></h6>\n<p>Our project for MHacks 8.

Tether to your phone using bluetooth or wifi, and make sure that you can ping/contact your phone. I used a static ip on a different subnet mask from the wifi so that I could keep my wifi connection on my laptop, as well as a connection to my phone, as shown in the picture above.</p>\n<p>Print out one of the trackers in trackers.pdf, and place it on your cardboard.</p>\n<p>Deploy the android project, and then start the desktop-launcher project. The phone will vibrate and print out a log message in adb when it connects to the laptop. Put on the cardboard, and face the webcam.</p>\n<p>Move your head without rotating to control the position of your ship, and press the fire button on the cardboard to shoot. You can look around, but if you rotate too far, it will lose the track. If the track is lost, it will pause the game and show you the camera feed so you can re-orient yourself.</p>\n<h2>Game Objects</h2>\n<p>You can shoot enemies (the red circle things) and meteors. If you get hit, the cardboard will vibrate. You must dodge the enemy fire (the red crosses), and the electric fields.</p>\n<p>The green pills give you a life only when you collide with them. If you shoot them, they disappear, so be sure not to just spam the trigger. When you collect a pill or press fire, the phone will vibrate quicker than when you get hit.</p>\n<p>Your points are shown below, and lives above. When you get game-over, you must restart the application.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The desktop application accepts a tcp connection from the phone, and sends the position of your head. It uses boofcv to track you. When the outline is red, it is using the fiducial tracker (boofcv's name for the black and white tracker). When it is green, it has lost the track and is looking at the texture to guess where you are until it finds the fiducial again. If it does not find a fiducial within 1 second, it pauses the game and shows you the camera.</p>\n<p>On the phone, I used Libgdx to handle the graphics. While I still use mostly opengl calls, it handles things like loading textures. I decided that I wanted to use a lower-level library so I could learn more about opengl.</p>\n<p>I used an ancient version of the Cardboard library, before google hid the source code, because I want to be able to learn from it.</p>\n<h2>Challenges and Things I Learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting libgdx and the cardboard libraries to work with each other and with gradle was a pain. I had to modify both of the open-source projects that I used to get it to work.</li>\n<li>Getting the head tracking to work when you move quickly was a bit tricky. I outlined my approach above.</li>\n<li>I am not good at game design, and even though I've worked with cardboard and libgdx before, this is by far the most complete game I've ever built.</li>\n<li>The code is a mess. Sorry.</li>\n<li>I learned so much about opengl (especially why my alpha blending wasn't working) and android surface textures (to view the camera stream)</li>\n<li>I tried doing the motion tracking on the phone with boofcv, but it was far too slow.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to incorporate the head tracking with an old game like DOOM</li>\n<li>I originally wanted to make a wireless controller with the ESP8266 that would shock you when you got hit.

All the different art that could be made by rotating a graph around an axis was astonishing, so I deciding to try to recreate that a bit here.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This program allows users a range of freedom in turning any line they have in the classic y = mx + b into a cone or conic section. With as little information as the slope and y-intercept or as many as 6 variables, users are able to choose exactly where the rotation ought to occur and how far up and down the graph should show.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I designed this program using some of MatLabs built in plotting functions and using matrices and vectors to figure out the area to span and how high each point within that area should be.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The two main challenges I ran into were getting a nice solid cone established and sorting out how to make cones work upside down in relation to the sign of the slope. In other words, figuring out exactly how to make the math work so that the graph displays the full cone or conic section without cutting any of it off or leaving a lot of extra space was rather troublesome. Getting the slopes to work was rather tricky as having a negative slope would often result in either a flat surface or none at all. The trick, silly as it was on my end, is a matter of making sure the inputs are such that the window of the graph will actually display the cone.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This was my first hackathon and I came here fresh from an interview trip, so I was already pretty tired and a bit CS'd out before the event even started. Though I struggled a lot with a couple other ideas before settling on this one, I'm proud I was able to make something somewhat presentable within the timeframe while still being able to venture out and learn about a bunch of different software.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I got a lot better at manipulating matrices and thinking within their context throughout this project. I just started taking linear algebra in college, so that whole area of math is rather new to me. Learning how to manipulate and work with vectors and matrices from a more mathematical perspective was a lot of fun and I think it will be very useful for me this quarter.</p>\n<h2>What's next for 3 Dimensional Linear Rotations</h2>\n<p>I'm considering expanding the project to be able to handle more different kinds of graphs, like parabolas, cubic functions, trigonometric functions, and maybe even things like logs. Furthermore, though it is minor, I'd like to expand the colormap some more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/matlab\">matlab</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CerJesus/Hackathons\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/CerJesus/Hackathons\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Big Data Camera", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5PFdlpOMe4E?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Big Data Camera \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/871/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>homepage of website</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Big Data Camera \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/855/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>gender distribution</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Big Data Camera \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/422/872/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>age distribution</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Computer vision can revolutionize the whole world.

The Microsoft Face API is able to gain <strong>age and gender</strong> for each face in the picture uploaded.Our application can upload a large amount of photos automatically and analyze the data. Then it  stores the information of customers for companies and shows charts of data on webpage.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Using visual stdio, we developed our program with c#. The most important part of our project is <strong>Face Detection</strong> which can detect human faces in an image and returns face locations, and optionally with faceIds, landmarks, and attributes. This time, we only focus on returning some of attributes such as age and gender which are useful for companies.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable camera to automatically take photos of people when camera receives signal(Manually for the demo)</li>\n<li>Use Microsoft-Face-API to collect information of customers with the photos</li>\n<li>Analyze the data of customers and convert the data into charts</li>\n<li>Build a website which shows statistical charts with html5.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>First time to use c#, and html5.

It was an effective use of the present technology.</p>\n<p>Today, more than 60 year's after its introduction, nearly every CNC machine (and most 3D printers) in the world still relies on G-Code. Despite several orders of magnitude of technological advancement in hardware and software, G-Code is still the standard.</p>\n<p>In a modern CNC workflow, G-Code is clunky, confusing, limited in functionality, and arguably dangerous to use. Reliance on arbitrarily enumerated machine commands leads to an extremely high learning curve, unclear program purpose, and ambiguous flow. It's confusing to write, and especially hard to read. It's also severely limited in functionality due specifically to its age.</p>\n<p>Our team of CS and MEs have well over 6 cumulative years of CNC experience and software development. We know G-Code is not a viable solution to advance manufacturing. We were convinced we could make an elegant programming interface designed for modern machine controllers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>openCAM is an extensible Python framework for interfacing with your CNC machine. It's designed to run natively on your new/upgraded machine. It's also backwards compatible with older machines and can export a functionally equivalent G-Code program (to the extent of functionality currently supported by G-Code).</p>\n<p>Even simple machine operations in G-Code can be hundreds of lines long and impossible to follow or tweak. On the contrary, once you've defined an operation in openCAM, it can be re-used throughout all your parts in just one or two lines of code. This is because openCAM focuses on procedural abstraction, so you can write your machine paths in terms of operations that you're actually interested in, and let whoever wrote that operation care about the details. That might be yourself from the past, it might be someone down the hall, or it might be someone writing an open source library of threading profiles.</p>\n<p>Unlike G-Code, openCAM was built to be object oriented. Our innovative approach to patterning and transformation makes it an incredibly fluid and powerful tool for artists, engineers, and machinists.</p>\n<p>Anyone can easily leverage openCAM to their unique needs. Python gives you immediate access to numpy, openCV, Django, and hundreds of other widely supported frameworks. For the first time, it's easy to add QA to a mill bed and adjust cutting operations on the fly. Networking machines together is made simple, empowering numerical analysis and targeted throttling of production. Or, if Twitter is your thing, there are APIs for that too. This flexibility empowers creativity and innovation in design and R/D, and can save hundreds of hours of wasted time on manufacturing lines.</p>\n<p><strong>openCAM revolutionizes the CNC industry.</strong></p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our framework was built in Python. We worked to design and implement a set of composable types that lets you hierarchically define geometry. Geometry can then be cut simply by applying a position to an established shape. Behind the curtain, we created a library for creating lines of GCode that does not depend on remembering code numbers. Our development cycle involved constant prototyping of our framework and compiler on desktop CNC mills we brought to the Hardware Cortex. We prototyped openCAM with a CAMotics simulator and a Roland SRM-20 Desktop Mill.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Hardware is hard. In order to prove our framework, we needed to run it on actual CNC machines. We received a number or machines from vendors and OEMs sponsoring our team. Unfortunately, these are complex machines and they are especially hard to ship. We lost many hours on Friday and Saturday before we could determine that one of our machines was missing critical components.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We've received tremendous support from the manufacturing industry. We initially reached out asking for loaner machines for a quirky hackathon project. We were blown away by how many machines we were offered. We've held several teleconferences and discussions with leading OEMs discussing the uniqueness and potential capability of our product. </p>\n<p>Despite hardware complications with our machines and delays in the timely development of efficient data structures, we were able to achieve the most complicated element of our project in a matter of hours. We initially set a stretch goal of multi-op 3D carving, but due to smart planning and an incredible dev team, we confidently pursued this goal and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1Khhs0p8EHk\" rel=\"nofollow\">completed it prior to most of our other goals.</a></p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>openCAM is designed to work with whatever geometry you give it. It should be able to handle milling an extruded rectangle just as easily as carving text with a provided font. We spent most of our planning time developing data structures and procedures for responsibly handling troublesome geometry. Circular and and rectangular bores were easy to handle, but arbitrary patterns and user-defined geometry caused issues with all of our early DS concepts. Properly separating theses notions of geometry (which can actually be manufactured) from patterns (which determine where various pieces of geometry get placed) ended up being the system we needed to be able to write intuitive code for somewhat more complex parts.</p>\n<h2>What's next for openCAM</h2>\n<p>Our goal for openCAM has always been to help new users start CNCing, and to empower veteran users to get the most out of their existing tool and workflow. We are incredibly excited to see how the industry uses openCAM.</p>\n<p>openCAM was initially designed for 3-axis CNC mills. However, this is just a subset of CNC machines the world depends on. openCAM's modularity in handling operations as objects should make it straightforward to start interfacing with other CNC machine tools.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cnc</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cad</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cam</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">iot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">framework</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/openCAMdev\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://twitter.com/openCAMdev\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>twitter.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/OpenCAMGroup/mhacks-prototype\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/OpenCAMGroup/mhacks-prototype\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I managed the project and was heavily involved in framework design.

Now street parking is much better than parking garages as it is cheaper and in fact even free after certain hours in the evening. I wanted to make the openly available data of street parallel parking spots available to the masses</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>So the idea is to hookup a camera on the side of a bus. The reason I chose a bus is that they frequent a lot in the downtown area and cover most of the hotspot commercial area streets where people end up looking for parking. So my camera on the bus clicks an image of the curbside and processes it my algorithm written using Microsoft Computer Vision API under Microsoft Cognitive Services, to detect which spot has a car and which is empty. This data is transmitted to an iOS app which has a layout of the street.  Based on the data, the parking spots on the screen turn red or green.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I built the backend using Microsoft Computer Vision API under Microsoft Cognitive Services using python and Flask.

Here, we take data on the car\u2019s speed and steering wheel position to calculate centripetal acceleration when taking a turn, and linear acceleration when applying the gas or brakes. We then check these values for accelerations outside of our comfort threshold (0.5Gs) and use this to calculate the user\u2019s driving score accordingly. The UI is an HTML page rendered in the car\u2019s operating system.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Calculating the feeling that the driver feels when turning proved to be initially difficult. There was no API available for this so we had to calculate it ourselves. As the user increases in speed, an increase in the degree of turn is felt more by people in the car. Conversely, the same acceleration can be felt at a lower speed but with a sharper turn. We tried several different relationships to model this feeling before deciding to calculate centripetal acceleration. Measuring the force was ruled out because it is dependent on the mass of the thing being accelerated which isn\u2019t constant or known. Acceleration on the other hand could be represented in Gs which is something most people are familiar with.</p>\n<p>We initially tried calculating turning radius based on the angular velocity (yaw), linear velocity of the car, and time to take a 360 degree turn, but we couldn\u2019t get all of these data points without data from an actual car so we used a representative turning radius of 10m (~35ft). From this value, we then decided to take the ratio of the steering wheel angle to the maximum steering angle to calculate effective turning radius. Once this is calculated we were finally able to calculate the centripetal acceleration because it is proportional to the square of the linear (tangential) velocity and inversely proportional to the turning radius.\nAccomplishments that we're proud of</p>\n<p>We are proud of our app\u2019s ability to calculate both accelerations that can be felt. This helps notify the user when their driving is likely uncomfortable to passengers, or just plain unsafe, and in turn help make new drivers better and safer.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Physics and why everyone hates math in JavaScript.\nWhat's next for SafeTrip</p>\n<p>Pivoting the focus to not just new drivers but also more experienced or T&amp;LC drivers looking to maintain a high level of passenger comfort.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">blood</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sweat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tears</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gm-sdk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/npm\">npm</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Implemented grading algorithm and researched and completed acceleration calculations.", "Design research and development.

We realized, however, that this wasn't scalable within 36 hours especially due to limits with retrieving all of the data that we'd need. Other issues include problems with certain technology that we originally intended to use.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud that we were able to successfully build our project with plenty of time left to spare for testing and to make changes and improvements. Everybody went super hard the first night to ensure that a good amount of the project was done so I'm proud of my teammates for grinding through this hackathon. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a bit of technology but even more this weekend, I learned about how to work with a team. We bounced ideas off of each other, talked through everything, and did what we needed to implement. I got a better idea of tech in the \"real world\" and as always at hackathons, learned so much more this weekend than I ever would have sitting in a lecture.</p>\n<h2>What's next for TranSafe</h2>\n<p>As briefly mentioned above, there are quite a few additional features we'd like to add given more time to work on it. These include finding and being able to filter routes based on wait times, whether the bus has cameras or not, weather updates that may affect routes, and a more detailed schedule with an accurate ETA. Given more time to get all of this data and implement it, there could be some major improvements made with people's experience with public transportation in Detroit. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://transafe.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://transafe.org\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>transafe.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [".
