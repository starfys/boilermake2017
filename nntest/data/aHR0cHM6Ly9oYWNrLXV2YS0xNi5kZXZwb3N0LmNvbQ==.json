The volume and availability of news has grown exponentially through social media and more young people than ever before are engaging with political candidates. However, news can come from anywhere and articles that are shared on social media tend to be polarizing or biased towards one side.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>barometr is a Chrome extension that measures the political bias in articles. We measure it in two ways: bias indicator and sentiment analysis. The bias indicator notes the party leaning of the articles. The sentiment analysis indicates whether the article is postive or negative. We use a barometer, or scale, to make the measurements to most accurately educate our users in a visually appealing way. And barometr improves over time as we have created a machine learning model.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>MACHINE LEARNING MODEL - NEURAL NETWORK</p>\n<p>To determine political bias, we have created a neural network. Essentially what we do is pull each word from an article and create a new node for that word. At first that node is given an arbitrary value from 0 to 1 (0 being no right bias and 1 being strongly right biased). That node is also given a weight. All the nodes in the article are summed up to give a final score from 0 to 1 which determines the overall article bias. As more articles are looked at, our model learns. That is how our bias indicator improves over time. The model adjusts it's weights and values accordingly. </p>\n<p>The neural network model powers Barometr on the backend to serve bias indicator and sentiment measurements for the articles.</p>\n<p>CHROME EXTENTION</p>\n<p>We created a Chrome extension through web development in Javascript and HTML. The biggest challenge was realizing and designing the extension architecture. </p>\n<p>Our control flow begins with content.js in the extension. The content.js file retrieves the text from the website the user is currently reading. We read the text by essentially considering each webpage as a tree. Our code does a DFS traversal to extract the element and then the node, or text, within the element. As we extract the text, we build a JSON output string. We then send the JSON output to the server for processing. </p>\n<p>Once the server has processed the webpage text and performed the analysis, we GET the JSON output through the popup.js file in the extension. The JSON is then input into the barometer UI code which renders the extension popup visualization. </p>\n<p>The general architecture is reflected in the main manifest.json file. Here we indicate the default_popup as popup.html which is our popup UI that has popup.js in the backend. Our content script is content.js which is the script that pulls the text from the webpage.</p>\n<p>AMAZON WEB SERVICES</p>\n<p>We set up an EC2 node to host our services. The AWS node is our server backend where we receive and send information to. This is how our Chrome extension is connected to our neural network.</p>\n<h2>What's next</h2>\n<p>Lunch</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">extension</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://ec2-52-91-18-68.compute-1.amazonaws.com/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://ec2-52-91-18-68.compute-1.amazonaws.com/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ec2-52-91-18-68.compute-1.amazonaws.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front end including implementing JustGage.js plugin as well as all HTML, CSS, and Javascript formatting.

They claim to offer end-to-end encrypted chat, but with no easy way of inspecting their source, users were left with no real choice but to blindly trust them.</p>\n<p>Keybase RPC empowers application developers by giving them easy access to (1) authentication of users and (2) encrypted transmission of arbitrary messages. </p>\n<p>We were able to implement a simple chat client just like Telegram's in just 20 lines of code using Keybase RPC, and its architecture is general enough to allow many different kinds of apps as well.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Keybase RPC exposes a dead-simple API to application developers that provides encryption and authentication for message passing with <em>no expectation</em> that the application developer know anything about cryptography: all that's required is a Keybase Filesystem and a Keybase RPC installation. The application developer then uses just two methods, <code>on_message</code> and <code>send_message</code>, to interact with Keybase RPC. That's it!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/9gX1zE8.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--PZh6wdQ0--/http://i.imgur.com/9gX1zE8.png\"/></p>\n<p>Keybase RPC is a layer on top of Keybase Filesystem, an open-source service. An encrypted filesystem appears on the machine at <code>/keybase</code>, and all files shared here are automatically signed and encrypted for transmission to either (1) the world, e.g. at /keybase/public/lgessler, or (2) specific people, e.g. /keybase/private/lgessler,tondwalkar,prestwood. Keybase RPC uses this filesystem to pass messages and abstracts away the details for the clients.</p>\n<p>We wrote Keybase RPC in Python 3. We used a client-server model for local machine connections, where the \"server\" is the program that communicates with KBFS, and \"clients\" are applications that ask the server to write to KBFS on their behalf. Server-client communication is achieved with UNIX FIFO's, i.e. named pipes, and keybase-server communication is accomplished with simple filesystem writes.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>KBFS is streamed on demand, not automatically mirrored like Dropbox, so we had to come up with a way to know when there was a new message a remote client had created. We ended up going with the simplest solution, polling the directory. FIFO's also require special care to read from and write into: every FIFO edge in the diagram above had to be implemented with a thread to avoid blocking the main thread.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We abstracted away a <em>lot</em> of details for application developers: all an implementing developer has to do in Python is to inherit from a Client class and (1) override its <code>on_message</code> function and (2) use its <code>send_message</code> function. Application developers don't need to know <em>anything</em> about cryptography to have reasonable assurance (assuming they trust the people at Keybase and us, the authors of Keybase RPC, or trust that they have read our code well).</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Keybase RPC (kbrpc)</h2>\n<p>Refactoring</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">keybase-filesystem</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lgessler/kbrpc\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lgessler/kbrpc\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped pair program", "", ""]], ["HoosHungry", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HoosHungry \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/365/903/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our inspiration roots in the success of Uber and Airbnb, behind which is the rapid expansion of C2C market.
