The internet can be very useful, but due to its anonymity, it can also be used for cyberbullying and for posting vulgar and offensive content. We wanted to develop a way to let online users know whether the content of the page they are visiting is considered offensive. To do this effectively, we incorporated various apis and aggregated metrics that help to better inform the user.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SurfShield is a chrome extension. When a user visits a site, the SurfShield icon will change colors to display the level of offensive content on the page with green representing little to no offensive content and red representing a high level of offensive content. When the user clicks on the SurfShield icon, the extension will display an overall score, which is between 1 and 5. This score is averaged from from our four main metrics, which are anger, cyberbullying, profanity, and if users have voted on that particular site, an audience score. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built SurfShield by creating a Chrome Extension using javascript, html5, and css3. The API calls are made in Python. Using Amazon Web Services, we process the results and then update the UI of the chrome extension with the anger, cyberbullying, profanity, audience score, and overall score. The SurfShield icon also changes colors based on the overall score. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One main challenge we had was determining where the API calls would be made and the results processed. It was also challenging to integrate the separate parts that we all worked on to create a functioning Chrome Extension. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud that we've created an extension that will help those who are worried about viewing offensive content on the web. We imagine that many parents would like to have this extension for Chrome, so that there kids can surf the web in a safer environment. The extension is useful for anyone that wants a better and safer experience on the web. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about the Watson Tone Analyzer as well as the Bark API, which greatly assisted us in our goal of determining the level of offensive content on a website. We all collaboratively worked together and used our own knowledge to make the Chrome Extension.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for SurfShield</h2>\n<p>SurfShield has great potential. We believe that in the future, it could allow parents to set it up so that if a site has a score above a threshold, it will block that site from use, so that children can surf the web without their parents having to look over their shoulder. In this case, the service could be monetized and sold on a monthly subscription basis. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">watson-tone-analyzer</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">bark.us-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">aws-elastic-beanstalk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-rds-relational-database-service\">amazon-rds-relational-database-service</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-route-53\">amazon-route-53</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pip</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">virtualenv</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dado3212/hackdartmouth\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dado3212/hackdartmouth\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Line at KAF", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kWWI4AWPgac?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Dartmouth students love KAF (King Arthur Flour) \nIt is the one place where students can get quality coffee during their busy school hours. \nHowever, KAF at the Baker-Berry library is infamous for its long lines, easily extending beyond the entrance making students wait 20~30minutes for a cup of joe.\nThat's why we built lineatkaf.com so that students can be aware of the length of the queue at KAF at any point in time. \nNow students can easily check the queue to avoid long lines at KAF and exploit times when the line is short. \nIt saves time for students and improves customer experience to benefit the business as well. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Sensors installed at KAF measure the length of the queue and continuously updates the website, lineatkaf.com, where students can check the length of the queue. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Arduino Ultrasonic Sensors to detect the length of the line. \nThe data is preprocessed in Python then uploaded onto a MongoDB\nwhere our website, built on Meteor, Ruby, and Javascript can access the the DB in real time \nand display the length of the line in easy to understand format .</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The sensitivity of the sensors was less than we hoped for but we were able to create an algorithm to overcome the noisiness of the data. We hope to improve the stability of our system with better, more stable sensors in the near future.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Teamwork. We didn't have experience with Arduino before but we were able to figure out how to use it as a team. \nWe were able to each focus on parts of the project that we are good at to save time as well as learn from each other on what they do best. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that the Hackathon is a great place to do great projects, meet and learn from new people. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Line at KAF</h2>\n<p>We are excited to purchase better, stable sensors and design a more aesthetically pleasing website so that Dartmouth students can make daily use of our service. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://pure-beach-56896.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://pure-beach-56896.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pure-beach-56896.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ejolly/lineAtKaf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ejolly/lineAtKaf\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lineatkaf.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://lineatkaf.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>lineatkaf.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["bee there", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>immersive 3D environments should be easy and beautiful</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>voice control of a HTC VIVE scene.

A single visit, for those with lower insurance can range from $80-200, depending on the severity of the condition. Seeing this as a huge problem, we ventured on the mission to bring affordable medical diagnoses to the homes of real people.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Rather than completely replacing the physician, AlexaMD serves to diagnose more common and minuscule conditions, may it be the common cold or the flu. However, she is also trained to diagnose larger, and more series conditions. AlexaMD works by engaging in real conversations with the patient. She is activated when the patient tells her that he/she isn't feeling well, and after a short conversation, she can report on the condition, or send the patient to a doctor for further diagnosis. We do realize that computer-based diagnoses are not completely accurate, so Dr. Alexa will always recommend the doctor.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>AlexaMD consists of 3 main systems: the Amazon Echo, AWS Lambda, AlexaAPI. The Amazon Echo is the central point of communication between Dr. Alexa and the patient. Through the Echo, we are able to not only get patient symptom input, but also return real human phrases to the patient to provide genuine interactions. One step behind the Echo, we have our AWS Lambda instance. We used Lambda to actually outline the conversation between the Echo and the patient. Essentially, we had expected phrases on Lambda used to gain user feedback, and based on that feedback we made API calls to retrieve the correct diagnoses. Lastly, we built an API for Alexa on AWS EC2 that was able to take in symptoms, and generate the most likely problems. We used a 3rd party API to grab potential illnesses and then ranked them for the patient. In the API, we also implemented our own natural language processing algorithm so that we could have more natural conversations with the patient.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenges we ran into were with Amazon Lambda and our API creation. It was our first time working with the Echo, and we were not too familiar with the technology. The biggest challenge with Lambda that we had was making sure that the exact symptoms we wanted were parsed, and the interaction wouldn't be awkward. Going off of that, on the API side, the biggest challenge we ran into was the natural language processing. As many medical terms are long and difficult for the common person, we wanted to make sure that we could not only have an effective system, but also ensure that the conversation was smooth.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Overall, we are most proud of building something that has a real potential to help people. With our 24 hours of work, we were able to create a device capable of providing a service to people at a price point that's very affordable. In addition to the impact of our work, we are equally proud of the technology feats. We were able to build a full stack system, where we not only implemented natural language process from scratch, but we also allowed for fast, and seamless user experience.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As with any hackathon, this one was also filled with learning. For all of us, it was the first time really working with Lambda, and for many members of the team, AWS. Additionally, we learned about the difficulty and cool algorithmic nature of NLP, and will definitely do more with it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for AlexaMD</h2>\n<p>AlexaMD is just the beginning of a medical revolution. We strive to bring major feats to healthcare that can truly help real people. We believe that by using the advanced devices we have today (like Fitbits, Smart Watches, etc), we can combine them with the huge database of information, to bring the best and most innovative solutions for tomorrow. With AlexaMD, we were able to use one of these amazing technology devices, so in the future, we strive to do so much more.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-ec2\">amazon-ec2</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">amazon-lambda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Demolisty24/AlexaMD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Demolisty24/AlexaMD\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mayankmmmx/AlexaMD-Backend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mayankmmmx/AlexaMD-Backend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hackdartmouth16-site-needmorecowbell.c9users.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://hackdartmouth16-site-needmorecowbell.c9users.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackdartmouth16-site-needmorecowbell.c9users.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on data analysis and natural language mapping", "Worked on configuring/extensively testing Alexa and writing the supporting Amazon Lambda function.", "Web Development", "", ""]], ["AlcoSafe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It is important to be sure that your drinks are Dartmouth approved to ensure that you are drinking responsibly; however, often drinks are not labeled with their alcohol content, and students have no way of knowing whether or not the alcohol content is too high.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Measures the alcohol content of a drink and flashes a green light if less than 40 proof and red if higher than 40 proof.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used an arduino 101 board with alcohol sensor and ultrasonic atomizer that outputs to two LEDs and an LCD display. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>MLH rents out Arduino 101, and Thayer school of Engineering provides Arduino Unos.

Furthermore, there is an informational video describing the events leading up to his death, and the repercussions it had on society. Perhaps most importantly, there is an interactive simulation allowing the user to enjoy the definitive Harambe experience. This impressively high-resolution game simulates Harambe's final moments, before he was so cruelly taken from us. The keyboard is used to move the protagonist, as he avoids the onslaught of bullets from the zookeeper. In addition, the user must deftly navigate the zoo enclosure in order to save as many children as possible.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>All images were created or heavily edited using GIMP. We'd like to thank GIMP for providing such an easy-to-use interface and friendly customer experience. We created the game using Phaser and Javascript. The website uses HTML, CSS, the Twitter API, and jQuery.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge was the sprite sheet. We ran into several issues with ensuring transparency between the figures, and separating them so artifacts from neighboring figures did not appear as part of the active sprite.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We formed a team of four members who had never met before. We successfully divided responsibilities, then worked together to combine all the parts of the beautiful tribute we created. We are especially proud that this tribute allows the user to not only learn more about our inspiration, but also experience what his final moments were like. This allows the user to gain empathy for this poor gorilla's struggles, as they can now truly relate.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Phaser, some new CSS tricks, advanced image editing, how to create sprite sheets, and even more about this influential political figure.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Save the Children</h2>\n<p>The next iteration would be an interactive, Virtual reality experience allowing the user to relive Harambe's final moments and witness them through the eyes of our hero himself, the child, the zookeeper, or a spectator.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phaser-js\">phaser.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.harambae.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.harambae.org\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.harambae.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I designed the website that surrounds the game.", "I was the \"resource\" guy and made/modified character models for the game.", "", ""]], ["whm", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"whm \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/852/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>whm</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>To untether social media from profiles and static locations</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It allows users to view and post about what's going on around them.

Currently, patient records are isolated and requesting medical records  takes time. Personally, I've had to jump through hoops to get my medical records from the hospital, to my doctor, and then to my specialist. The current system is too inefficient. This problem is compounded when going to another country - my records would be nonexistent causing even more inconvenience for both the doctor and patient.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Polymer uses blockchain technology to allow doctors to store patient records on the immutable blockchain. To access the blockchain, each doctor has a public address which is verified against private keys. He will then be able to add, edit and search for patients - their past medical history and a chronological list of every interaction that the patient has ever had with every doctor in their lives. Since the data is on the blockchain, it is firstly decentralized, meaning no one organisation is in control of the data, and secondly, unalterable and hence there is no risk of it being tampered with.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Polymer is built upon the Ethereum blockchain. The demo requires Web3, which is injected into the web browser via a Chrome extension called Metamask.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Working with the blockchain, which is such a nascent technology, is difficult. We had to figure about allowing the web browser to interact with Metamask, verifying private keys and allowing transactions to be added on the testnet.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of / What we learned</h2>\n<p>We believe strongly that the medical industry is in need of improvement and our hack was created to reflect that vision. We combined this passion with our knowledge and enthusiasm for blockchain technology to create something we hope will have a long-lasting and positive impact on society not only across North America but the world.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Polymer</h2>\n<p>We hope that Polymer can reach greater heights by having medical organisations and hospitals adopt this technology and create a better healthcare industry for citizens across the world. Furthermore, we would like to explore the option of uploading smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing other forms of use cases for doctors to safely store and access their patients' data</p>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["VeriRoute", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"VeriRoute \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/740/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>What it does:\nVeriRoute is a unique transportation application that allows users to not only identify the quickest path to their destination, but also various safety metrics that characterize each route. When their route is selected, we utilize EverQuote\u2019s anonymous database which characterize various dangerous behaviors, such as phone usage, speeding, acceleration, and braking, along the latitude and longitude locations that characterize their route. We utilize data that represents the frequency of crime-related incidents along the route as well, and compile all of these metrics to provide a subjective, weighted score to depict the safety of each route. The aim is to provide users, particularly those unfamiliar with the areas they are venturing into, with an added measure of security. </p>\n<p>How we built it: \nWe obtained a database from EverQuote, which contained data over a period of time that identified when people at each specific latitude and longitude location were either speeding, accelerating, using their phone, or braking. Each of these points were anonymous, and we used JavaScript to parse this data file to both obtain points within a 0.5 mile radius along the route, and applied a subjective weighting system to characterize the score based on the density of each of the four events described above. We then overlapped crime data in the same fashion, and applied a final score based on this data.</p>\n<h1>Challenges We Ran Into:</h1>\n<p>A major challenge we ran into that limited the reliability and capability of the application was the limited amount of data we had to work with. This made it difficult to scale our idea, since we only had a limited batch of locations and a limited time frame in which the data was collected. \nAnother major limitation we ran into was the lack of immediate availability of comprehensive crime data. Much of this data was gathered in or around metropolitan areas, so the scope in which we could extrapolate results was severely diminished. This also offered a scalability challenge, since the scores would be skewed unfairly if the route took an individual through a major city. </p>\n<h1>Accomplishments that we're proud of:</h1>\n<p>We were thrilled to get the application up and running at the level it is at. Two of our team members were first-time hackathon participants, so there was a lot of explanation and instruction along with writing code and fleshing out the idea. However, we were happy that we were able to take a large static data set and actually create something of immediate use for those concerned about theirs, or their families safety when travelling. We also are very excited about the various ways in which we can scale our idea. </p>\n<h1>Future Scalability and Usage of VeriRoute:</h1>\n<p>VeriRoute was designed in such a way that it can be scaled for a larger and larger area based on the amount of information in a given CSV file. As more and more CSV data is provided to us by EverQuote, more and more accurate routing predictions will be given by VeriRoute. Also, increasing the amount of  comprehensive crime data around the U.S fed to VeriQuote will provide it with a means to provide more accurate routing predictions.\nInternational Scalability can be achieved as well, provided that accurate crime data in the nation is released to the general public.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js\">leaflet.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mapquest-directions\">mapquest-directions</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-places\">google-places</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/saipriyajyothula/hackdart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.github.com/saipriyajyothula/hackdart\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I helped work on the API Integration with MapQuest using JSON,JavaScipt and the Leaflet framework for JS, and write the CSS for the site.\nI learned a ton about API Usage while working,and strengthened my bases in CSS which was awesome", "I helped work on the data analytics to contextualize each route, and specifically assisted in designing the algorithm to compile the safety metric.

The front end application is a native iOS app written in objective-C. We utilized the MapBox API to display and style our map.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Heroku does not like running Spark/Java applications. On each deployment, Heroku assigns an arbitrary port number for applications to run on, and if it doesn't bind to that port in 60 seconds, the dyno sleeps. We fixed this by hosting on a home server using Ngrok and Tmux.</p>\n<p>On the iOS side, we ran into issues with map customization and switched from using Apple's MapKit framework to MapBox, an alternative which allows for greater customization. We also ran into some issues with networking and with animation rendering.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We put a lot of hard work into designing the minimap screen itself.
