We want to make the video artistic as well, so we create Re:Art.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Re:Art is a Web App that aims to transform a video into an animated artwork by furnishing it with a particular style or pattern of paint chosen by the user. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Back-end:</strong>\nBy utilizing the open-source VGG19 neural network model and Torch Framework, We set up a comprehensive back-end still image stylization service based on the AWS and G2 instance in the EC2 service. We achieve the non-linear video processing result through Open CV (Open Source Computer Vision), which enable the web app Re:Art allowing users to process a self-designed animated artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>FlowChart</strong></p>\n<p>Read user input:\nWhen a user uploads a video and chooses a picture style, we will read in the video and style they choose, and we will decide the frame number based on how long we want the output gif file to be.</p>\n<p>Transform the video:\nWe pick up the images based on the frame rate, and then crop the images into the size with the ratio 8.5:11, which is roughly 300px * 388px. Also, we uses advanced compression algorithm to make the image further smaller without losing much of its original quality.\nDue to the undesirable efficiency of the Neural Network Framework, we came up with several ways to increase our efficiency use multi-parallel subprocess to transform the image simultaneously, and use the resources of the server to its maximum. Because we depend on GPU rather than CPU to have a better performance, we chose the AWS instance that has more GPUs. Because the feature of the Open Source Torch Framework is based on Lua, we manipulate the iteration time on each image to achieve an effect of transition, giving user a feeling of more dynamic stylized images.</p>\n<p>Output Gif:\nWe store the image to an array and restructure them to form a gif, which is finally presented to the user.</p>\n<p><strong>Front-end:</strong>\nWe designed a user-friendly Web App using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery to orient the users to upload their videos, choose a style that they prefer and follow the page to finally get the stylized gif. On our home page, we designed as few icons and concise instructions as possible to make it clear to the new users on how to use the app. After uploading a video, the user can choose within a scroll bar several different styles of artworks to merge the video with. Then our app throws the job to the server to complete stylization process. When it\u2019s done, the user is directed to another page where he/she can view the resulting gif and share it to Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus etc.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>When we set up the service in the beginning, we need to install a bunch of libraries. The fatal thing is that these libraries have version conflicts, which took us a long time and drained our energy. At first we decide to se TensorFlow, an Open Source Software Library for Machine Intelligence, but the time this library take to process video is too long. Thus, we have to change our Framework to Torch. We worked with several programming languages (Lua) and Framework (Torch) that we\u2019ve never encountered before, so we had a high learning curve.\nThe stylized image was rotated after the transformation, and we need to align it to normal.\nThe biggest challenge is: it got super hard to code on 6am!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We achieve the functionality of not only stylizing the static image, but also for video. \nWe see our web app works pretty well. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Sleeping is reeeeeeeaaaaaaally important.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Re:Art</h2>\n<p>Migrate the app to multi platforms.\nImmersed in the conversation with our comprehensive services.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/lua\">lua</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">torch</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ubuntu\">ubuntu</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://reart.xyz\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://reart.xyz\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>reart.xyz</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the application pipeline design, stress test, and still image stylized processing backend.

We also had/generated a list of frequently used whole words accompanied by letters that come at the start of words or sentences.</p>\n<p>2) Lower level encrypting:\nFor encryption we used PyCrypto to implement AES-128, ECB with block size 16 bytes.</p>\n<p>3) Numerical:\nWe changed the base of the ciphertext (by default to 10, but can be any other base upto 26). Made a new number system to represent digits with letters of the alphabet in way to match our letter data. So eventually a ciphertext would be changed into a decimal number whose digits are the most 10 used sentence-generating/word-creating letters of the alphabet. </p>\n<p>4) Text generation:\nWe used our Wikipedia date to train a hidden Markov model to generate texts. Specifically, such a text must have sentences whose starting letters are consecutively the letters of our base-changed ciphertext (derived in step (3)).</p>\n<p>These steps would be reversed for decoding/decryption.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>1) Data-wrangling. Converting a 15G text file to another and parse it to get sentences is not pretty.\n2) Some weird programming problems e.g. having a defective clipboard buffer on my system that changed \"some\" texts when I pasted them, buy read it fine when I put them in a text file and read the fild instead!\n3) In order to prevent from having the model to learn everything, every time it's executed, we needed to export the settings. The exporting functionality of the markov library we used was both slow, required too much memory and it didn't have the form we needed. So instead of using it, we wrote the dynamic object to a binary file on the hard drive and then just reread it whenever we needed it which turned out to be faster.\n4) We tried to do a recurrent neural net at first, but it was simply much slower than markov for it produce anything that's comparably more natural-looking.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>First time dealing with data wrangling, markov models and neural nets, messing around with memory in Python etc. </p>\n<h2>What's next for NLS</h2>\n<p>I'll publish it as open-source in the next couple of days. It has some bugs when one directly changes the threshold of allowable letters and their word production frequency that I should fix later. Encryption implementation is not ideal. It doesn't hurt for its interface to pretty, either!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pycrypto</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">markovify</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wiki2text</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sparkpost\">sparkpost</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aalireza/NLS\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/aalireza/NLS\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Scriply", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scriply \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/067/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scriply \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/056/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The app's homescreen displays a brief review of dispenses in the past week.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scriply \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/057/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>One user can support multiple profiles for others in their care.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scriply \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/055/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Users can intuitively add and manage dispenses for themselves and others.</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Scriply \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/242/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The dispenser releases medication combinations using rotating, single-serve disks.</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Keeping track of meds is hard. In the U.S., there is a markedly low adherence to refilling and taking prescriptions; in fact, nearly 50% of people taking a chronic medication stop taking it within the first year, with the biggest drop-off occurring in the first month. Additionally, prescription drugs are highly susceptible to abuse by non-prescribed users who have access to the medication, with 52 million people reporting that they have used prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons at least once in their lifetimes. Finally, many people manage prescriptions for others, namely elderly people and people with impaired memory. Ensuring that the other person has taken the correct dosage every day can be a major challenge.</p>\n<p>Scriply is combatting the biggest issues related to prescription drugs by allowing users full insight and control over their prescription regimens through an intuitive app and multi-user dispenser.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The Scriply app allows its user to set the weekly medication regimen for themselves and any other individuals in their care. Based on this information, the dispenser will combine and release the formulation of pills that individuals needs on demand. Data on dispenses is then sent to the app for the user to be able to monitor activity.</p>\n<p>The system is designed to make prescription management seamless and intuitive by integrating additional features such as optional reminders, notifications when prescriptions need to be refilled, and the ability to order prescription refills in-app.</p>\n<p>This competes with similar products on the market because current offerings require users to physically input every drug combination for every dispense, can't dispense liquid medication, don't allow for activity monitoring, only serve one individual per machine, don't allow for freedom in reminders, and, quite frankly, aren't very visually appealing. Scriply addresses all of these issues, and does so on a clean, user-friendly interface.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Understanding that managing prescriptions is nobody's favorite pastime, Scriply's system was designed to require as few interactions as possible while relaying an extremely high level of actionable information to the user. Accordingly, we designed our iOS app to be straightforward, bright, and intuitive. This app connects directly to the dispenser, and can prompt the dispenser to release any combination of pills on demand.</p>\n<p>The dispenser can release two types of medication: pills and liquid medicine. It functions by rotating juxtaposed disks that select and accept a single serving of meds and dispenses them down a shoot. The majority of its components were 3D printed using CAD. Our team built the underlying mechanics on Arduino and subsequently developed a platform to connect the Arduino system to a Node.js server.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest technical challenge that we faced was that the 3D printing process took longer than we had anticipated, which caused us to have to readjust our design schedule on multiple occasions. The team concluded that had the designs been more space-efficient, much printing time could have been saved.</p>\n<p>A second major challenge arose from developing the app's logic. Because prescription drug management conflates an array of different factors, our team put much more time than we had expected we would into theorizing on the different scenarios and possible troubleshooting issues that might arise for the user, and continuously found ourselves confronted with holes in the experience that needed to be patched up.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Overall, our team managed to create a viable proof of concept for a product that could facilitate the lives of many individuals who deal with difficulties related to prescription drugs. The system integrated both software and hardware to perform a task that is relatively nuanced for what can be built in 36 hours, and the team learned much in doing so.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The multi-faceted nature of this project allowed our team to gain exposure to a wide range of problem-solving opportunities. Firstly, this project was an exercise in teamwork wherein every member of our team was made to contribute their expertise to an overarching concept. This meant that we had to harmonize our skillsets and abilities, and determine how any lapses in knowledge would be addressed\u2013 sometimes this meant having to rapidly learn a new technical skill, and others it meant overcoming a fear of talking to strangers. Secondly, this project was this team's first full immersion into design thinking. We attempted to address every problem we encountered with a user-centric answer, employing our sense of empathy with the end user. Finally, we were able to garner a deeper sense of issues related to prescription medication use. These issues aren't very visible in society, but many individuals struggle with at least one of the problems that we identified, and we believe that were made much more cognizant for it.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Scriply</h2>\n<p>Due to the time constraint, the app and dispenser were built to the point of proof of concept, but not to their full functionality. As we Scriply moves forward, we are aiming to build out the app's back-end to meet its current front-end framework, incorporating a prescription database for users to have a menu of drugs to choose from and embedding the prescription refill feature, as well as refine the dispenser's physical design to be more aesthetically appealing to match the user experience on the app.</p>\n<p>Personally, we will continue to further our awareness into issues stemming from prescription medications and seek out innovative and integrated solutions.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cad</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["HackFinder", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackFinder \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/417/871/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>01_landingPage</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackFinder \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/417/872/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>02_chooseHackathon</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackFinder \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/417/869/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>03_meetBip</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackFinder \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/417/870/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>04_extraDetails</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackFinder \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/044/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>05_yourItinerary</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackFinder \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/404/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>06_sparkpostEmail</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"HackFinder \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/403/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>07_iconThumbnail</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We go to a lot of hackathons, typically we drive but on occasion we've flown.

There is no reason to constantly create new messaging apps and channels and such to communicate with people who are currently browsing the same page as you are (especially applies to hackathons)</p>\n<p>Take for example Discord. No one uses it, yet people have questions. Having one extension that allowed people to chat with anyone in the channel would be amazing, lightweight, and efficient.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built an extension for Chrome using Javascript. The chat is accomplished using the MQTT protocol which holds the backend of the service.

We used JS, HTML, and CSS to design the functionality and look of the UI of the popup and used the material design standard.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Setting up the MQTT server took a little bit of time, and neither of us are front-end developers, so playing around with the JS took some getting used to.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>CARM is fully functional on nearly every single website out there, and if we publish it to the Chrome Store, then ANYONE can start using it. It's the first app made at a hackathon that can be published nearly instantaneously after the end of the event for half our team.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We gained a critical understanding of how to setup and work with MQTT servers to handle the storage and push/pull of messages. We also got to work more on our front-end JS, HTML, and CSS skills which is a stark change from the Java/Android frameworks that we have more experience with.</p>\n<h2>What's next for CARM</h2>\n<p>We want to be able to send messages that include videos/audio. However this would require us to upgrade from the MQTT service that we are currently working with to something along the lines of Pub Nub, or more.

A Combination of Battleships, Star Trek, and that one Real-Time Strategy game you remember from middle school, A Space Game is the result of 36 hours of bugs, hacking, and lots of waving our hands in midair by 4 first time VR-hackers. </p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by how VR can transform traditional game and simulation experiences. The ability to move around the space and take different perspectives allows for a lot more information to be presented to the user, and a lot more immersive an experience. We decided to create a real-time strategy game to make use of these new opportunities. </p>\n<p>In the game, the player controls a set of Alliance ships, against an armada of enemy Vorg ships. The ships automatically fire within a certain distance of an enemy, and thus the player's job is to position the ships in order to maximize the damage they deal to the enemy. </p>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<p>A Space Game is built using Unity and the Vive VR system. </p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>We are all new to VR, only one of us had ever done game development, and only one of us had ever been to a hackathon before. Learning Unity, learning C#, and figuring out how the game engines work were a huge challenge for us. We also had a change of direction in the game. While we originally intended a much more subtle game, with a focus on radio pings to discover previously invisible ships, we found that the visual impact of a full-scale space battle was just too tempting. Perhaps because none of us had more than casual experience with VR, we were blown away by the capabilities of the technology and focused on an immersive, and impressive, visual experience. </p>\n<h2>The Results</h2>\n<p>What are we proud of? This is our first VR game! We're proud of how much we have learned, about VR, about Unity, and 3D games. We are also proud that we have what we consider to be a functional and very entertaining final product. In particular, we are very proud of having figured out the controls and the very visually informative waypoint guiding system for player controlled ships. </p>\n<p>We learned a lot of things about project management especially. As a designed-driven project, we often had disagreements about what direction the game should take, and often had trouble explaining our ideas to each other. If nothing else, we learned how to stay calm and trust each other in making big decisions, even if we don't always see the other person's vision. </p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Next for us is, hopefully, some VR equipment :) In all seriousness, having spent so much time with the Vive, we are convinced of the amazing capabilities of VR even beyond gaming. For this project, we hope to re-introduce some of the features we removed, and create a menu where the player can choose between the various ways of playing the game. Some more focus on balance and level design would also really enhance the experience. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vive</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jmjv4w28c1fbvaf/AAD9IuzOp4l9yJbR1mss7WA-a?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jmjv4w28c1fbvaf/AAD9IuzOp4l9yJbR1mss7WA-a?dl=0\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.dropbox.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["SpeakEz", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SpeakEz \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/111/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Public speaking is one of those anxieties that everyone has. It is difficult to overcome, mainly because people lack the opportunity to get in front of a group of people to practice speaking. This lack of practice exacerbates the fear, creating a positive feedback loop, making public speaking the worst phobia in North America. We built SpeakEz with the hopes of helping people make public speaking a normal thing. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>SpeakEz presents the user with the proper environment to practice public speaking. By utilizing a virtual reciprocating crowd, the user can prepare for any public speaking scenario. Users have the option of listening to their own voices (something many dread), as well as seeing their own hand movements. This allows the user to become comfortable with public speaking in private until he or she becomes a public-speaking pro!</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team utilizes Unity and the Oculus Rift API to provide the immersive environment for the user. To further provide a realistic feel, we attached the head-mounted display with a Leap Motion, allowing users to see their hands and the different gestures that people unconsciously make. Lastly, we used a 3D printer to create a compact kit that held the setup together. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our main challenge was figuring out different methods of measuring anxiety using the hardware and software we were provided with. Initially, we tried using a speech-to-text API to feed data into a tone analyzer, but after being unsuccessful in working with the APIs, we had to search for other queues that could be used to measure anxiety. Coordination was also a challenge, as using git would be near impossible with the sheer size of the files. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>This was the first time the team had worked with the Oculus Rift (or any VR dev kit for that matter). We also built an accurate model of the SDHacks event in the short period of time we were provided with. Lastly, we overcame software and hardware difficulties and were able to create our own algorithms for measuring how nervous users were.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to cope with the hardware issues that made development hard.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SpeakEz</h2>\n<p>The team plans to work on making the models more realistic, while nailing down the version control for when we all work on the project. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leap-motion\">leap-motion</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/3dprinting\">3dprinting</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cjsimon/SDHacks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/cjsimon/SDHacks\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Wrote and integrated raw sound recognition for analyzing voice modulation ", "Wrote the algorithms for measuring nervousness using the Oculus Rift and the Leap Motion Controller.

Essentially, fight against an opponent where you can parry or dodge to defend and swipe at the opponent to attack. When the opponent hits you in, for example on your left side, you feel a vibration there.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Ideally we would have liked to use tiny vibration motors placed all over a jacket to provide precise and powerful vibrations all over, but we only had access to stepper motors. So we wrote random values to the stepper pins to make it behave like a vibration motor - as hacky a solution as we could come up with!\nWe then used unity to build basic spherical \"boxing gloves\" that simulated the opponent and slowly built the design up from there - eventually creating a Julius Caesar sword-fighting game in the middle of a forest!</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Setup. Unity was a rather large hurdle to overcome as a framework, especially the design. Also, audio sources were difficult to deal with, as it seemed to have been decreasing our runtime and affecting the gameplay. We also had a pre-existing model of a boxer that would've been really cool to use, but animations were very difficult to handle with that model. Getting the steppers to behave as vibration motors was also tricky.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Getting all of it to work!

Our primary focus was on education. \nSecondly, this is our team's first hackathon, so we were aware of our limitations and inexperience and factored that into the concept of creating a finished product. A finished product was essential to us. We budgeted our time and we made the edits that we had to. All this so that we would be able to say at the end of SD Hacks, this is what we made. While we still have visions for what we would add or what Risa's Garden can become, we were aware of how important it is to be able to show people a finished product.\nThird, we were influenced by how we come from different backgrounds beyond computer science, such as art and music, and decided we wanted to make a game or some sort of interactive story. We were inspired by the direction western indie games have taken, with emphasis on storytelling and atmosphere.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Risa's Garden is an interactive storybook! As Risa puts love and care into her garden, so can you!</p>\n<p>Risa's Garden is a story for kids with consciously constructed themes of investment, diligence, and friendship. The premise for Risa's Garden is the idea that if you take care of a garden, there will be flowers. But if you don't, then there will be weeds. Roy took this idea from his past teacher to create a story that explores this theme in more depth and synergizes this with the visual and sound components of the story.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Adobe Flash to create the program with Actionscript 3. The art was created with a combination of PaintTool SAI and Photoshop.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Sound effects. Thanks to Eddy we had a library of different sounds we planned from the start on using to give a better, more dimensional game feel. We understood that sound effects give a sensory feedback that is essential when making an interactive experience. Unfortunately, we had difficulties implementing them into the program and if we had more time we would absolutely integrate sound effects for the actions.\nWe had many sound problems during the creation process, so we made the executive decision to invest in the polish of existing sound elements of narration and music.\nHonestly, all in all, any challenges we ran into, any bugs we faced, we managed to solve together. Any human problems, such as creative fatigue, was solved by looking after each other (even if sometimes people wouldn't listen at first).</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are so proud of the fact that for our first hackathon we have made a completed project that we can show people. It is also accessible to the general public; if anyone asks us what we made at SD Hacks, we can tell them we made an interactive children's book. It's not abstract, it's tangible. Everyone will be able to understand what that means.</p>\n<p>We are also very proud of everyone on our team. We could not have not made Risa's Garden without every member of the team. Everyone contributed something unique. When you work with friends who value teamwork, every step of the process is fun, even when you're dying. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the basics of Actionscript 3 when used for Flash. \nThe most we learned about was the development process. We haven't yet gotten the development experience from beginning to end in class. \nWe exercised budgeting skills by asking ourselves how much can we do in this time? What do we want to be done by this time? Do we have to cut this element? \nWe exercised what it means to work in a team and understood what it meant for each member to be a functioning unit in order to make the most progress.\nMost of all, we learned how satisfying it is to have a completed project you made with your friends.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Risa's Garden</h2>\n<p>Our original dream for Risa's Garden was to make an educational experience for children. It was originally intended to be a typing game, but then in the interest of a finished product we budgeted our time and made cuts for our timeline. We wanted to unite this actual somatic education with the moral education of themes that you can see now in the story. For our team in the future, we absolutely intend on making more developed stories, experiences, and products.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-flash\">adobe-flash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/actionscript\">actionscript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Phouse", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hvhr26a_fo?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Phouse \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/417/972/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Phouse \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/417/974/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>3Dconnexion SpaceMouse Pro Wireless - 3D mouse, but who wants to pay 300 dollars for such a mouse? Phouse (Phone mouse) is a lightweight alternative that gives users a unique mousing experience for free.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The phouse connects to a computer over Wi-Fi as a mouse. What separates this from many of the other Android mouses currently out there is the usage of the accelerometer integrated into Android devices as a form of mouse movement. This offers advantages over normal mouses and track pads by allowing for intuitive movement, not requiring a cable or adapter, and not requiring table space. It also provides clicking functionality and has potential to include keyboard inputs in the future. This hack also includes a 3D printed mount for the phone to give the user the same usability as expensive options such as the SpaceMouse.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Programmed in Android Studio, Eclipse, and a smartphone. \nMount modeled in Autodesk Inventor Pro, 3D printed on a Fusion 3 using the Simplify3D slicer</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Setting up the sockets/server/client caused a couple issues, especially since I ended up making it mostly a one-way connection. Furthermore, the use of a 3D printer made it difficult to allow the mount's ball joint to have free, accurate movement.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It's a pretty cool idea and really the first time I have used Android applications for anything beyond a really basic app.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>For me, it was an exploration into the realm of User Experience and Human-Computer Interaction. I definitely had a lot of fun implementing it and picked up some practical Android/Java knowledge at the same time.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Phouse</h2>\n<p>Phouse could benefit from more features such as keyboard macros/mappings and additional screens.

If you happen to step out of class and you have about an hour to kill, through Trivents, you can instantly figure out what events are going at that time or even later that day. </p>\n<h2>What is Trivents</h2>\n<p>Simply put, Trivents makes events easier to manage and register for. By creating an event on Trivents, you have the option of automatically making an event on Eventbrite, Google+, MeetUp etc. based on the information you submitted on Trivents. We can even retrieve information from a Facebook event (with just the URL) and post to all other social medias. We are, therefore, it a one-stop event creator with free social marketing.</p>\n<p>The other reason that makes Trivents special is it's QR code system &amp; hassle-free registration.\nEvery event has it's unique generated QR code that whoever wishes to go for, can just scan it and send it to our messenger bot. The messenger bot confirms the event and in-turn takes in information such as your name and email (automatically) and specific details such as food preferences (which vary by each event). Typically this information is required at the time of registration/check-in at the event. Taking in this information, messenger replies back with a personalised QR code which can then be scanned at the event check-in (and retrieve details you put in the bot). This optimises the efficiency of event sign in and substantially reduces queue waiting times. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built out our web app using the Meteor.js framework and maintained a MongoDB backend for both the app and the Facebook messenger Bot. We used the Facebook Graph API extensively along with the Eventbrite Post API and Google's Map and QR Code, Location and Places APIs. The Facebook Messenger Bot is hosted on a Heroku server, where the Facebook Messenger API communicates with the bot via a web hook. It takes in many forms of inputs, including text, pictures, and button pushes. It generate out QR Codes from the Google QR Code API, and reads QR Codes from the Zebra Crossing API. It also utilizes the DocuSign API to accept a user's signature for event waivers. </p>\n<h2>Challenges and what we learnt</h2>\n<p>There were various technical challenges throughout the development project. Whether it be debugging, new modules, Google maps API and especially internal server errors, but slowly and steadily we overcame all of them, and this is something we're extremely proud of as a team. </p>\n<p>Throughout this project, all of us have learned significantly. All four of us were pushed outside our comfort zone to learn a new programming language, platform or an API. Alongside technical skills, we also learnt how to effectively collaborate as a team, ask for help and get things done.   </p>\n<h2>Trivents' future</h2>\n<p>Trivents is currently focused on UC San Diego and San Diego events, but eventually we would want to expand to other colleges, cities and countries. Furthermore, we intend to add a \"roaming mode\" through a mobile app wherein if you are within one kilometre radius of an event you get push notifications. At the moment, we're using Facebook's Messenger API for scanning QR codes and registering for events. However, in the future we want to be a completely stand-alone mobile and web application with our own QR scanning logic. Also, we want to become smarter (possibly by using machine learning methods) by understanding the user's preferences and in-turn display those events that match with the user's liking more <strong>prominently.</strong> </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-javascript-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">facebook-messenger-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">google-qr-code-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">zebra-crossing-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">docusign-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-graph\">facebook-graph</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Worked almost entirely on front-end of the application.

Upon request, it posts the most popular emote of a certain time interval, which allows users to reflect upon the chat's hivemind and contribute their own 28-pixel creative expression. Chat activity and sentiment is used to adjust the bot's actions within the chat.</p>\n<p>Entertaining Users</p>\n<p>The bot uses Reddit to crowdsource artificially intelligent conversations. For example, it tells mystifying riddles that the community finds the most bemusing, breaking news that the community finds the most relevant, and hilarious jokes that the community finds the most humorous. These are the most agreed-with and conversation-provoking posts on Reddit, and we believe that Twitch may find these posts just as intriguing.</p>\n<h2>Promoting Activity</h2>\n<p>The bot promotes activity within the chat by raising challenges and contests on regular intervals. The bot currently has functionality to ask riddles and host typing contests. Riddles from the most thought-provoking posts from Reddit are asked, and the bot notifies users if they have correctly answered the riddle. It also hosts a typing contest, where one sentence is posted and the first user to correctly copy the sentence into the chat is congratulated and ranked in a leaderboard.</p>\n<h2>Using the Bot</h2>\n<p>The user types !menu to see a privately-messaged list of available commands.</p>\n<p>!typerace creates a typeracing mini-game and posts the winner on a leaderboard.</p>\n<p>!leaderboard shows the leaderboard from !typerace.</p>\n<p>!jokes activates the bot to tell a top joke from Reddit every few minutes.</p>\n<p>!riddle asks a top riddle from Reddit and checks the chat for an answer.</p>\n<p>!news posts breaking news from Reddit.</p>\n<p>!emotepulse shows the hottest emote in a chat every few minutes with the amount of occurrences.</p>\n<p>quit (cancels riddle or typerace when one is underway)</p>\n<p>joke (sends a random joke to the chat, can only be used once !jokes has been called)</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<p>Jokes and riddles are filtered for offensive content that does not abide by Twitch's Rules of Conduct.</p>\n<p>News posts, however, are intentionally sourced from uncensored Reddit posts to promote freedom of information.</p>\n<p>Typerace phrases are useful tips scraped from Reddit's YouShouldKnow subreddit, which allows users to learn as they type.

I'm quite familiar with Twitch, so I thought it would be fun to make my own bot. In addition, I enjoy working with APIs, and all the data they offer.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>When the bot.py file is run, the client (on this computer) connects to Twitch's server. Three messages are sent from the client to the server, in order to log in to Twitch with the bot account and join a specific streamer's chat room. The bot then finds out what game the streamer is streaming, using the Twitch API, and passes the game's name to the Deviant Art API. Using the DA API, I searched for works relating to the game, and took the top 250 most popular (as defined by Deviant Art) URLs. From there, I generated a random integer between 0 and the length of the list containing all the URLs, and used that integer to decide which link the bot would post. The bot posts the specified link, and repeats this process every 5 minutes.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I read a lot of documentation and watched a few YouTube videos in order to get started. From there, I used what I learned in my classes and applied it to this bot. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I struggled for a long time trying to read the documentation for the Twitch API, and setting it up in Python. My program wouldn't let me log into Twitch, and I kept trying to figure out why for a few hours; it wasn't until I asked my friend who was also developing a bot that I figured it out.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned to utilize resources found on the Internet, and how to create a simple bot.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Twitch Chatbot</h2>\n<p>I actually am not entirely sure how my bot works, so I'll probably try to figure that out first. I also need to clean up my code.

Lol. The thing is I luckily got a Oculus Rift, because I never have enough money to own any VR equipment, when first time to Hackathon, I found it offers Oculus Rift and HTC VIVE! I was so excited and request one immediately and I got it!</p>\n<p>Second, the space of urban office is going so so expensive. People have to share their office, and there is no privacy somehow even. Moreover, even you could get fit on that, you won't have a lot freedom on office, you have to follow some certain rules. So I was thinking that how about to build a world which has unlimited possibility to modify it by your own, and it could get rid of all those restriction. </p>\n<p>Third, playing gaming is always bad idea when you share you room with other. You won't get any piece if your roommates don't have a similar schedule, and small space has, again, same problem as above. Even you have your own house, you have to care about sorting different stuff. You won't be enjoy a lot because you have to consider aftermath. If you lost something, you have to spend a lot time on that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>By creating a whole space area in virtual world, your own idea is restricted in that tragic small screen no more. You could also get rid of the interference from outside world, it also get rid of the interference from outside world. \nI basically create a virtual space for different modifying. People could wear a VR equipment and get into the space which allows to modify whatever they want. I would rather say it is a platform rather than some kinda individual software. Due to lack of development ability and experience, I offer just some basic tools which allow people stream their actual stuff from real world like the desktop and setting interface, which allows people to using keyboard in virtual world. I am also leaves some space to improve including different kinds of widgets, and also easy-use development environment.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I use basically Unity3D and C# to build this VR apps. I would says it's just a light app because it is still not completed individual software. I was able to build it by searching tons of pages. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>That's my very first time I've been Hackathon and I should say it brings a lot of burden on me. Moreover, I am a international student who even does not speak English well. This is my first year to ucsd, so I actually expect nothing when I come here. But unexpectedly, I got my dream equipment via MLH, and I decide not waste it. The first day and a half, I was almost submerged by tons of different programs. I have to figure out installing all those things, and finding all those drivers and programs were super complicated for me cuz language (sigh). and I made it work, and I also make the framework of the apps</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I was knowing so little about the computer science. I am totally fool about C# and Unity and not matter what programming language. But I was doing so far as I doing my best. I complete the interaction between the computer streaming and the app itself which there is so less information about that in Internet. And I also complete the interaction via Leap Motion using hand gesture. I was able to use my hand to play inside of my apps. a Lot of Fun!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a looootttt. I would say it was the best experience I ever had. I makes a couple of friends and they gave me a lot of courage. Although I just sleep one or two hours in this 3 days, I can't stop my progress because I was so excited that I could do so far at the situation I know little about the computer science.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WorkField - You own unlimited space</h2>\n<p>I would like to add some widgets like browser, album, real-time changing environment, clock, office text tools, or even virtual Multi-person video chat room. It could also comes with two camera which allow to scan the nearby environment to create a connection and model between virtual and real world.</p>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Dog or Nah?!?!", "<div

The idea is that it would be set up on a tablet or PC at places such as library check-out desks, event registration tables, etc. to allow people to easily and quickly register their number to get reminders for a specific event. It's oriented towards short-term services, rather than, for instance, having to download an app and register every event you attend on it.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Angular2, through the angular-cli tool, to develop our front-end. Materialize CSS was used for design, and we used the Twilio API for sending text messages to users.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>FRIKIN PORT 80 ON OUR AWS SERVER STILL WON'T OPEN #TRIGGERED\nEDIT: @9:55AM still won't open, I cry.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We got angular-cli to work, after many struggles. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We need more time. Plz. Debugging is the devil. Also angular-cli is 2 new 4 us, needs more documentation (and StackOverflow).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tick Tock</h2>\n<p>Currently, our reminder system gives a preset reminder a preset time after the user enters their number. Next steps would be allowing users to quickly and easily set up a custom message and time to remind/time delay from entry, then load our current number entry page to use their specific settings for that session.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angular2</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kevinchow7/sdhacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kevinchow7/sdhacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Tesseract", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tesseract \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/420/562/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tesseract \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/420/561/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Tesseract \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/156/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our inspiration comes way back from when we created the prototype for the Tesseract.

It has usefull and creative purposes in the areas of art, engineering, and the Internet of Things. For artistic purposes, the Tesseract has the capability of using 3D to 2D graphical projection to display 3D objects on a 2D plane. The Tesseract is good for engineering purposes when it comes to using the Tesseract as a method of displaying the status of systems or as a XY plane for plotting data. Lastly for the Internet of Things, the Tesseract is capable of displaying the weather, news, musics, and other aspects on each of the six displays.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The Tesseract consists of the frame, RGB Matrix displays, Arduino, and any wiring needed to connect it all together. We designed the frame of the Tesseract using SolidWorks and used the 3D printers at SD Hacks to print the frame. The RGB Matrix displays are all connected in series and the DATA IN pin is connected to the Arduino for the data signal. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we ran into was having enough memory in the arduino to support all of the functionalities that we wanted. Originally our plan was to connect an accelerometer/gyroscope to the arduino also, but we weren't able to because the code for the sensors and the RGB matrix was too large.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We proud of having been able to fabricate the entire cube in a weekend. </p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>We increased our skills in coding, Solid modeling, and prototyping.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Tesseract</h2>\n<p>To implement more the features internally into the cube.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rgb-matrix</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">solidworks</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printer</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ws2812</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on a robot arm(software) that could be used with the cube(the main thing).I also provided parts for the cube and helped out with other things.", "I worked on building the robotic arm that could be used for human interaction with the LED cube.

However, it is always the case that the difficult programming language grammar daunts the beginners to explore them further. It is not easy to write or understand very complicated codes. So, we built a game that eases the complex grammar but keeps the logics. The player can  feel the magic of programming through building the world.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our character, Rick, is controlled by commands written by the player, with pretty much the same syntax as C/C++/Java. With the initial curiosity, the player can joyfully type in commands as they familiar themselves with the programming syntax. \nFor instance, </p>\n<pre class=\"language-java\"><code>Rick.move(40)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command moves Rick forward by 40 pixels on screen.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-java\"><code>world.add(apple, 300, 200)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This command creates an apple in the game at point (300, 200).</p>\n<p>In the future, we will add more interactive elements to the game. Therefore, the player can freely make their own world through codes, and, at the same time, learn programming and have fun. Be creative ; )</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first split the task into several pieces, e.g. graphics game panel, text input interface, control panel, and syntax analysis. Each team member contributed to a part which he is best at. During the development process, the group was in active communication regarding interface compatibility and changes of design to face previously not considered incidences. Group members were also actively helping each other to solve bugs. After a part is finished, codes is assembled, compiled and tested to make sure they worked as intended. Then the whole project is compiled, debugged and tested.</p>\n<p>Since we are using Java, we used three JFrames in coordinate with each other, one for control panel, one for text input and the other one for game interface. A center controlling class GameController is used to control the game. In the main method, text input frame and control panel are set up and linked to GameController, whose responsible for setting up the GameFrame. Then GameController.startGame() method is invoked, causing a new World object to be built from WorldFactory class with level 1 and assigned to a GameView. GameView reads in the assigned World object for its dimensions, paintable objects and paint respective objects on the Screen. World object embodies an ArrayList of PaintableObjects(namely PaintObject class), which GUI GameView gets and paints them one by one, are assembled in the WorldFactory, Each PaintObject has these properties, x, y, width, height, orientation, and tag. Every property assists the painting of objects. The routine is that, WorldFactory creates a World object, which contains all the information about the game, then the information is passed to GUI for display.</p>\n<p>The commands typed from the console are passed into the Game using a mechanism called Events and Actions. Every world or scene has events attached to them. Each event has a category and a name. When user types in a command, syntax analysis will work to figure out the category (in Java, the receiver), the name(in Java, the method name/field name) along with the arguments. Then, the world will match the category and the name against the all the events it is aware of ( from the scene event table or global events table). If a match is found, the associated action of the event will be executed, with the parameters read from the console. Actions are responsible for altering the world in certain ways as described by the command, e.g. reset the character's position, add things to the paintable objects array. In this way, the player can create the world using a wide variety of available commands and takes advantage of the flexibility of programming languages.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge for us is that we did not come up with an idea of what we were going to hack at the beginning. We spent a huge amount of time brainstorming and researching ideas, but each time when we thought something great, we found the exact same idea had already been taken by someone else. It frustrated us a lot. We strongly believe a great and unique idea is essentially important for us to create something entertaining and inspiring. \u00a0\nThe next challenge is the collaboration. All of us are freshman and new to the programming. None of us had an idea of how we are going to finish the work together. In this process of exploring, we learned new things, made many mistakes and know more about each other. This is the most valuable price we earned in this hackathon.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>At the moment when we integrate our codes together and press the start button, and \u201cboom!\u201d everything was running fine, just as we expected, we were so excited about our accomplishment. \u00a0This is the first time for all of us to work together by designing the frame of the code and splitting the jobs evenly by ourselves! We wrote different parts of the code, and it just worked, like a magic to all of us. Probably as we are all beginners to the programming, we did not understand how hard our goal is. Eventually we realized that what we had accomplished is a new language and an interpreter! This sounds incredible to all of us and none of us believe that we could have done this without cooperating with each other.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>As this is our first time to be here at hackathon as freshmen, we learned that what is it like to work in a team in software development. In our high school, we often completes the projects on our own without help from others or any kind of collaboration. In hackathon, however, we worked the first twenty hours to come up with a great idea, then we worked as a team instead of as individuals. We need to help others along the way in order to accomplish our common goal. The joy we get, after the project finally completes, however, was also four times the individual fulfillment.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Rick's Adventure</h2>\n<p>After a few introductory levels, Rick's World will eventually be a commpletely free game. What we want to accomplish is that the program can give players with no previous programming knowledge a hand-on experience to learn about the basic logic of programing, but not the exact grammar, because the idea is more important; and the real game begins when they finish the adventure and enters Rick's World. The world is a blank sheet and the only object that pre-exists in the world is Rick. We design the controll panel allowing the player to create new methods or even classes into the program itself, thus, adding new objects, events or actions to the game. Also, we want multiple players to be able to edit the same world together, each one of them contributing their power. We believe that the creative community would be able to show the magic that beyond our imagination.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SDHacks2016/SDHack\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SDHacks2016/SDHack\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["ViDraw", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ViDraw \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/283/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Tracking football player locations</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ViDraw \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/284/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Finding features of a water bottle</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h1>ViDraw</h1>\n<p>Track moving objects in your video and display the path they follow.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/brandonxxlee/FootballPath\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/brandonxxlee/FootballPath\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["VR PC Builder", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyone on our team has built our own PC's, and find it valuable to teach others about the basics of the assembly of a PC.

Some of the other commands such as !nerdyPickupLine and !pokemonPickupLine pull from a predetermined list of pickup lines.

Basically whenever a user use this 3D Shopping app, they get a detailed info about the product along with the 3D model which help them to visualize it in a better way. We are also gathering personal information about the users (optional) to personalize their search and reduce the wastage of time. Besides, we could also extend it to suggest products that have been bought in their social network which none of the current systems provide.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Unity to build the augmented reality 3D shopping app. We implement the Vuforia library to detect the images and used freely available 3D models to meet our requirements. We used Facebook login as a way to authenticate and find more people in their network who are interested in a product. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating Android-studio code and Unity code was challenging.

Think of Amazon: a broad selection of all the items you could possibly imagine, except everything is for rent. This way, we can reduce on unecessary clutter around our houses (by not buying a new item you might only use once) while also allowing the renting owner to make some quick cash for items they maybe haven't needed in a few years. The driving force behind Renty was to solve a consumerism problem for people. Personally, I know that I have often bought an item I thought I needed, only to never use it again after its first initial use. </p>\n<p>What I did this hackathon: This hackathon, I wanted to get the bare bones idea and bare bones UI down for my project. Working alone, the pace was considerably slow. </p>\n<p>What I want to do with this in the future/post-SDHacks: The next challenge for me is to build the backend of everything. Make it so 'Login' actually logs someone in. Make it so 'Post' will actually register an item in the database,e tc. I don't have any (very little) experience with back-end, so I am excited to work on that. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ejlin/Renty\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ejlin/Renty\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on everything yay"]], ["Chatter", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>We were new hackers looking to create something.

When an element is clicked, for example the price of an item on Amazon, the chrome extension popup will fill up the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The value of the selected element.</li>\n<li>The parsed \"numerical\" value of the element.</li>\n<li>The URL of the webpage.</li>\n<li>The 'id' of the element.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The user can then enter their email (required for email notification) and an upper bound value to compare the selected value with and determine if an email notification is required.</p>\n<p>The last step is to click the \"Notify Me!\" button which will send all of the relevant info our server which will continue scraping the provided site and element and will email the user of the change in value when detected.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The chrome extension itself uses Javascript, HTML and CSS</p>\n<p>Our backend server runs node.js, MongoDB, and sends emails to users using SparkPost</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Each time the Chrome extension popup closed, the popup page is reset, and therefore would not retain any of the selected values. So we used a Background page to store the HTML data on the popup and restore it when the user reopens the popup.</p>\n<p>Often times a user may select an element on the page that does not have an 'id' attribute. This made our job of relocating the element during scraping very difficult. We were getting started on generating an XPATH to the element and decoding the XPATH to lead us to the desired element rather than 'id'. However we did not have enough time to completely implement it.</p>\n<p>In the backend, we had trouble connecting the front end Google Chrome extension with our node server. This made us explore several options. In the end, we decided to use Ajax to post the data to the web server. We had trouble getting the data we need in our web scraper because not every website has 'id'. We attempted to resolve this issue by retrieving the XPATH of the element, and retracing it on the server end, but could not get it to work for complicated sites like Amazon and Ebay. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>As many of us do not have much experience with the technologies (javascript, chrome extensions, node.js, SparkPost API integration)\nWe were proud to have created an application that could possibly redefine the way automated webscrapers work. </p>\n<p>A user can now interactively select any web element and decide the criteria for Promptify to prompt them with an email.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about collaboration during the course of this project. It is so important to keep your teammates up to date on both present and completed tasks. <em>One person can't do everything.</em></p>\n<p>Perseverance is critical. When we set our minds to learn all of the technology involved, we made our idea a reality.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Promptify</h2>\n<p>As of right now, Promptify is more of a proof of concept. However, we plan on making selection of elements fully dynamic by locating elements by way of XPATH instead of 'id'.</p>\n<p>We also want to inject the emails with CSS to make them look nicer.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we want to support more criteria for email notification. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Promptify me \"when the Operating Systems course offered at my school changes from MWF to TTH classes so that I can enroll!\"</li>\n<li>Promptify me \"When the GOOGL stock is between _______ and _______ \"</li>\n<li>Promptify me \"When ______ site goes live\"</li>\n<li>Promptify me \"When the Warriors v.

The Hack Harassment Challenge acknowledges that we can't guarantee eliminating online harassment, but we can work toward creating a safer online environment. For 36 hours, we aimed to create a software tool that would identify hate speech online and put a positive spin on it.</h1>\n<h1>We believe that to combat online harassment, we need to change how we approach hate speech. Thus, we took two approaches.</h1>\n<h1>One tool (found in homepage.html &amp; forms in Accordion.html) would identify and hide hate speech from users by collapsing the text. If the user decided to read the text, they can expand it, but the hate speech would be accompanied by a positive comment from us.</h1>\n<h1>The second tool (found in Hack_Hate_Extension) would allow users to actually hack harassment by using the inspect tool on Chrome. Users are reminded that what they see is just text and it can be changed. We encourage users to change the text to something silly or positive and share their changes to inspire others.</h1>\n<h1>Ideally, using hate detection software, we could stop harassment before it starts. But learning to handle harassment is an important life skill and our tools are designed to give people some reliable armor. However, both tools are incomplete for now.</h1>\n<h1>Dev Team</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Rosy Pendleton</li>\n<li>Magali Jimenez</li>\n<li>Phuong Tammy</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>10/02/2016</h1>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rosypen/SDHacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/rosypen/SDHacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["BugOut2", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BugOut2 \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/119/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>My Home Town!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"BugOut2 \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/120/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>An Amazing friend lives here!

Californians are the greatest. However in today's technological mecca, and time of great prosperity, Californians have somewhat taken the fact that we are super prone to natural disaster pretty light heartedly. Drills that we run in school are ineffective and I believe that it is necessary for everyone to have a plan if god forbid tragedy does strike.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Introducing Bug Out 2. We take Google's API and SDK and we help you make a plan for your loved ones by mapping out three rendezvous points and we will find you moments before an oncoming storm. We will prompt you to launch our app and based on your preset rendezvous points, we will use Google to route you to those three possible points and reunite you with your family. Our app will allow you to snap each route on your phone so that if the cellar towers we have grown so accustomed to go down, you won't be stranded. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Along with my partner I met here at SD Hacks, we felt the importance of this issue as a social/ public safety issue that goes unaddressed in an effective manner. We feel that since there is a smart phone in most Californian's pockets why not put their emergency preparedness close by so no one get's caught off. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>My partner did not know any Swift at all nor he own a Macbook. Swift 3 was upgraded and many of the frameworks both built in and open source were deprecated. It made it challenging on both of us at a complete disadvantage to partner up with each other. However, we felt that we stood to gain a lot more by working on this together. \nEg.1 We had to practice that awesome pair programming we do here at UCSD. We took turns programming and debugging. We helped each other out by looking up solutions and translations to Swift 3 from Swift 2.3 to Objective-C. Eg.2 We also learned new ways to parse JSON with the built in JSONSerialization in Swift. It was not without a challenge. Syntax had changed drastically with Swift 3 and the open source framework SwiftyJSON was not up to date and could not be used to parse our JSON code. So we utilized our tutors helps to understand how the JSON worked and we broke it down step by step and I feel better equipped to handle JSON now than ever. I'm sure my partner feels the same.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to parse JSON without SwiftyJSON. Something I had been really reliant on. I am happy that I ran into that challenge and I over came it. I am also proud of building an app that utilized the Google Maps SDK and Google Directions API something I thought was so crazy because I was accustomed to either working primarily with SDKs and hardware. I definetly had to push myself further and make myself uncomfortable to get to this point I feel now and that is boldly proud and happy I came out.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to not be reliant on source frameworks! To be quick on my feet! To work with your partner no matter how frustrating it gets and help each other learn above all. I really focused on integration with Web API and working with a new SDK which was also super nerve wracking at first but ultimately, something incredibly useful. </p>\n<h2>What's next for BugOut2</h2>\n<p>-Save options and the emergency provisions list.\n-Figure out why Firebase Auth failed and allow for group planning via WiFi\n-Get some travel time data from Google's API\n-Search for that perfect Natural Disaster alert API which we would use for push notifications. \n-We are considering Wunderground or GDACS.org</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dannypenguin/BugOut2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dannypenguin/BugOut2\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Implemented Google Maps usage, and managed most of the buttons including the keyboard interface.

Our excitement towards SD Hacks was heightened so much so that we watched tutorials the whole 6 hour drive.  One of our team members is the Vice President of the Game Development organization and is starting the initiative of bringing this kind of technology to Arizona State University.  We began to think of all the possibilities there are to utilizing the HTC Vive.  Then an even greater idea inspired moreso to win.  Imagine the possibilities and influence that bringing the ASU Game Development club an HTC Vive would have.  This would significantly help build the interest of ASU students in newer technologies and innovation.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Humble Abodes is a creative interior design application that enables you to fully decorate and customize your home to scale.  Users are able to try different furniture configurations without the heavy lifting, transportation, or worry of unfulfilled design aspirations.  Utilizing the HTC Vive, Humble Abodes gives users the freedom to create the home of their dreams.  Before beginning, there are a few control features we would like the user to be aware about.  In order to move around the house, simply click and point the track pad button in the location you would like to be.  Anything mounted on the walls with the exception of the refrigerator cannot be moved.  Point the track controller towards the item you wish to pick up, click the track control, and hold the side button simultaneously to carry and hold items.  In order to add items into the room, click the track controller and bottom button towards the picture of the item you wish to add.  Lastly, to delete items from your home, pick up the item and throw it over the side of the house without letting go of the track control.  We hope you have a wonderful experience.  VR pleased to serve you.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built our project using unity with C# scripts. None of the members in our group has ever had experience with virtual reality before, so we spent a good amount of time, at the beginning, playing with different Vive demos figuring out what we were capable of. We, then, found different templates on the asset store and started coding. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our two biggest challenges were that only one person could test (and to some extent code) at the same time and that we were all inexperienced with virtual reality. With the two of those combined, it was really difficult to distribute a lot of the coding workload between team members and when we tried to learn how to do new things, it took a lot of tweaking and testing for only one or two people.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are so proud that we can now say we have built an application for the HTC Vive. None of us had ever worked with virtual reality before, and it was an amazing experience learning and building the application. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned so much through this process. Half of our team had never used unity before, and half of our team had never used C# before. We learned so much about how to create a virtual reality application, how to test one, and that if you just can\u2019t figure something out, just take a walk around the room because usually everything seems to solve itself after a good break.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Humble Abode</h2>\n<p>With high hopes of winning the HTC Vive, we plan on sharing this technology with the Game Development club where students will be able to utilize and innovate creative, future applications.  By allowing other ASU students access, the HTC Vive will be put to greater use than just our team.  Our hope is that the ASU campus will be able to create a VR club similar to UCSD.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">htc-vive</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ani6gup/HumbleAbodes\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ani6gup/HumbleAbodes\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Crypto Games", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Crypto Games \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/090/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Crypto Games \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/419/091/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>In the modern world cyber security plays a huge role in our lives but is often neglected all the same.

We decided that there was a reason to improve and innovate in this area and </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We built a replacement for iClickers that expands and improves upon the idea.

Additionally, on the iOS side, we are very satisfied with the visual appeal and simplicity of the app. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned, on a technical level, how to work with mongoDB and Node and create a multiplatform API for database handling. On the mobile side, we learned how to properly post JSON via http requests written in Swift.  </p>\n<h2>What's next for Lecture.io</h2>\n<p>Take it to Android!

So I decided to build something not only makes it easier to find people who shared similar skills and technologies without realizing and find the less-popular repositories (which are relevant), but also something that can help developers to get accustomed to the idiomatic and best practices of development so that the general quality of repositories will increase. </p>\n<p>One of the obstacles to use open source projects for me is that there aren't always clear APIs or examples. To connect components of several different projects can be tricky, if you are not very familiar with all the idioms and best practices. I wanted to build a program that makes it easier to look up projects that import a certain set of other repositories, and people who are using a certain set of technologies. I also wanted to build a idea sophistication &amp; collaboration tool so that, once one get sa good idea of how people put different libraries together and who to collaborate with, one can go ahead and utilize the knowledge one just learned. </p>\n<p>Using this technology enables you to see repositories you would never have seen otherwise, and get to know people you would have had hard time finding.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>search open source GOLANG projects that import all of given repositories (must click the automatically generated suggestion)</li>\n<li>search open source GOLANG developers who have experience using all of given repositories (not necessarily in a single project, but throughout her open source career)</li>\n<li>Provide search functions through API (/search through GET, /intersectRepo and /intersectHuman through POST)</li>\n<li>Use the search query to build a collaboration space where you can design a project which utilizes as much open source projects as possible and no one has ever built.

The children of the village barely had enough to live on, let alone have instruments to play.

Upon seeing this, my first thought was to how they could create the larger instruments, xylophones and drums and the like.

Depending on the style and preference of the streamer, either they themselves or a moderator can decide what topics they would like to\nhave for the contestant if any. They will then set a length of time to allow chat time to create and begin the contest. Users will be able to upload their\nartwork on imgur. The bot will take all posted links in chat and store them in a secure hash table until the contest is over. Afterwards mods will be able to access\nthe list of users and their drawings and filter or remove any inappropriate or offensive content.

only allow players to walk around or teleport using the controllers. The goal of our game was to implement a virtual reality game which would require full body movement. The result was a very entertaining fitness/score chaser game which requires full participation and immersion from the player. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a fitness game where you dodge incoming blocks in a virtual reality space using an HTC Vive. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built this game using an HTC Vive and the Unity game engine. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge we ran into was depicting the blocks moving at the player in such a way that anyone could perceive its motion easily. Many early testers said that they thought the blocks were directly chasing them or that they couldn't tell how close the blocks were. As such we made it so the blocks changed from green to red as they came closer. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of creating a unique virtual reality experience which stands out greatly from other VR games due to its extensive movement controls.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use an HTC Vive in game development. We also sharpened our skills with co-routines in Unity. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Fit Head</h2>\n<p>More game modes, features, and a full release. We could also potentially theme our game into a specific training simulator such as for Navy aircraft carrier safety. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">htc-vive</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I designed the main aspects of the game as well as created the main scene of the game.

Mention Trump, Hillary, or Johnson and experience a mini easter egg. Access FB/Instagram/website links through the respective commands. Say hi or hello and you will get a happy response in return. Every 5 minutes, EduBot will let you know the most frequently used words and commands.</p>\n<h1>Polling</h1>\n<p>Want to start a poll to see what everyone thinks about a question? With EduBot, you surely can!</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Type: !poll [Question ending in '?'] [AnswerChoice1] [AnswerChoice2] [AnswerChoice3] [...]\n\n(Ex: !poll Who will win the presidential election? Trump Hillary Johnson)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Once a poll is up and open, users can type out their answer choice in the chat to cast their vote.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Type: !results\n</code></pre>\n<p>For the current results of the poll.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Type: !kill\n</code></pre>\n<p>To shut down polling for the current question.</p>\n<h1>Google Translate</h1>\n<p>Ever had a bot that could translate sentences for you? No? EduBot does it using Google's amazing API.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Type: !translate [fromLanguage] [toLanguage] [Sentence/word to translate]\n\nEx: !translate en fr I love Cats!\n</code></pre>\n<p>Languages are named by their \"codes\", some examples are en (English), es (Spanish), and fr (French). Please visit the link below for guidance.</p>\n<p>Link: <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-language-codes\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://sites.google.com/site/tomihasa/google-language-codes</a></p>\n<h1>Wolfram Alpha</h1>\n<p>Ever watch a stream, talk to your friends in chat, and do your homework? With EduBot, you can do all three in one Twitch window.\nWith the help of Wolfram Alpha's API, EduBot will help you solve your math problems, vocab questions, and physics exams with ease.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Type: !wolfram [problem you want help solving]\n\nEx: !wolfram derivative of (x^5)\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Social Media</h1>\n<p>Obtain more information about me by using the following commands:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>!facebook  =&gt; Gives a link to my Facebook\n!instagram =&gt; Gives a link to my Instagram\n!website   =&gt; Gives a link to my personal website\n</code></pre>\n<h1>Play TicTacToe</h1>\n<p>You probably knew of a bot before that let you play small games, but did it let you play a full game of 3x3 Tic Tac Toe? EduBot allows this!</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Type: !tictactoe\n</code></pre>\n<p>To begin a new tic tac toe game. For this type of game, any type of Char can be used, not just X and O but please keep it to only two; anyone can play who is in chat.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Type: !play [charToUse] [row] [col]\n\nEx: !play X 0 0 =&gt; Places an X at the top left hand corner of the board\n</code></pre>\n<p>To place your char at a specific row and column location. Both row and col is 0-indexed.</p>\n<p>The game will end when a player makes 3 in a row in any direction: horizontal, vertical, and both diagonals or if the game ends in a DRAW.</p>\n<h1>Announcements</h1>\n<p>Every 5 minutes (a minute count that is divisible by 5), EduBot will announce the top 3 most frequent words and commands used while being alive in the Twitch chat channel. This was going to be used for machine learning/AI algorithms to further interact with users, but it would've taken longer than the allotted time given for SD Hacks.</p>\n<h1>DocuSign</h1>\n<p>Doesn't have any functionality in this app as of right now but it is in the works. Wanted to use DocuSign for any formal agreements between Twitch chat users, most likely in the realm of tutoring services (given its name of EduBot), which I wanted to implement.</p>\n<h1>Easter Eggs</h1>\n<p>Mention Trump, Hillary, or Johnson and receive a popular quote that was said by them during this election season.</p>\n<p>Say hi or hello to EduBot and you'll receive a friendly \"Hey there!\" back. Nothing wrong with being nice. :)</p>\n<h1>Developers</h1>\n<p>Lucas Marzocco</p>\n<h1>APIs Used</h1>\n<p>Google Translate, Wolfram Alpha, Twitch Chat</p>\n<p>Last updated: 10/2/2016 3:38 AM</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lucasmarzocco/EduBot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/lucasmarzocco/EduBot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["It was a solo project.

We\u2019ve learned how to integrate team member\u2019s codes and unique skills together to make one cohesive project.  </p>\n<p>We plan to continue developing it, focusing on heightening the realism of the experience and offering different levels of intoxication in the simulation.</p>\n<p>Our simulation is a first step in the intermingling of VR and Data Visualization, having the experience give weight to the data and the data influencing the experience.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/nicholascrow/JEMNCDataVisualization\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/nicholascrow/JEMNCDataVisualization\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["HoloComm", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVJskx4fUmA?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As Generation 0 and Generation 1 immigrants ourselves, we all come from multilingual backgrounds.  English fluency is a critical skill for success and assimilation in our society, we wanted to use some of the most exciting trends in industry - AR and IoT - in this space for maximum impact.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>HoloComm is a real time translator.  Users enjoy the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual output (on Hololens) of surrounding English audio translated into user's preferred language</li>\n<li>Visual output (on Hololens) of English text in field of view translated into user's preferred language</li>\n<li>Object recognition and labeling in English</li>\n</ul>\n<p>HoloComm is also able to interact with our IoT avatar, Pikachu.  The object recognition feature recognizes Pikachu as the avatar and the the user is able to initiate conversation.  Pikachu, empowered by api.ai's natural language processing framework responds in conversational English.  The entire conversation is tracked by the user using the same visual output on the Hololens as before and is transcribed to the user's email using SparkPost.  Pikachu is meant to serve as an educational aide for users to practice their English at leisure.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Lots of love &lt;3 Many different technologies come into play here.  The majority of code is in C# to interface with the Hololens. connecting to hardware occurs over a Firebase database which triggers Python running on a Arduino.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Storing and processing snapshots of the visual field of Hololens to perform OCR and Object Recognition.  Currently, the images are being pushed up to imgur with Microsoft Cognitive Services analysis subsequently.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Building a complete user experience with rich interactivity.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How to build a user interface in Unity for the Hololens.  How to develop natively in C# for functionality usually accomplished in Node.js.</p>\n<h2>What's next for HoloComm</h2>\n<p>More features! An immediate addition is a gamified extension to object recognition which asks the user to identify certain objects with Pikachu as prompter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-hololens\">microsoft-hololens</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2\">c#</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-translate\">google-translate</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/api-ai\">api.ai</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/microsoft-project-oxford\">microsoft-project-oxford</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/imgur\">imgur</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tts</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dns</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sampurnabasu/HoloComm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/sampurnabasu/HoloComm\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on Google Translation API and Natural Language Processing API for our IoT device.", "", "", ""]], ["Channel Stats", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<div class=\"alert-box alert\">\n        This image is currently processing.
