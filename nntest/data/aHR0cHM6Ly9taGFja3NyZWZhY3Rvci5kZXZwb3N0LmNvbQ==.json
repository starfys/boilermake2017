What if we could make an impact on a group of people's lives? Manav had an idea to cater to Autistic people with emerging technologies via enhancing non-verbal communications. Two studies separately done by Stanford and MIT both state that children with autism have hard time recognizing face, whether it be guessing a friend's name, or deciphering facial expressions.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Uses Google Glass to scan human faces and to analyze the person's behavior. In real time, Google Glass processes and displays how much the user is getting attention and engagement. Meanwhile, a graph is offered in computer console to show consistency of attention or engagement. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Using Android Studio, we developed a Google Glass app with an android-based SDK called Affectiva. Affectiva is an emotion detecting application on Android. It pops up an emoticon that corresponds to one of the six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, surprised, sadness, attention, and engagement). For AutismAssist, we wanted to simply focus more on communications and functionality by displaying a percentage of how attentive and engaging a person is. </p>\n<p>Few stepping stones we took:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enabled built-in camera functions, to record a video while recognizing facial expressions in real time </li>\n<li>Designed a new package of emoticons for originality </li>\n<li>Programmed to display text and image icons during video/camera mode </li>\n<li>Created a visual display via Firebase on computer when AutismAssist is running simultaneously.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Learning how to code for Glass was a constant challenge since no one had an experience in developing for Glass. Also, Android Studio - Glass not offering app emulation slowed down checking whether our codes work or not. \nHere are more challenges we faced: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Slow start up time due to limited CPU power: OMAP 4430, dual core processor. </li>\n<li>Learning to control built-in features, such as camera feature </li>\n<li>Use of android app sdk into Glass sdk (face detection) </li>\n<li>Graphing - whether it is more effective to display on Google Glass or computer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Without a hesitation, we are most pleased to be part of helping Autistic people by creating an application with recent technology (&lt;2 years).

Click here</a></h2>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The idea for our hack came to us as we decided where we were going to set up for the weekend during the hackathon. As we searched crowded rooms across north campus, we knew there had to be a way to get real time updates about how many people are on campus and where they are studying. From this, FireNode was born. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>FireNode is a real time interior localization platform designed to provide high resolution population density maps of large network infrastructures.</strong> FireNode is a learning algorithm utilizing big data concepts - as more wifi hotspot data is collected, FireNode's knowledge of the network and hotspot locations expands to reflect more accurate user densities. Our service has three main components; data acquisition, analytics, and presentation. The data acquisition is carried out by a mobile app that reads GPS and wireless network information. This information is sent to a server where data analytics are performed using custom algorithms. Our algorithms determine the location of wifi hotspots through trilateration (similar to triangulation) and determine the number of people connected to a given hotspot. From there, the analytics data is sent to be presented to the user as a map overlaid with relative population density with a resolution down to individual rooms.    </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built a mobile Android app to continuously monitor network and GPS information in the background of the Android operating system. The app scans all available wireless hotspots every 5 seconds to retrieve access point IP addresses, MAC addresses and RSSI/frequency. The RSSI (signal strength) and frequency allows us to calculate  distance from the phone to a wireless hotspot. In addition, we monitor GPS location changes to pair network hotspots with a Latitude/Longitude coordinate. </p>\n<p>We use Firebase as our data management service, sending the real time data outlined above to the Linode Server. This Linode server hosts our java server, which analyzes and processes over a hundred wifi/gps combinations a second to identify the exact location of scanned wifi hotspots. <strong>We accomplish this by using a process called trilateration.</strong> Each non-linear trilateration calculation use all of the previous data points for a given hotspot, and custom calculations to compensate for the spherical coordinates of the earth. </p>\n<p>Finally, we have a node server running on our Linode host to gather IP connection information from the network. This node server contains an ARP table which allows us to look at all connected devices on the University campus and aggregate IP addresses. Once we have all available IP addresses, we can figure out how many connections each wireless hotspot has and link it to the location data collected before.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were a couple difficult algorithms that we had to write, involving some difficult mathematics to figure out.  Trilateration functionality on the java server was a difficult algorithm to implement. To get an accurate location out of the trilateration algorithm, we had to figure out how to convert latitude and longitude GPS coordinates to useable distances in a pseudo-cartesian coordinate system. For the mobile app, getting the distance between the user and the wifi router proved to be a challenge. We had to manually calculate the distance using the strength and frequency of the connected wifi signal. In terms of networking, matching BSSIDs to IP addresses in order to find unique connections over the entire network was a big task, given the massive size of the network. It required a lot parsing ARP information and finding suitable _ insights _  from that data.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our ability to overcome all of the challenges that we ran into while developing FireNode, ranging from the difficult mathematics of trilateration to parsing the massive amount of data about the network. We are also proud of the low latency time between collecting our data and displaying it to the user, i.e. making our application truly real-time.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Dominik learned Python.\nSean learned about the Android framework.\nMichael learned about networking via the Android OS.\nDominik taught Antonio that Python has a continue keyword...\nWe still haven't learned what the TBD prize was...?</p>\n<h2>What's next for FireNode</h2>\n<p>FireNode can now be expanded in countless ways. As our database grows, we can incorporate machine learning for predictive technologies. FireNode aggregates a lot of data about population density and traffic on a <strong>room by room resolution</strong>, which could be useful to both students and the school. Students who are looking for a place to study or an uncrowded room to work in would easily be able to see in real time which rooms would be the best to work at any given time. Schools on the other hand could use the data over a period of time to gauge and better understand what areas of buildings are used the most, have the highest traffic, and what areas of the building may need more Wifi access points. What is really exciting is that FireNode can be applied anywhere with a large network infrastructure, like corporate campuses, malls, or high traffic areas. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">indoor-localization</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">big-data</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">insights</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">travel</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wardriving</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">trilateration</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">a-winning-attitude</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wilddog</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://firenode.hmika.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://firenode.hmika.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>firenode.hmika.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mray19027/FireNode\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mray19027/FireNode\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Android Sensor Array\nAndroid Backend\nJava Server", "I worked on the Node.js server. networking logic, Python pcap dumper.", "", ""]], ["Guchi", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Guchi \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/351/452/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Web App</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Guchi \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/351/459/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>mobile version</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Guchi \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/351/478/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Twilio Rendition</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Mission</h2>\n<p>Yelp is great for restaurant discovery but there is disconnect once you\u2019re at the restaurant. We want to make information processing more efficient and ultimately refactor the way you make decisions when dining.</p>\n<h2>Problem</h2>\n<p>When you enter a new restaurant, how do you figure out what to eat? Sure you can pull out your phone and use Yelp to read all the reviews and look through all the unorganized pictures. After this, you\u2019ll be even more confused as to what to order and if you\u2019re already at the restaurant, you don\u2019t have time for this.</p>\n<h2>Solution</h2>\n<p>Guchi presents the 10 most trending dishes for your restaurant with organized images for each dish. Within seconds, you\u2019ll know exactly what to order.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Search for a restaurant and receive the top dishes from there.\nSearch by food and receive the best restaurants that offer your dish in your city.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our data is from Yelp, Open Table, Google Reviews and Zomato.</p>\n<p>Our algorithm is a network of two neural networks. The first uses natural processing techniques to extract all the food words in the reviews. This doesn\u2019t use a dictionary or lookup, but truly understands the concept of food. So we\u2019re able to capture things like misspelled foods, foreign dishes, and local vernacular. </p>\n<p>We also wanted to supplement each dish with pictures of that dish from that restaurant. A major issue is that most yelp photos do not have descriptions. So, we use another network for image classification. Since the dishes are very similar since they are from the same restaurant, we are easily able to identify what dish is on the picture.</p>\n<p>We use both these channels to deliver top 10 dishes with vibrant images for each dish from that restaurant.</p>\n<p>Our front end consists of a mobile (ionic framework 2, angular 2 beta) and web based rendition. Both platforms interact with a RESTful API which contains processed data from a recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Having to work on three parts of the platform (web, mobile, RESTful API from neural network) in parallel was extremely difficult but it was rewarding to see it all come together with relatively few issues, since we were in communication about integration of our individual components from the get go.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We created a platform that actually changes the way on how we decide what to eat at restaurants. We no longer rely on impulse or have to deal with unordered information from review services.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We all learned different things that were out of comfort zone. A few of the highlights include learning the new Angular 2, integration with Twilio and Firebase, and building a RESTful API from the results of a neural network.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Guchi</h2>\n<p>Integration with a major review service to allow them to continue interaction with the diners beyond just the restaurant discovery point. </p>\n<h2>Twilio and Firebase:</h2>\n<p>Even though we are accelerating the information processing stage by folds, we used Twilio to make it even faster. If you\u2019re really in a rush, all you need to do is text the restaurant name to our Twilio number and you\u2019ll receive a list of trending dishes to order. We have also added features to search by food and city as well to receive quick text updates with the appropriate information. We process all of this information using Firebase for lightning fast response and storage of users requests to better accommodate to their specific requests for subsequent searches.</p>\n<h2>Disney:</h2>\n<p>There are some mistakes in life we just can\u2019t afford to make and ordering the mediocre dish at a restaurant is one of them. For decades we have been going off of impulses or relying on dumps of information on restaurant review platforms to decide what to eat. But it\u2019s time to change the way we process information. For any restaurant, Guchi reads all the reviews and parses through all the images (including one\u2019s with no description) in order to give you the top 10 dishes with images from that restaurant for that dish. </p>\n<p>You\u2019ll know exactly what to order within seconds of using Guchi and you can spend the time on more important things. </p>\n<h2>Concur Travel Hack:</h2>\n<p>How many times have you have an amazing travel plan ruined by a bad dining experience. With Guchi, you\u2019ll be better than the natives when it comes to ordering the best dishes at the restaurants. If you\u2019re at the new restaurant, you can view the trending dishes with images. Or if you know what you\u2019re craving, you can search for the food and Guchi will tell you exactly where to go to get the best.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">javascript-es6</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">angular-2.0</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">theano</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">recurrent-neural-network</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">convolutional-neural-network</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing\">natural-language-processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">image-classification</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">embeddings</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tituswoo/guchi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/tituswoo/guchi\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Concept Oriented Deep Learning Algorithm Development and Deployment into restFUL API for web, mobile and twilio renditions.", "Built the android app, contrib to design of desktop app, and helped with architectural decisions.", ""]], ["Pear", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Pear \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/394/674/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Welcome to Pear</h2>\n<p>I published Vita (also known as Pear), an education-focused app to the App Store that enables kids to learn math because I believe apps are a great way to teach things.

We resolved this by using a stateful command processing library intended for Windows Powershell, which we've optimized for bash and sh on Linux and OS X servers.</p>\n<p>Security was also a major concern, because we needed to ensure both the user's shell sessions and command histories are safe and secure. Only a user's primary phone number may create, destroy, or edit shell sessions, but the user has the ability to invite other phone numbers to individual sessions for project collaboration and tech support. All sessions exist through temporary, randomly generated phone numbers, and all sessions self-destruct on a timer.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we discovered that mobile keyboards are not optimized for terminal syntax. Both Android and iOS keyboards have autocorrect and autofill features that conflict with typing commands, so we found it easier to write a special iOS keyboard.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Security is high priority and easy to ignore. Mobile autocorrect is frustrating. Randomly generating temporary phone numbers is expensive. Late night cookies are great.</p>\n<h2>What's next for SSH 4 SMS</h2>\n<p>Currently, SSH 4 SMS users must install a Node.js server with ngrok and relevant API credentials, but this process could be greatly streamlined by creating a central server that handles all API and database work. The keyboard portion of the project also has potential outside of SSH 4 SMS, as it works great with other command-processing apps as well.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk\">iphone-sdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mkausas/SMSTerminal\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mkausas/SMSTerminal\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mkausas/SMSTerminal-iOS-Keyboard\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mkausas/SMSTerminal-iOS-Keyboard\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["House of Carbs", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>People transitioning to college usually aren't used to cooking their own food and lack required skills in the kitchen to do so.

We felt that this lack of personalization takes away the sense of control that the client has over his or her investment.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WalletStreet is a web-app that analyzes the user's purchase history and spending patterns, and identify an industry that the user is most likely going to have expertise in. The app then recommends to the user top-performing stocks in that particular industry, ranked from most desirable to least desirable based on key metrics and performance data.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our app is hosted on Heroku and Firebase. The back-end is programmed in Python and can be roughly broken down into three parts: user-account generation using Capital One's API, algorithms that process the user-account info and detect spending patterns and market segmentation, and stock performance analysis using our own weighted ranking systems and BlackRock's API.</p>\n<p>We spent a good amount of hacking hours designing our supervised learning algorithms. After testing out multiple models including Naive Bayes Classification and ML relevance-scoring, we decided that it's best to use data normalization and vectorization as the main parts in our algorithm (along with other algos), since the accuracy of an unsupervised learning algorithm depends heavily on the number of iterations and training data sets. We generated over 17,000 entries as our training data set, which was ideal enough given our limited time and data availability but not ideal enough for unsupervised learning. Thus we used more supervised learning to guarantee precision and to have a better idea of how our algos work.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Wiring our app together, generating user data with Capital One's API, algorithm designing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the complexity of our data analysis and how much we learned over the past 36 hours. Our team was beyond excited to find our top recommended stocks closely match the market recommendations. Furthermore, we blind-tested a biased data set and the result industry actually matches the bias in the data. Financial advising is a billion-dollar industry with numerous experts doing it as their day-job and so is machine learning, both of which we accomplished (to a decent level) over a weekend.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to strategically analyze our data so that it works magic.</p>\n<h2>What's next for WalletStreet</h2>\n<p>The potential for this app is definitely beyond what we have accomplished over the past 36 hours.

This is a risk many take to enjoy to benefits such as cash back rewards and frequent flyer miles, at the risk of damaging their credit score.  Debit cardholders are at risk if their card is compromised and may stand to have their checking accounts emptied, with no protection or insurance to cover the loss.</p>\n<p>SmartCard MiddleWare (SCMW) takes the benefits from credit and debit cards and combines them with a simple service. No longer will a credit card holder accidentally spend more then they have or fail to pay their bill at the end of the month. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Users of SCMW will have their checking account balances checked before a credit card purchase is authorized. If the cost of the current charge is less than one's checking account balance the card will be authorized, the transaction completed, and the total cost of the purchase will be transferred out of one's checking to pay off the expense. Once this process is complete, the user will receive a text message with their updated balance.  If one does not have enough funds to cover the purchase, the card will be declined. The user will receive a text message letting them know the cost of the charge they attempted to complete and remind them of their current balance.  </p>\n<p>As a result of SCMW, users can reap the benefits of credit card rewards and build their credit score with no risk that is normally associated with having a credit card. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We leveraged Capital One's Nessie API to handle users, accounts, charges and more. Furthermore, we used Twillio's service to send the user informative text messages when they use their credit card. The logic behind determining pass/fail transactions were created using Javascript, and the site is built with a beautiful HTML5 and CSS3 template with custom graphics and diagrams.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We found that Nessie has a few issues of its own that we made aware to the dev team. Credit card transactions do not increment the balance of the card positively as making charges in the real world would, it only decrements balances. As a result, one must add a positive balance to the card when assigning it to a customer to make purchases. This is limiting, as credit card balances can't be added to manually once generated. To properly implement the logic behind SCMW we had to use a second checking account to act as a credit card until these issues are resolved.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We were proud to get Twilio integration working along with Nessie as it brings informative updates to the customer as they're using their credit card. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how easy it is to use a handful of the GET/POST/PULL/PUT API calls within Nessie for Accounts, Customers, Merchants, and Purchases. </p>\n<h2>What's next for SmartCard MiddleWare</h2>\n<p>We're hoping that a credit card company may release an API that gives a user more control over handling credit cards so SCMW could be implemented outside of a sandbox environment. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nessie</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://smartcard.rocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://smartcard.rocks/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>smartcard.rocks</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked with Nessie building the API calls and helped determine the logic behind SCMW.

Things including an 80 year old woman lying on her floor for more than 12 hours because she fell and broke her pelvis. But she couldn't call anyone because she couldn't reach the phone. Our new Amazon Echo/Alexa skill helps those who need advice on everyday medical help or emergency situations. We are making emergency medical care even more effective as well as everyday first aid. </p>\n<p>We were inspired by classic services such as life alert, which traditionally merged emergency services with technology to help save lives. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our new skill for Alexa can help guide you through simple first aid procedures such as a bloody nose or a sprain. The skill can also cross check your symptoms with symptoms of heart attack and flu. If Alexa determines that these lead to a dangerous situation, she can contact medical services for you. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Amazon Echo and the AI, Alexa. We followed through with Amazon and used AWS Lambda. We then combined the Twilio API as well as the Google Calendar API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The documentation for the Echo was slightly confusing at first. All team members are also new to AWS. It was also difficult to integrate APIs. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of just getting Alexa to work and respond to all our custom commands. We're also happy that we managed to split up tasks and work together on a project we were all passionate about.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We refined our Python and API integration skills. This was also a first hackathon for a few members, but also a first hardware hack for all members.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Baylexa</h2>\n<p>This skillset can be applied to bigger and important problems. We can scrape websites and help diagnose certain medical problems. We can also send data via an email and Alexa integration to the patient's physician. This new skillset can greatly improve the lives of the elderly who cannot get to a phone to call a loved one or their physician. This also has potential to change the lives of ordinary citizens who will now be able to receive first aid instructions without having to call 911 or their busy physician.</p>\n<p>We'd like Baylexa to support and maintain a database of emergency contacts, and store more information about common first aid fixes.

We wanted to build an application that extended far beyond any accessibility app we have ever undertaken. Keller is just that.</p>\n<p>With Keller, we\u2019re making learning Braille an immersive and intuitive experience for both the sighted and visually impaired. Typically, learning Braille can take months to years. Keller\u2019s unique built-in Braille Book and Braille Learning Modules captured through OCR technology and harness them into an engaging learning experience.</p>\n<p>The inspiration for our product\u2019s name comes from the most prominent blind women in history, Helen Keller. Much like how Helen Keller\u2019s miracle that story begins with her experiencing water and communicating with Anne Sullivan, we seek to build a platform that promotes learning language through immersion and engagement. Our logo represents the water pump so symbolic to the story of Helen Keller.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Keller is an Android app with a wide range of purposes, all aimed at helping both blind and sighted people learn Braille. One of the major features of Keller is the built in OCR camera, which enables students to digitally capture and have read aloud texts and signage they may come across during their everyday life. For the blind and visually impaired, this is a huge accessibility tool. But Keller takes it a step further: users have the option to convert that captured text to Braille and store in a personal database called the Braille Book. You can also make entries in your Braille Book with the simple speech-to-text service built in. Here, students can access stored Braille phrases and haptically engage with them through our state of the art Braille Learning Modules. Learning modules enable students to actually feel the Braille they have stored through the use of vibration. This helps build memorization and boosts engagement. Keller has an ingenious UX features, with every UI element having an auditory component, enabling the blind to navigate the user interface with ease.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Keller is an Android app, built using the OCR.space API along with several of Google\u2019s text to speech libraries in order to deliver the best possible learning experience for users. Data is all stored in FireBase, and requests to the APIs were completed using Volley. The Braille Learning Modules were created using Android\u2019s built in buttons and cursor sensing, for proximity detection.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge we really had was finding an optical character recognition API to convert our images to text that we could work with. After that, development stalled frequently around development of our Braille learning modules as they are contained in the BrailleBook, which had to be coded mostly from scratch. We argued about how best to create a sort of index-card, quick and easy learning method for blind people. What that reduced to was coming up with a way to simulate Braille bumps on a screen, which we implemented with vibration around the user\u2019s fingers; we converted text into Braille symbols; displayed those Braille symbols with finger-manipulable Android UI elements, and then provided auditory confirmation of a successfully mimed symbol. All these things coming together really brings back an old ghost; the taming of the thread, as well as a new challenge in making extensive use of matrix and boolean operations. Then we had to take all that and incorporate it with online databases with Firebase and Linode, which only added to the more than ample complexity of Keller.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>While our team has some experience with multithreaded Android applications and asynchronous functions through a variety of APIs and in-house solutions, what we tackled with this app was on a much higher level of complexity compared to anything we\u2019ve done before. The number of threads ramped up, and the amount of work and code we could delegate to APIs decreased dramatically. What resulted was a lot of clever work to create an intuitive user interface for blind people, text to speech to read back what you\u2019ve just learned, and speech to text so you can even read it back and confirm it for certain. Keller really ends up becoming, then, almost like a Braille teacher all on its own.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We really learned a great deal about the less common sides of Android development. File manipulation, camera usage, and asynchronous task management, were among these aspects. We also needed to learn a lot about databases and HTTP GET and POST calls to properly and effectively interact with data.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s next for Keller</h2>\n<p>One of our initial goals was to create a way for Keller to be used over Amazon Echo. Echo has a great deal of artificial intelligence that would assist with the accurate study of Braille. A way that we would leverage this AI would be to quiz users on Braille that they have already learned through the Learning Modules, or that they have intentionally added to the Braille Book themselves. This would also increase usability for the visually impaired because of Amazon Echo\u2019s auditory interface.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">api</span></li><li></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tts</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stt</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">volley</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">domain.com</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cloud</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/willzma/Keller\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/willzma/Keller\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Vectorwise", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vectorwise \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/169/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>some sweet logo</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vectorwise \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/179/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>sample svg drawing</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vectorwise \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/177/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>some cool face</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vectorwise \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/537/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>ipad main page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vectorwise \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/542/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>sample low-poly triangulation </i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Vectorwise \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/546/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>iphone main page</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It's always a pain to scale an image file up and find that it's gone all jagged and pixelated. Since Olivia doubles as a coder/cartoonist, she runs into this a lot-- basically, whenever she wants to scale up images for comics or graphics for apps. (She's also terrible at using Adobe's Pen Tool, one of the standard ways of generating vector graphics. No amount of effort has helped.)</p>\n<p>The solution? Add a lot of math to it. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Vectorwise generates vector graphics (SVG files) from photo and line inputs.

How nobody really talks to each other, &amp; how hard it can be to make real friends.\nI mean, think about it. Did you introduce yourself to the person next to you when you sat down today? Are you sitting next to someone right now that you didn\u2019t know before? Did you say hi? </p>\n<p>It\u2019s funny, because you\u2019d think there\u2019d be no better place than UofM for bringing together a bunch of crazy-smart, cool people. But it doesn\u2019t really work like that.</p>\n<h1>So where do you go when you want to make friends\u2014  <em>just</em> friends, but <em>real</em> friends?</h1>\n<p>For the past three months, we\u2019ve been sending students out on <strong>blind friend-dates.</strong>\nWe've been: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>getting people out of their bubbles &amp; in the room with someone who wants to be there</li>\n<li>skipping profiles &amp; deleting romantic pretenses </li>\n<li>creating connections <strong>in real life</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The process works like this: students give us their availability, and we match them up with someone who is also free at that time on Friday (which is when Argo dates take place!). We tell them when &amp; where to meet, but we don't reveal <strong>who</strong> they're meeting until they actually arrive. We've been doing this manually over the course of the last semester, and after sending out 70 students on 45 Argo dates and getting really positive feedback, we decided to automate the process. </p>\n<h1>MHacks - what we built</h1>\n<p>Using Angular.js, javascript, &amp; Firebase, we were able to create a website that not only functions the way we need it to on the backend -- eg, stores user data, matches users based on time/availability alone, and automates emails -- but also creates a warm, fun user experience that will make it easy and exciting for our users to sign up and get involved.

The glove is paired with a Myo armband to read the movement of the person's arm which, when combined, can create a complete reading of the full gesture. The feedback from the flex sensors is handled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller that processes that data from each finger and breaks it down into whether the finger is in a fully open, partially open, or fully closed position and is all put together to determine the entire status of the hand. The data is then sent to a website, created from HTML, CSS, and Javascript, that provides a little more info on the project, but more importantly outputs what the gesture is  in both audio and visual form and real-time tracking of the sensors. This is accomplished through Firebase transferring it in to the site and an API called ResponsiveVoice.JS for speaking the meaning of the gesture.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> I thought I would just need the Myo and maybe an Arduino and speaker.

However, a tangible way such as those to keep track of our happy moments would be tedious, non-portable, and limited in size. We wanted a simple, convenient way to remember all the good things in our lives.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>JoyJar tracks memories along with their date and a photo. Users provide the memory and photo, the system clock provides the date. This information is displayed conveniently to remind them easily of their happiest times. </p>\n<h2>Applications in the world</h2>\n<p>JoyJar can aid in treatment for several psychological and mental disorders, memory-related and emotion-related.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our team built JoyJar in less than 36 hours at MHacks: Refactor. We were all interested in iOS app dev, but had no idea where to start. We started by doing a tutorial that built a single table-view app. We then used our new knowledge of table views and simple view controllers to create a single-page view application with all its private instance data in a Realm mobile database. We did not have access to any advanced graphic design tools, so we designed our program art on a mobile art app called Paper. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our biggest challenge was getting ahold of the language and grasping the concept of how the UI elements in the Xcode storyboard interacted and reacted with the code in the supporting .swift files. This was overcome, though with a lot of struggle, with the help of the awesome mentors at MHacks. Another challenge we encountered was a lack of Swift experience and answers on websites such as StackOverflow since it is a fairly new language. A specific technical challenge we ran into was not being able to store user images as instance variables of the Memory objects in a Realm database, since they are not primitive data types in Swift. We solved this problem in our application by first converting the images to NSData to store in the realm, then converting them back to their initial form to display them.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud that we came into our first hackathon without an idea of what to accomplish or what to expect, but came out with a functioning program. Secondly, we are proud that we were persistent and did not get intimidated by the huge amount of new information we had to absorb during the dev process. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the basis of a whole new language, but our real gains came elsewhere. We learned how to learn a language. Going through the cycles of failure, trying and retrying, has taught us more than sitting in a comp sci classroom and memorizing a textbook. </p>\n<h2>What's next for JoyJar</h2>\n<p>There's definitely many more features and ideas we can envision JoyJar having. Increased functionality and a more robust user experience are our priorities for the next build of JoyJar. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">realm</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">paper-app</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">paper</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">paperapp</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I helped write the code and worked on the storyboard.

We wanted a better way to suggest features and report bugs. After talking to the sponsors at MHacks: Refactor, we discovered that a lot of companies would also love to have a better way.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Companies sign up to use our platform so that all of their bug reports and feature requests can be consolidated and prioritized more easily. They simply post their products and send their users to the product page on FeatureQuest. Product-users can vote on their favorite feature ideas and bug fix requests, and submit new feature requests and bug reports. As they type new ideas or bug reports, related issues are filtered automatically so they can just upvote the idea or bug report which has already been submitted. This is a huge help to the companies because it prevents massive duplication of issues, a problem with alternative solutions such as Jira, Jive, plain old email, etc.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We're using a simple Express Node.js server with the Handlebars templating engine. For our database, we use Firebase to make real-time updates a piece of cake. We hosted on Linode using Nginx and Nodemon.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Finding a fuzzy search library and getting it fine-tuned, not reading Firebase docs carefully and expecting a totally different response from an API call, accidentally using Javascript's Array.prototype.sort wrong, getting set up with Namecheap and Linode, and numerous others.

An app that allows you to draw your own font (or secret code) and save it online would be super helpful for all of the artsy pinterest-oriented font-lovers out there.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user is prompted to carefully draw each English letter multiple times. The resulting images are converted into XML glyph format via iOS movement tracking (eventually, these glyphs can be assembled into a .svg file for an official UTF8 font).

I had originally planned to make an app that uses an iOS OCR API to analyze user input, and then manually create a .ttf file. However, after researching .ttf files I found that they basically resemble executables - not the kind of file you can just open in vim... I spent at least an hour looking for an algorithm to manually convert an image or template to .ttf with no avail. Further research showed that there wasn't an iOS API for creating .ttf or .svg files. I met with an iOS mentor for guidance with file type conversions, who sent me to web dev. The web dev mentor and I tried to figure out how to send a post request to <a href=\"http://www.myscriptfont.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.myscriptfont.com/</a>, which theoretically would produce the desired .ttf, which turned out to be a huge mess because of one mysterious parameter in the url. I then was advised by various sponsors to investigate the use of .svg font files instead of .ttf (which can be opened in vim!). However, I have no prior experience with XML, and manually creating an OCR that produces a glyph object took a lot of research and diagrams. I've also been really frustrated by objective-c in general lately... NSUserDefaults absolutely refuses to accept my main data structure, and it's been a huge struggle to pass font information in this data structure between view controllers. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm really proud of the ability to create a glyph object from a physical iOS motion and the in-app custom keyboard.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a ton about file types, font making and the math behind it, and XML. </p>\n<h2>What's next for selfScript</h2>\n<p>Adding functionality to the tableview containing various fonts.

We believe that the internet can be used for digital transactions without centralized mediation. In particular, we wanted to tackle the idea of device sharing. For example, if someone owns a television or display in a popular area, they could connect it to the Ethereum decentralized network using a device, like a Raspberry Pi. Then someone interested in advertising/using this device, they could issue a transaction to the smart contract. Through the Raspberry Pi, the television would know its contract had been filled and could display whatever the user requested, without any need for the owner of the television to be involved.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Allows Ethereum users to use our interface to interact with the Ethereum decentralized network! Through our interface, users can create and execute smart contracts to rent out devices, such as televisions or webcams, to display or record information for a period of time. This allows people to share their devices through the trustless network without a middle-man.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>First, we mapped out what it meant to be a decentralized application (Dapp) and figured out how we could use the Ethereum network alone to create contracts between users, in exchange for use of smart devices. We decided to build a web application using Meteor.js that users could use to interact directly with the blockchain. Our system handles both types of users: services and clients. Services can create contracts on the blockchain, through our UI, to make available for purchase. Meanwhile, clients who want to execute these contracts can set up a transaction to the services in exchange for use of their smart device. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Installing the Ethereum tools took much more time than we would have liked, and in the end we could not get it on each team member's computer. Although, the biggest time strain was creating a private network of nodes among our computers, that we could run our web application and display through. Finally, because Ethereum is still a relatively new frontier, the only support and FAQs available were not always helpful.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Understanding how Ethereum network and blockchain works under the hood, creating smart contracts on our group's private network, and working through the entire night, right up until the deadline.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>How the Ethereum network and blockchain works, how to use Meteor.js, and how to use Raspberry Pi's!</p>\n<h2>What's next for MiddleOut</h2>\n<p>We plan to work outside of class to finish this project!

The stepper motor turns a turntable from 0 to 180 degrees, and when the ultrasonic sensor senses a distance less than its maximum range, the turret momentarily pauses and fires a dart at the target.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>There a 3 main aspects to the turret system; 1) the triggering mechanism 2) the turntable mechanism and 3) the microcontroller.  The triggering mechanism involves a servo motor mounted to the side of the handle of the nerf gun, which when directed by the microcontroller, essentially pulls the switch mechanism responsible for the trigger reading.  The turntable is made from two 3D printed gears, one attached to the base of the nerf gun which acts as a turntable, and a smaller, keyed gear that attaches to the stepper motor.  The microcontroller is an Arduino Mega 2560 which directly controls the servo motor with PWM, indirectly controls the stepper motor through a driver chip, and reads the analog voltage values from the ultrasonic sensor.  The base of the turret is made from miscellaneous wood pieces.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were many challenges involved in this project, including problems with mounting, controlling motors, and reading sensors.  The triggering mechanism used a servo to pull a switch, but this switch had to be extracted from the internals of the nerf gun as the servo was no powerful enough to actually pull the trigger.  The switch was removed from the casing with new wiring soldered onto it, as the existing wires were not long enough.  This switch had to then be mounted in a way that the servo could touch it with its rotating arm.  The servo triggering mechanism had to be lined up with the switch perfectly for this to work.  The turntable and how to move the turret back and forth also proved difficult, and after some design iterations with different bolts and different stepper mounts, a 3D printed gear system was devised and decided upon.  The ultrasonic distance sensor was troublesome as it has a wide view angle, and thus detected motion not right in front of it.  This causes the turret to fire without any real target.  The seemingly simple setup of the stepper motor took the better half of the day, and the unipolar stepper motor was never able to run.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we created a working product that had a subset of the features we had hoped for on this project.  We worked through coding errors, wiring mistakes, mechanical challenges, and various other obstacles and created a decent project.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about Arduino, sensors, 3D printing, motors, and much more.  We learned how to control stepper motors and also how to read analog sensors.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MSnipe</h2>\n<p>The MSnipe turret system needs a more powerful motor upgrade, LIDAR distance sensor, and extended magazine system.  These are all future improvements for MSnipe.  Using OpenCV on python on Raspberry Pi for real-time image tracking and recognition is a reach goal.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">servos</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">stepper-motors</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ultrasonic-sensor</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nerf-guns</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">duct-tape</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wood</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">screws</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">blood</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sweat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tears</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">manpower</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lithium-ion-batteries</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wire</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">breadboards</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">plastic</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rubber-bands</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">velcro</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">3d-printed-gears</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">joe's-screwing-abilities</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">teamnosleep</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["Arduino/ breadboards\nWoodwork\nStepper motor functions\nWiring \n", "", ""]], ["Zwapp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Zwapp \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/351/409/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When people meet at events like Hackathons or other events, one of our major goals is to keep up with them and build strong connections.

Over-ambitious goals that we make, and subsequently forget, leave us dissatisfied and short of our own expectations. A lack of motivation is enough to dissuade us from the benefits of achieving important goals in life. Motiv3 aims to change all that. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Motiv3 allows users to take goal-oriented positive incremental steps towards improving their lifestyle. A user commits to three goals at the beginning of each month. In addition, he/she selects a charity to donate to if the daily goal is not met. Each morning, Alexa reminds the user of what his/her goals are for the day. During the course of the day, the user snaps a picture with Google Glass, or within the app, of the task execution. Before bed, Alexa runs through a summary of your success at achieving each of your goals. The photos for each task in a given month are displayed on the app beneath their associated goal. If a goal is not met, the money is donated to your selected charity.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>This hack involved a lot of technology that no one on the team had any experience with. It was difficult to find a way to get photos taken on Google Glass seamlessly into our app, as Glassware apps are not designed for this kind of interaction. It was also difficult connecting Alexa to our backend, so she could be updated on daily goal progress and give custom responses. Finally, adding the last step of further motivation through a donation to charity upon failure proved challenging.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're extremely proud that we were able to incorporate two emergent technologies (Google Glass and Amazon Echo) into our hack. Furthermore, we developed an android, iOS, and web app, which is challenging to do in only 36 hours. Most importantly, we're excited to have found a potential solution for goal execution, and hope users can improve their lives through our app!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<h2>What's next for Motiv3</h2>\n<p>Next, we hope to gameify the app more, allowing users to view the progress of their friends and provide feedback and motivation. We'd love to include more charities, and to introduce a leader board with daily challenges.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa\">amazon-alexa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-glass\">google-glass</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/capital-one\">capital-one</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services\">amazon-web-services</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud\">google-cloud</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/newtonjain/MhacksRefactor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/newtonjain/MhacksRefactor\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Weather Cloud", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Og9BhJOOUdI?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Weather Cloud \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/734/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted to brighten up people's morning routines. Everybody checks the weather in the morning, and we wanted to make something that would allow them to do that quickly and without having to read anything. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Pulls weather data from the cloud and changes color to reflect the conditions outside. There are six possible conditions: night, overcast, rain/storm/lightning, snow, golden, and blue skies. The cloud can also be controlled through a smart phone to turn to any of these conditions. It also has a rainbow mode -- just for fun. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We connected an Intel Edison with a Arduino Pro Mini. The Intel Edison is connected to the internet, and pulls weather data from openweathermap.org. The data is then processed in the Edison and uses binary encoding to transmit to the Arduino. The Arduino looks for the corresponding code and chooses which lightning mode to be in. The smartphone app Blynk communicates with Edison to change the mode of the cloud using a virtual dashboard of buttons -- configurable in the smartphone.  </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We never figured out how to use UART, serial, or I2C communication between the Arduino and Edison, which made trying to transmit weather data an absolute nightmare (5 hours to be exact). </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We came up with the idea to use a three bit binary encoding system with a signal bit in order to communicate weather modes. Using the three bit system we were able to define eight different settings for the cloud. This was our first time working with Intel Edison so we had to do a lot of learning on the spot. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that sometimes the easiest way to do something is not the most technologically advanced. We learned this because it ended up being more effective to use a five volt signal from an Edison GPIO pin to change the state of the pins on the Arduino Pro Mini, which in turn would time the code pushing for the pixels correctly. Also, it's OK to ask for help (the Intel guys were really and spend five hours working with us). </p>\n<h2>What's next for Weather Cloud</h2>\n<p>We want to implement more things such as relative temperature to the previous day and more weather modes. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-xdk\">intel-xdk</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/intel-edison\">intel-edison</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">blynk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/openweathermap\">openweathermap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ftdi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neopixel</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jessicaxiang/weather-cloud\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jessicaxiang/weather-cloud\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["140 M.D.", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"140 M.D. \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/521/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Our frontpage</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"140 M.D. \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/522/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sleep time analysis</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"140 M.D. \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/523/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Awake/sleep graph, and sentiment analysis</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We put out a lot of information about ourselves out there every single day. Included in that, is a bunch of metadata about when we are online, and when we aren't. We can leverage this data and, with the assumption that, on average, people are offline when they are asleep, we can infer when a given user goes to sleep, and wakes up. This may sound creepy, but we use this information to provide a user with a sleep report: how much they sleep and how that affects their mood.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web app takes in a twitter username and calculates what's called a \"Poisson Probability Distribution\", that is, the probability that the person is tweeting at any given point throughout the day. It then uses this distribution to figure out the times that the person is most likely to be awake or asleep. This is reported to the user in the form of an average wakeup and bedtime, as well as number of hours slept.</p>\n<p>We also compare each user's information with a continuously-updated firebase, so we can report numbers like \"You sleep 8h/day, that's 17% more than the average user of 140 M.D.\"</p>\n<p>Lastly, we query Datumbox's Twitter Sentiment Analysis API with the 30-ish most recent tweets from the user, to get data in the form of number of positive, negative and neutral tweets. This data is also reported as percentages of positive/negative tweets and comparisons to the average user.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We had a lot of fun thinking about how the math would work out. We built our initial experiments in python, so converting everything to a flask web app was a  natural fit. We also used firebase to maintain the state of the average user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the most interesting solutions we came up (and perhaps one of the most intuitive in retrospect) was how to convert a probability distribution of tweeting into a wakeup/bedtime, with some level of confidence. We realized that we could try fitting a binary function (one that's either off or on, sleeping or awake) to the distribution we had. That was a simple matter of minimizing the variance between the two functions. Furthermore, we could normalize that variance with the theoretical max variance for that distribution, and that gave us a way to measure how certain we were of our correctness.</p>\n<p>The other interesting math part about the project was building the probability distribution itself. To create it, we had to generate multiple poisson distributions, one for every five minutes of the day. Each of those was built by pooling the number of tweets in its \"neighborhood\" (+ or - 60 min), and dividing that by the number of minutes. This simple process gave us much more insight into out data than simply plotting numberoftweets vs. minuteofday.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're very proud of how accurate our predictions seem to be. We know of a few shortcomings of our methodology (\"what if the person just doesn't tweet when they're in class?\"), but our predictions were within reasonable estimation for our own twitter accounts.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about math and probability. We also learned a lot about how to make inferences from data. This was the first hackathon for one member of the group. There was much learning!!! Everything from Git/GitHub, Flask, HTML, Python, Ubuntu/Bash led to a really exciting learning experience. It could be a bit daunting at times, but we climbed the mountain! </p>\n<h2>What's next for 140 M.D.</h2>\n<p>One thing we want to improve in the current stack is on the limitations of the Datumbox API. It only allows us to make 1000 API calls/day, which isn't enough for analyzing the sentiment of multiple tweets per user, for multiple users. The amount of calls is also another bottleneck for the performance of our website. Lastly, we the Datumbox API only provides us with positive/negative/neutral sentiment classification. We believe more insight could be gathered about the relationship between sleep and emotion, if we had more intricate emotion classification (anger/sadness/happiness/etc). </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twitter\">twitter</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/iRapha/140_MD\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/iRapha/140_MD\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["electionmate", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Very incomplete</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sendgrid\">sendgrid</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/wzwright/electionmate\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/wzwright/electionmate\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["ALL THE FEELS", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALL THE FEELS \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/759/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Opening interface</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALL THE FEELS \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/756/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Add a Feel</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALL THE FEELS \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/758/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Make the Feel</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALL THE FEELS \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/754/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Act the Feel</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALL THE FEELS \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/755/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Confirm the Feel</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"ALL THE FEELS \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/867/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>All Your Feels</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>ALL THE FEELS from A to Z</h2>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This iPhone app will address mental health and wellness; whereas some apps are concerned with specific emotions (feelings of depression or another), users can input all and any 'FEEL' they are having.

Once the establishment is located, a list of walking directions is sent to both user's devices to help direct them to the meeting point. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Node.js for our server, and Android as our platform. </p>\n<p>We receive the user's geographical coordinates using the phone's GPS, and send it to our server via <a href=\"https://www.twilio.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twilio</a>'s text messenging APIs. </p>\n<p>We then check if the coordinates that we just received would put our new user within matching range of anyone that's already in our <a href=\"https://www.firebase.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firebase</a>, and match them if they are. This pair is then sent to our pairing functions to determine the best meeting spots for them &amp; directions to it. If they aren't matched immediately however, we place them in the database as someone who's waiting to be matched. This list is updated every 5 minutes, and the old entries are deleted. The owners of these entries are notified with a \"Match not found.\" text when their entry is removed from the database.</p>\n<p>All the geographical parts are built using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Map APIs</a>. Once the geographical coordinates of two users are located, we use Google to find a list of establishments within a certain limit from the geographical midpoint of the two users, and choose one of the establishments as the meeting ground. Once the ideal location is found, we provide directions for both users to reach the meeting point, by sending them via Twilio. </p>\n<p>APIs used- Twilio, Firebase, Google Places Nearby, Google Dimension Matrix, Google Directions</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Working around callback hell was challenging, as we dealt with loads of requests to Twilio/Google servers, sometimes one right after another. We decided to learn and work with es6-promises to simplify the process of async functions. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to integrate Twilio's API's with applications in order to take advantage of using cellular service over internet service.

I usually hit \"snooze\" or turn the alarm off while I'm still half-asleep. I eventually drift back to sleep and nothing can stop me!\nMany college students (and other people) find it hard to wake up with their wake-up alarms. Most people that I have talked to are able to recognize when their alarm clock goes off, but most find it hard to get out of bed.</p>\n<p>I realized that the problem was that <em>we've grown used to alarm clocks</em>. We have learned to subconsciously push it out of slumber's way. This is why alarm clocks need a radical change in functionality.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>WakeMeUp! is built to make an alarm clock a lot less conventional and reasonably more arduous to disable. This web-based application repeatedly makes calls to your mobile phones in order to wake you up.\n<strong>The only way to stop the jarring and irritating noise of these incoming calls is to accept the call, comprehend the message and respond with a text message.</strong> These actions require concentration and the use of physical and mental faculties, further awakening a user. The user is now thrust out of slumber, and is more likely to wake up successfully.\nApart from the web-interface, users can also send text messages to WakeMeUp to set and unset alarms.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I implemented all calling and messaging features in the application using the <a href=\"http://twilio.com/api\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twilio API</a>. I hosted all application files on a virtual private server and implemented the back-end using PHP and SQL scripts coupled with a MySQL database to store data. I used a cron job to periodically run a script to initiate calls to users with alarms set.\nI created the front-end of the website using the <a href=\"http://materializecss.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Materialize framework</a>. Some functionality required the use of the <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JQeury library</a>.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I had never used an API before, and learning how it worked through experimentation took some time.\nThe web application accepts a single alarm time for each user. I ran into trouble while trying to convert them into dates in order to check if an alarm had to be set off. One potential solution to my problem would not work for alarm times that had to be set off after midnight. Finally, I restructured the MySQL table to enable it to take other qualifying parameters. This required the modification of most of the scripts in the application, thus requiring further detailed testing.\nAlso, since I worked on this project individually, I lacked the advantages of working with a team. There were times I felt overwhelmed by seemingly-random bugs while coding, and I missed a few pairs of eyes to help me review the code. WakeMeUp! has a lot of scope for expansion of features and user experience, and I was unable to tap into this due to limited time and resources.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm excited to have developed this radical new form of alarm clocks. I'm especially excited because I actually built an alarm clock that I know will work for me, as well as for many others that I know!\nI also successfully learned to use and implement an API in a project.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The importance of working in a team \u2014\u00a0I doubt I will ever come to a hackathon without a team again!</li>\n<li>The power of abstraction in APIs, and how they enable us to \"stand upon the shoulders of giants\" and create amazing new applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for WakeMeUp!</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to set alarms by sending a text message</li>\n<li>Ability to set alarm clocks based on the user's time zone</li>\n<li>Ability to customize the kind of wake-up-challenge.

We wanted to build an user-friendly and democratized tool that would provide instantaneous language translations for users even when they aren't near a Wifi source or have access to cellphone data. We also wanted to create something that would assist tourists and foreigners in connecting with locals more easily by providing an application that would translate universal phrases. </p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>Adele is a SMS language translator is the quickest way to get language translations via SMS. Any time. Anywhere. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our first step was to find out how to interface with Google's Translate API with Nodejs. Using Google's REST API for Google Translate and a REST client called Postman we figured out how to communicate with the Translate API. Next we had to communicate with Twilio's API to send and receive text messages. We essentially created a server with Nodejs that would listen on a certain port for messages from Twilio's API. We would then process the user's request via a call to the Google Translate API and send them a response. All the of programming was done in web with mostly JavaScript, HTML/CSS, jQuery. To remotely host the service, we used Linode's servers and ran the both the ngrok and node processes using the tmux command.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>When trying to interface with the Twilio API, we had to solve how to send and receive text messages. We were running two Nodejs servers at the same time, so no calls to the Twilio API were being sent/receive. In addition, we faced a challenge when trying to get data from the Translate API, as the data being sent from the Translate API was unusually formatted.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Being able to send and receive text messages on demand with separate JavaScript functions. Finding a relatively simple format for users to send in queries.Configuring a Linux server and having the whole service run remotely.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that JavaScript's callback functions are useful and can prevent redundant from dirtying the code.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Adele</h2>\n<p>Natural language processing: being able to call Adele and get back a voice message that is translated\nTranslating characters\nBetter/more translations\nFaster service</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-translate\">google-translate</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://gloriayu.me/Adele/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://gloriayu.me/Adele/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>gloriayu.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/saiarvindg/mhacks2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/saiarvindg/mhacks2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Smart Teddy", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Smart Teddy \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/974/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Smart Teddy \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/353/955/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The inspiration for Smart Teddy grew out of the fact that children are sometimes unable to communicate their exact feelings with regards to their health, especially if they live with a mental illness. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Smart Teddy is a health monitor toy that tracks the child's movements, temperature, and their sense of touch throughout their development. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built an Intel-Edison board into a stuffed plushy, with gyroscope, temperature, and touch sensors to to  detect these physical data from the child.

However, we know that just because something is out there, doesn't mean it's factual, reliable, or unbiased.

Confused by piles on piles of suggestion tutorials, confusing demonstrative videos, and conflicting opinions online, the individual is left behind in a flury of barbells and dumbbells. Deterred by the murky swamp they've entered into, the individual soon quits in frustration. What many people don't know is that the healthcare professionals are there specifically at the disposal of any help requested. Those who do know this, however, are typically shy to request help publically as they want to pursue a 'naturality' image, attempting to project themselves as anything <em>but</em> newbies. Capital One is great when you know what you need... But as a new gym user, you have no idea!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>GymGo provides on demand personal training sessions and gets feedback from healthcare professionals 'for free' on any particular workout. Custom built workouts are built online and pushed to android phones. The client is then able to access their workout through a Google sign-in. They can then start their workout, pressing a simple button on their phone whenever they run into a hitch in the road. If the button is pressed, it enters the queue of individuals seeking assistance. The healthcare professionals may choose to respond to each person in the queue and will arrive promptly to the individual's location. The individual may also choose to turn the help into a personal training session via a Capital One transaction on their phone and gain the benefits of their own healthcare professional at their service. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Capital One, blood, sweat, and tears. Hours were spent on the web development of flowing the jsons and laravel queries</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Android development, Capital One, and learning the laravel framework. Perhaps the greatest challenge was to understanding how the laravel csrf tokens mismatch any exceptions. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are hugely proud of implementing Capital One into our framework that is built with Linode. Especially, we are proud of learning android development within only 36 hours. The hardest part was definitely working on android with no android experience in the team at all. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Laravel, android, the extremely easy and fluid functionality of Capital One and Linode, as well as how little sleep we can survive on while still maintaining maximum productivity.</p>\n<h2>What's next for GymGo</h2>\n<p>We are seriously interested in continuing this project beyond just this weekend. We plan to scale the app up so that any gym can use it immediately, and polish the android app so it looks more appealing to clients. We aim to market this app towards any gym at all - the marketing potentials are limitless.

Each time after the client or consumer utilizes a service, they can enter a code found on their receipt into our app. Once on out app, they'll be able to connect their credit card and take a short survey. In return for their time and opinion, they'll receive a small sum of money into their bank account. Survu supplies companies with affordable data while also helping the general public using the app benefit. </p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When the four of us were brainstorming ideas, we knew that we wanted to build something that would help people in their everyday lives. Something that would be able to benefit different sides of the society. One of our team members personally knew someone who had said that they wished they could collect more data on their customers. The primary way that stores can do this is through surveys. However, if you're anything like a typical person, chances are, you usually don't take the time to complete them. They can often feel like a waste of time, which is why we decided to provide an incentive for taking the survey as well. This way, both the company and the customers leave feeling satisfied - the company receiving the data they need and the customers walking out with a bit more cash in their hands. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Survu is built on React Native, using mostly javascript, Firebase and the Visa API. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>There were quite a few challenges that we had to face along the way, mostly to do with React Native and the Visa API. No one on our team had much experience with react, javascript nor react native. Therefore, we had to spend much of the beginning first learning the skills needed in addition to figuring out just exactly what we were capable of. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very proud of the fact that we were able to get a _ native _ app running with a survey platform that we built from scratch with the Visa payment API. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Not only did we learn a whole lot of new technologies, we also learned about the workflow of an app that requires the server and a database. As for the technologies, we learned a whole new language (react-native) and how to incorporate Firebase into mobile development (it was really shockingly fast!).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Survu</h2>\n<p>When builiding this app, we were mainly focusing on the base case of having restaurants as our clients that want data. However, Survu can be scaled to almost anywhere! Since all sorts of organizations and services could benefit from further market research, Survu is a good service to provide the data in a rewarding way in both the business and the customer (the ones doing the survey) side. In the future, Survu can be expected to be seen at concerts, department stores and maybe even hackathons! </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visa\">visa</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/joanna-chen/mhacks16\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/joanna-chen/mhacks16\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Split It", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Split It \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/771/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Split It \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/772/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Split It \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/773/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>This idea came to us after our trip to Miami over winter break where, whether it be for the hotel or the bike rentals, everywhere we went someone ended up paying for the group to make things easier.

A very common problem among people like us is ergonomics, mainly carpel tunnel and back pain. Some software engineering companies hire in house ergonomists in order to support their employees. We thought it necessary to build a framework which could help everyday developers improve their ergonomics and maintain proper body positioning to stay healthy through their long programming sessions, almost like having an on hand ergonomist at all times.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using Thalmic Laboratory's Myo to track hand and forearm positions we warn the programmer when they are in a position that can cause damage to their carpal tunnel. Using OpenCV and a webcam we ensure that the programmer knows when their posture can lead to high back stress. Furthermore, we provide reminders relating to health throughout the hacking/computer session.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The Myo's sensors provide an abundant amount of information about the position of the wearer's hands. Using this information, we train Neural Networks so that our service is tailored towards each user and can best identify their specific ideal arm/hand positions. We used another Neural Net to again tailor our service's posture identification to every user. Most of the program is written in NodeJs but we have a number of scripts written in Python that interact with the Node app during runtime.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Neither one of us had any hands on experience with working with big sets of data and training neural networks, so this was a huge challenge. More difficult was figuring out that more information isn't necessarily better - we had to ignore more than half of the available information from the Myos and plenty of pixel data from the webcam. Furthermore, we had some trouble connecting the Python portions of our project with the Node.JS portions to form one cohesive experience.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We worked really well together to create a project that we both found important and interesting, while learning entirely new concepts along the way. By far we are most proud of managing to train algorithms to help prevent problems we are all too aware exist (if only we had Ergomyonic during this hackathon, cause we're definitely feeling the effects of 36 hours of programming).</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ergomyonic</h2>\n<p>The sky's the limit baby.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neural-networks</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv\">opencv</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/noamlerner/Ergomyonic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/noamlerner/Ergomyonic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Disneyfication", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Agastya, being a man of many Disney Princesses, has always wanted to show his passion for Disney film.

The character you choose follows a variety of your facial motions at 10 frames per second. Skype webcam streaming is also supported. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>There are two primary components to Disneyfication. The first component is the \"Animation\" pass, where we extract crucial animation data from the face in order to get the general overall position of the varying face pieces. The second component is the \"Sentiment\" analysis pass, where we extract emotional data from the picture via a deep recurrent neural belief network, and attempt to have the character mimic the user's emotional expressions. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The main challenge we ran into was the training and later loading of our deep neural network.

Having dedicated much of our high school lives to the pursuit of knowledge in science and mathematics, we were graced by the invention of Mathematica by Mr. Wolfram, making our journey significantly easier. We wanted to take the next step in making visualization of complex surfaces even easier by being able to visualize them in virtual reality. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Riplr is a web application that allows the user to easily visualize complex surfaces and structures in a virtual reality environment with an Oculus Rift. By typing in specific commands, users are able to plot surfaces and modify certain variables at will to the general shape and how it changes. Of course, it is also capable of plotting multiple surfaces at a time, making it easier for users to look at intersections compared to picturing them mentally or drawing on paper. Users are also able to live edit their plots in the VR environment, making it easier to alter their surfaces </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The team used a Javascript libraries to develop our own version of a plotting library. We wrote wrappers to make the application more user-friendly as it avoided large amounts of coding and focused instead on the visualization aspects. We also implemented a live-editing text environment to allow users to code what they want to see in the application. The text inputted would be parsed through our wrapper to deliver the surfaces. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>As a team with little background in virtual reality, it was a challenge for us to pick up the VR coding practices in javascript. However, with some research and studying, we were able to adapt quickly and develop our application. There were also minor challenges throughout the project involving working with the Javascript libraries, but we were ultimately able to work around them. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm proud of the fact that we were able to create a powerful surface-imaging application despite our lack of experience in the hardware and virtual reality fields. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Learned about Javascript as I never used it before. Also learned about transitioning 3D to VR. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Riplr</h2>\n<p>The next step for Riplr would be to include more dynamic interaction with the plots and maybe plotting them in different coordinates. We will likely proceed from surfaces to things such as parametric equations and data plots to analyze statistical trends. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mathbox</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/2amp/RiftPlot/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/2amp/RiftPlot/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Shia LaBUFF", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5b67Is-Njw?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shia LaBUFF \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/905/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A cropped image 3</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shia LaBUFF \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/904/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The GUI!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shia LaBUFF \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/903/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A reflection on the run is shown at the end of every workout</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shia LaBUFF \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/165/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shia LaBUFF \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/166/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shia LaBUFF \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/167/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Shia LaBUFF \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/350/168/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I learned that the best way to develop one's physical body is with intensive and critical feedback.

You start by simply connecting your Capital One account info and providing a budget that you'd like to stick to.

That's why people have come up with arcane ways of sharing music such as splitting ear buds so each person only hears half of the total sound. We wanted to solve this issue because we wanted to share our music without degrading the quality for anyone...and we didn't want distance to be a factor.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Hymn is a music synchronization platform built upon the music platform we all know and love: Spotify. Hymn works using the concept of \"spaces\". Let's say Bob wanted to share his favorite song, Hymn for the Weekend, with his friend Joe. He could go onto our app and create a space. A space is the centerpiece of the Hymn experience. A space has a master\u2013\u2013in this case Bob. Bob can pick whatever song(s) he wants to play and it plays at the exact same time on everyone's phone. The second Bob changes the song, the song changes on everyone else's phone. The entire process is completely synchronized. And this can take place anywhere. Bob can show Joe his music from 10,000 miles away (so long as both Bob and Joe have an internet connection. But, spaces aren't just limited to Bob and Joe. Bob can invite as many people as he wants to the space by simply sharing his space's identifier (which is always easily pronounceable) or the accompanying scannable QR code. For the first time ever, Bob, Joe, Fred, and up to millions of others can listen to the exact same song at the exact same time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The Hymn platform involves a centralized server running on Linode and an iOS app. The magic of the app is done on the server. Using a combination of websockets and intricate timing techniques, we've managed to almost perfectly synchronize streams without much delay or hiccup. Our server is able to instantly update huge numbers of devices to keep on the proper timing standard.</p>\n<p>The other component, the iOS app, serves as an advanced client. Because even a delay of a quarter of a second is so noticeable, we handled certain algorithmic portions of the app client side to maximize speed and stability.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The hardest part was the balancing act of speed and accuracy vs hiccups. The more we forced each device onto the exact same timecode, the more hiccups we experienced. We spent hours finding the exact right combination (and incorporated other techniques to lessen the impact of the downsides of certain strategies) of refresh times, bit rates, and buffer zones from the central clock.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>When we started, we weren't exactly sure if we could get the system to actually work well. When it did, we were thrilled.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Hymn</h2>\n<p>We'd like to add more client side features just as handing off the admin privilege of a space, a detailed history, and collaborative queuing system.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">quick-response-codes</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jasonscharff/hymn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jasonscharff/hymn\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the iOS app.", ""]], ["Spong", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Spong \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/349/183/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Devin and Max playing Spong</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>For a while, I've been wanting to get into the NES homebrew development scene. I have some experience making homebrew Nintendo DS games, and I really want to get back into simple hobbyist game creation. So for this MHacks, I created Spong!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Spong is a simple video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) that puts two players in control of space ships, and pits them against each other. Armed with a blaster and a shield, players will find the game fast-paced, addictive, and extremely fun.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The NES comes equipped with a modified Motorola 6502 processor, and so the game was coded entirely in 6502 assembly language. I used a community-made assembler called NESASM3 and a graphical tile-editing program called YY-CHR. Once compiled into a NES ROM, I was able to play the game on my PC through an emulator. But in order to get the real experience, I ordered a flash cart that lets me flash game ROMs onto an actual NES system, specifically the NES PowerPak from RetroZone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Assembly language is notorious for being difficult to debug, since small errors can manifest into very big problems that can be hard to diagnose. I came across several of these during MHacks, but managed to solve all of them in one way or another in order to produce a playable game.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I'm definitely proud that people really seem to enjoy playing the game. It means a lot that other people can enjoy something I developed.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about what it takes to develop a (retro) game, and I hope to continue working on hobbyist NES games.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Spong</h2>\n<p>Better graphics!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nintendo-entertainment-system</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nes-powerpak</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">6502-assembly-language</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nesasm3</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">yy-chr</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Rapid", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Prototyping apps right now sucks.

What a pain? Why can't this be as easy as venmo? So I decided to work on an easy way to process concur expense reports into direct bank transactions</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our front end allows Concur administrative users to hook up their concur instances to our system, and add employees, who can add their banking information. The front end provides employees a list of transactions processed through Coincide, and administrative users for a company a list of all transactions processed on that companies behalf, along with transaction confirmation numbers, and source and destination account information.</p>\n<p>Our back end, written in python, polls the Concur API on behalf of each company connected to Coincide, when it finds a fully approved unpaid expense report for a user it has banking information for it requests a transfer using the Nessie API by Capital One, records the transaction for the front end to access later, and informs Concur that the expense report has been paid.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Lots of red bull! But seriously, we started by white boarding the main elements (The front end, the Concur interface, the Nessi interface, and the back end). We then broke down each element into what we needed from it, and what the business intelligence running in the background would do (in psuedocode), after that, it was a \"breeze\" to actually implement.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into some issues getting the APIs to play nice, but this was mainly due to forgotten headers.

Instead, I was left with Linux's Window's-equivalent blue screen of death and a terminal.</p>\n<p>The day before I remembered installing a bunch of new packages and some repository-external packages to set-up pyqtgraph and attempt to try and activate its 3-D volume rendering which wasn't working for some reason. Apparently, something about making these changes completely disabled the GUI part of my machine after rebooting. I needed to remove the package(s) that was causing the error.</p>\n<p>APT is the go-to package manager for Debian and Debian derivative systems such as Ubuntu and Linux Mint. While apt-get provides numerous of features, I discovered surprisingly that apt-get lacked a feature that removes all changes within a set period of time, such as a request to restore your package state to what it was 12 hours ago when it was working.</p>\n<p>Users over the Internet suggest that the best possible way to go about restoring your package configuration to a state earlier would be to tediously read an ugly log file and manually go through and make the countless changes yourself. So, instead, my team and I wrote a Python script and text-based GUI that makes the package changes for a user given the amount of hours to go back in time with. Given this input, the program would allow the user to revert any installs/removes done via apt-get over the specified time frame.</p>\n<p>This is a feature that can be utilized by countless users and is fundamentally useful for any APT users (or, really, anyone who uses Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and others).</p>\n<h1>Philosophy</h1>\n<p>GNU/Linux is the operating system playground for the hacker's drive to experiment and find new ground. Users shouldn't have to always be super careful about packaging. The average user isn't running a server that has dire consequences for something going wrong. Having a tool that supports a GNU/Linux hacker drive to experiment.</p>\n<p>As well, managing packages is something more unique to GNU/Linux operating systems and as such it is a barrier to new users. New users shouldn't have to go through log files to fix mistakes. Having features that support new users with extra functionality that eases their entry into GNU/Linux would help foster more of its use and implementation.</p>\n<h1>What's next?</h1>\n<p>Eventually, we'd like to get full integration in C++ to the APT package. If our idea and/or code were to be added, we would have made a contribution to a core Linux package found on most Linux systems by default. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apt-get</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/love\">love</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bisli/apt-get-reverse\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/bisli/apt-get-reverse\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the python parser going through the log file to track the time for each change in order to make the command line functions of apt-get remove and apt-get install.", "I made the GUI and worked on the parsing engine for the project.

It was created to allow machine learning algorithms to run more efficiently on images by compressing them using pre-computed features. Further, the femto methodology can be reduced smaller than the size of a jpeg without sacrificing information and is transmissable by text, making it both lightweight and low overhead.</p>\n<p>The femto suite includes an automated setup tool for Apache Spark (PySpark) and the SciPy stack on Linode servers, allowing distributed scientific computing using master and slave configurations on multiple machines.</p>\n<h1>The Intuition</h1>\n<p>Femto treats images as an array of pixels and performs singular value decomposition to isolate important features. The singular values are encoded using a collection of performance optimizations (including multi-stage clustering to increase redundancy, indexing using k-strings, and standard text compression) on the server side. A pre-chosen amount of encoded data is then sent to the client where image reconstruction or data analysis takes place.</p>\n<h1>Performance</h1>\n<p>The femto protocol manages to compress large TIF images by up to 8 times without significant loss in quality or information. Additionally, femto is between 40% and 50% of the size of JPEG encoding (when converting from large TIF or Raw files).</p>\n<h1>Tested Use Cases</h1>\n<p>Femto has been tested using clustering algorithms (Lloyd's) and computer vision algorithms (blob identification). While being a smaller file, the reconstructed images using the femto protocol were just as accurate as uncompressed TIF images while being faster to complete.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linode\">linode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">apache-spark</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">jupyter</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">computer-vision</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexcordover/femto\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexcordover/femto\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the mathematics behind and the optimization of the compression engine, built the grayscale compression and reconstruction engines, and implemented the computer vision test case.", "I was in charge of creating a distributed system using spark and linode servers.

Users that have logged in with Facebook credentials are able to create new songs, see what songs they have posted in the past, and search for songs that other users have added. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Two members of our group have had quite a bit of experience with PHP, and so we decided to teach the other two members of our team PHP while expanding on what we have learned before by using the Laravel PHP framework (allows more intuitive MVC design among many other things), and by using Firebase as our database. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting started is usually really easy, but we had to work rapidly at the end to finish some problems with our database connections to the site, which was confounded by the fact that we hadn\u2019t slept in more than 40 hours. I got to the point where I couldn\u2019t remember what I was doing from the time I found a problem to the time I got back in the code and found the problems location. These were fun challenges though, we had a great team.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Having a fully functional prototype was very important to us. We wanted something tangible to show off so that we could feel productive and successful at the end of MHacks. We did it! There is always more that would be fun to add, but we will hopefully be getting that done in the next couple weeks. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Some of our group had never touched web dev before, and some of our group had lots of experience, so our learning was both broad and very deep.</p>\n<h2>What's next for The Master of the Chords</h2>\n<p>We plan to finish working out the kinks, and it will be online in the next couple weeks!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/laravel\">laravel</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php5\">php5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://masterofchords-mhacks7.rhcloud.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://masterofchords-mhacks7.rhcloud.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>masterofchords-mhacks7.rhcloud.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alexlovescoding/masterofchords\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alexlovescoding/masterofchords\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on backend and frontend and helped integrate the Firebase API into the project.

Their mortgage, their student loan, their children's student loan, these are all contributors to the overall complication of the process of paying back their debt. As such, most people resort to methods of debt repayment such as paying off the load with the lowest principle value, such that they feel that there are less to do later on. However, these methods are sometimes not the best way, meaning that the amount of debt incurred from interest tend to be greater than the lowest possible value.\nDue to these apparent scenarios, we aimed to design an android app that makes this entire process easier to carry out, while also determining the best method to repay the debt. \nBasically, we help people save money.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Calculates potential methods of repaying the debts, and optimise the user's experience by making the process much easier and cheaper.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Android studio is the most important part of our android app, as it was the software that we mainly used for the back-end and the front-end design.\nFor the app to functionally be competent, we also had to do extensive research on methods of calculating debt repayment to optimise for the outcome of the total loan repaid based on the interest and the principle amount of debt.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Initially, we tried to manually determine which method of repaying the loan will save the customers the most money.

We specifically focused on the use case of scheduling events with your groups. Email listservs tend to be inconvenient in two ways: most people don't check their email very often. Usually at the beginning of the day or the end of the day. Group chats tend to be too noisy and intrusive and are constantly notifying you even after you are no longer interested in the topic.  </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>If you want to organize an event, you login and put in a group name. Twilio automatically generates a phone number for this group. With this number, you can tell group members to text their name to the number. When this happens, the web app creates a log of all the group members and their numbers. Once this happens, you (the organizer) completes this web form. This web form lays out the types of responses that would be sent out to group members. The first one is the initial event invitation that goes to everyone in the group. It ends with asking group members to reply \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"maybe\". The group members respond and the web app is able to show the organizer how many people replied with \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"maybe\" to the event. From there, the form allows the organizer to create a response to the various results. However, no further dialogue would occur with those who replied \"no.\" To those who said \"yes\" there'd be one more email with extra info. For those who said \"maybe,\" there'd be a delayed response asking if they have made a decision about whether or not to attend. \nTextsilvousplait is also good because it is not a traditional app. Therefore, there's no need to deal with iOs and Android compatibility.

We were also proud of the fact that all of us learned every single one of these systems for the first time and then managed to build it and make it work. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use Ruby on Rails, we learned how to use Firebase, and we learned how to use the Twilio API.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Textsilvousplait</h2>\n<p>We realized there are certain limitations to having a single number assigned to a single group. There couldn't be any overlap with events being scheduled because the replies wouldn't know which even it would be in reference to. Also, we were exploring the idea of having your phone contacts sync up with the web app so you can manually select who you'd like to add to your group of members. Even though these were beyond our scope, it was still good to consider these things and how we'd tackle them in the future. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">imagination</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.textsilvousplait.me\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.textsilvousplait.me\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.textsilvousplait.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SMSRSVP\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SMSRSVP\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["ruby on rails\ndesign", "Collaborated to develop Twilio and Firebase API integration.", ""]], ["Mucha", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mucha \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/741/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Example game board</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mucha \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/763/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Example game board 2</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Mucha \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/769/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Example card</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As an avid gamer, I've always been interested in creating and developing games, and Mucha has been a simple game that I was able to build to help me get some experience in the world of hackathons.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Mucha is a simple card game.  It is a battle between two players, with the goal being (of course) to kill the other player.  Each player has a variety of cards at their disposal, of which there are two different types: minions and spells.  Additionally each turn the players get a certain amount of mana to use.  Each card has a different mana cost based on its power, and the amount of mana players get increases over time.  Minions can be summoned onto the board, after which they can attack either the opposing player's minions or attack the opposing player directly.  The first player to have their health dropped below 1 loses!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Entirely inside of Eclipse using Java.  Some work was done to create the cards from scratch (the art is mostly from an artist named Alphonse Mucha, which is who the name of the game is derived from), but aside from the art, I designed the cards.  For different minions, there are 20 different minion \"types,\" which means that there are 20 different names and corresponding pictures.  Each minion is randomly generated with an attack value from 0 to 10 and a health value from 1 to 10, and the cost is calculated based on these two numbers.  The spells were hard coded into the game, but it would be simple to add more in the future.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Graphics - I did not expect the graphics section to be as difficult as it proved to be, and the game interface ended up looking clunkier than I would have liked it to be.  With more time I would set up a proper layout for the game.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Finishing the entire project alone at my first hackathon!  Although the program was not as efficient as it could have been, I'm proud of the planning that went into the program as well as of my ability to stay focused for 24 hours to get the project done.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned a lot about hackathons, meaning I learned that they're super cool and I loved the experience!  I got to work a little bit with JPanels for the first time, as well as some graphics.</p>\n<h2>What's next for mucha</h2>\n<p>Mucha could be taken much further, adding new effects or spells or a better way of balancing minions so that there aren't 10 attack 1 health minions running around or vice versa.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/srshiao/mucha\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/srshiao/mucha\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["HackerPack", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>HackerPack provides software to make hackathons better.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://hackerpack.io\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://hackerpack.io\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>hackerpack.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Buy Low, Sell High", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buy Low, Sell High \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/497/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buy Low, Sell High \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/498/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buy Low, Sell High \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/348/499/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Most people are intimidated by the stock market because they think that the only way to be successful is through endless math computations and the in-depth analyses.
