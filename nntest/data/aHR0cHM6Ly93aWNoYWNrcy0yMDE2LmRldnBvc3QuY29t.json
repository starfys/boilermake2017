you go to a tech school or work in the tech industry and have trouble finding other girls to hang out with, you\u2019re not alone. While more and more females are breaking into tech-related fields, many colleges and companies can be a majority male. In college it can be hard to find other girls to hang out with without joining a sorority or a sports team. In the industry, especially if you\u2019re new in town, it can be hard to make new female friends. That\u2019s why our team of developers created Pink Planet. This app will help connect you with other girls and women at your college or near your job. You can search by college, major, location, age, hobbies, and software/hardware interests. The app will connect through user\u2019s Facebook accounts and university or company emails so we can be sure everyone is who they say they are. It is very important to us that we help ensure the safety and comfort of all of our users. While this app puts an emphasis on girls in computing/technology related majors and women in technology related professional fields, it is open to all girls in the areas the app has launched.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bourbon\">bourbon</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neat</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/notepad\">notepad++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">quick-time</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/svaswani/Pink-Planet\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/svaswani/Pink-Planet\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android App's look, feel, and functionality.

Here we basically built up an analogy between code words and real world objects. \nFor example in C, variables are like boxes, printf acts like a printer and the standard input output library (stdio.h)  is like a manual for the printer's installation. i.e. without the installation included, the printer won't work.... and its the same way in C. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Program1: Hello World!\nAt the start of the game a mission is assigned to find the stdio.h manual and a printer.

Level 2 would be about data types . Level 3 would be a swap function puzzle. Example. int a =3; int b= 5; int temp. In the game... variables are represented as boxes.Box A holds the number 3 Box B holds the number 5. Box temp is empty. Question : How will you switch the contents of Box A and Box B in 3 moves.

For now we have Golisano as the only building options so we would add more academic buildings or even dorm side buildings. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode\">xcode</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Agent Code", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We accepted the challenge of teaching children how to code and created a review game that computer science teachers could use in their classroom.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It is a virtual board game</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>teamwork</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>time</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>the whole thing</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>how to code under a time constraint and graphics</p>\n<h2>What's next for Agent Code</h2>\n<p>multiplayer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", "", ""]], ["Stay Safe", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stay Safe \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/355/821/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Stay Safe Home Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stay Safe \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/355/849/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Stay Safe About Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stay Safe \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/355/850/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Stay Safe Locate Page, before clicking Emergency</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stay Safe \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/355/851/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Stay Safe Locate Page, after clicking Emergency</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Stay Safe \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/355/820/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Stay Safe Sign Up Page (In Progress)</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It is estimated that 35% of women have experienced sexual or physical violence in their lives. An abusive relationship is devastating, and often leaves the victim alone without a support system. We feel in order to help women escape these traumatic relationships, they require resources, and a network of people they can trust. Our goal was to put all of the necessary means to recover in one easy to access location. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The main purpose of Stay Safe is to provide resources for abuse victims within a ten mile radius of their location. By clicking on the Location tab, a list automatically shows up based on their location. </p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used html/css to build the website, and connected it to javascript and java in backend. We used the Google Maps API and the Guidestar API Clickatale</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>Trying to upload the html files to our domain that we chose proved very difficult, also choosing the correct API for our project. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Stay Safe</h2>\n<p>We plan to add a volunteer network to Stay Safe, allowing people to sign up to shelter people escaping abusive relationships. Additionally, an automatic 'help' text to be sent to a predetermined number. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.avnsvascom.domain.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.avnsvascom.domain.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.avnsvascom.domain.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.github.com/prisams/StaySafeProject.git\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.github.com/prisams/StaySafeProject.git\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]]]
