Heck, we named them didn't we? We dared to see if a computer via a Deep Learning (FishNet) could learn to recognize one object. The Betta fish Watson was our adorable test subject for this years hackathon.</p>\n<h1>How it works</h1>\n<p>That's a long story! Basically, we trained our Neural Network (NN) to recognize a fish using a tiny Python script. We click the position of the fish and data is generated. We then upload this data to Digits, a machine learning application on one of our desktops, which uses GPU horse power to \"learn\" what a Betta fish looks like.\n<img alt=\"FishNet-Trainer\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/VrmUZap.png\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--lFmP5j0l--/http://i.imgur.com/VrmUZap.png\"/></p>\n<p>We then loaded the image and coordinate data into the Application Digits, to start parsing and learning. This is a process that took us hours of fine tuning! We finally determined a model that would predict if a Betta fish in the frame, all using machine learning!</p>\n<p>After training our NN we used a model to determine if the image contained a Betta fish or not and where Watson was.\nThen using bash and python scripts we updated his image containing a caption with what the Neural Network thought he was doing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">caffe</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pygame\">pygame</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ssh</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bash\">bash</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">deep-learning</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">neural-networks</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">lenet</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">digits</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cuda</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">web-dev</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gpu-acceleration</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">betta-fish</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/QuantumFractal/Big-Betta\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/QuantumFractal/Big-Betta\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the Python script that trains the network.

The one other thing all of these failed exercise regimens have in common is that when you make them, you're really, truly committed to keeping them.  We think we have an app that can help improve this situation for goals involving pedometers and step counts. Our solution? Pay your pedometer, and put your money where your mouth is.\nOur app allows users to set a step count goal for themselves, along with a timeframe in which to accomplish it. Then, to give them an incentive to keep to their plan, they are asked to pick an amount of money to put in escrow using their Venmo account, which they will receive back as they make progress towards their goal. After that, all they have to do is click on the pedometer functionality, and walk!\nOne problem we faced in the creation of this app was that although the intended target market was users with Android Wear devices featuring pedometers, we did not actually have access to any of these devices to develop on. To work around this, we built a virtual pedometer sensor using the phone's accelerometer, which not only allowed us to develop on the hardware we had access to, but also expanded the usability of our app onto more devices. \nOne of our goals for this app was to make it visually appealing. It's one thing to make an app that keeps your money until you walk a certain number of steps, but to make an app that will encourage people and help them meet their goals, we needed it to have visual and aesthetic appeal as well. We feel that we have achieved this goal with a friendly, open feel to the app that allows users to easily navigate the app and conveys the spirit we had in mind.\nBuilding Paydometer allowed us to encounter a number of new aspects of API use. Mainly, we learned about the use of an API at all. Prior to this hackathon we had very little experience using an API, and this is in fact only the second project we've built with an API amongst all three of our team members. This experience promises to be helpful in any future development projects or hacks, as it will allow us to expand the scope of our work, and more experience with APIs can only make related work on them faster.\nLooking forward, we hope to expand Paydometer to include Facebook integration so that users can compare their stepcount to their friends'. Additionally, we hope to allow people to sponsor one another, offering extra money into the pool to encourage their friends. This feature would be of even greater use, however, to corporations. Many corporations have some sort of employee fitness program, and Paydometer would allow them to easily incentivize employees to complete wellness goals, by using the most universal motivator there is - cash.\nLastly, the app in its current state uses Venmo accounts for both the client and server, and we want to change the server side over to Braintree, which seems more fitting for this service. We attempted to set up a Braintree server here during the hack, but due to our lack of knowledge regarding ISU's network setup and policies, we were unable to get enough feedback to even determine whether it would be possible on this network.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/venmo\">venmo</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["MTGLifeApp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We all like to play Magic, and we wanted a better app to supplement our addiction.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>It acts as a comprehensive life-counter.

BykeSafe is a wearable bike vest that has integrated turn, brake, and hazard signals. </p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>We used an android app to send audio signals to a passive low and high pass filter. once filters we used different sound frequencies to turn on our LED banks on the vest. We then hooked up a Myo and programmed different gestures into the android app. So when you do your normal hand signals you also turn on the signals</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<h3>Android App Newbies</h3>\n<p>None of us had created an Android application before, nor even attempted it. As such, working out the bugs with Android Studio while learning the Android SDK was a challenge in and of itself.</p>\n<h3>Arduino? No!</h3>\n<p>Our initial design had us passing a USB signal from our Android app to an Arduino, which would then send signals to the breadboard being used to control our LEDs. After several hours of work and troubleshooting on Rex's part we decided to scrap that design, as it turned out it would require a rooted phone. This was, of course, not ideal.</p>\n<h3>Aux Output for Passing Signals</h3>\n<p>Ultimately we decided on an alternative to the arduino: by passing tones from the phone to the breadboard through an aux connection, we used high-pass and low-pass filtering on the breadboard to effectively create up to 16 different combinations of signals for the LEDs.</p>\n<h3>Signal Processing and Firmware Bugs</h3>\n<p>The Myo was difficult to work with at times. The aspects of the Myo which are integral to its advertised functionality were well-tested and worked well enough. We used one of the built-in \"Poses,\" the \"Fist\" Pose, to detect when the rider is choosing to brake. To detect the other motions important to us, however -- left and right turn signaling with the left arm -- we had to determine what data from the Myo was available for us to use. It turned out that the best way to distinguish between these movements was by periodically analyzing the yaw and pitch data sent to us from the Myo. This would have been easy enough to handle, except that our Myo had a firmware bug which caused the yaw to continually increase even when the wearable was perfectly still. We worked around this by calculating the change in yaw from one timeslice to the next, which gave us a useable (if unreliable) method of determining when a left turn was being signaled by the rider.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">breadboard</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">leds</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">signal-processing</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kristinclemens/MyoBykeSafe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kristinclemens/MyoBykeSafe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["SureLock", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SureLock \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/240/839/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"SureLock \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/240/464/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Designing features for smart homes has always been a hobby.

Even now, sometimes I'll get a tune in my head and want to write it down before it leaves. There are feature-heavy sequencing programs out there that have a lot of fancy things you can do, but when you're trying not to forget something, time is of the essence. I needed something that I could pull up and jot down notes in a hurry. This was my solution.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The menus are fairly simple, with the ability to save and open song files. The main composing interface is a five-bar music staff that scrolls infinitely to the right. The button in the upper right corner is to close off measures, and will eventually have the ability to add different bar types (double, repeat, etc) by tapping it more than once. In the bottom left corner are left and right arrows. Instead of scrolling in the usual way, the user pans right or left using the thumb of their left hand while they can draw notes with the right hand. The app isn't meant to take handwritten notes and transform them into actual music notes - it's just more of a way to sketch ideas down in a hurry. A functionality I hope to work into the app in the future is the ability to export the file to a PDF that formats it into a sheet of music. The data model already splits the drawing using the measure bars, so that will enable it to transform the data later into a printable format.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I had to learn a lot during the weekend, and it took a lot longer than I expected. I had never worked with document based apps in iOS before, and I had never worked with Core Graphics. That and, working alone, I didn't have time to finish all the features I wanted to before the weekend was over. I will just have to complete them at home!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I like the concept and how it turned out looking. It actually got a lot further than I thought it would! I came into the weekend as a newcomer to HackISU, so I was just looking to have fun and learn a lot.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned about working with document based apps in iOS, Core Graphics, project planning, and programming on a deadline with little sleep.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Song Scribbler</h2>\n<p>I hope to finish the rest of the app by the end of the semester.

We took the original idea from reading an article about the F-35 Helmet Mounted Display.  The graphical overlay was such a cool idea, and we realized that this could have many applications for civilian use as well.  We also drew from the living pictures in Harry Potter.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>The app uses BoofCV framework to do a lot of the heavy lifting involved with Image Processing.  We used a pattern detector and calibrated it to look for a flat chess pattern in the camera input.  We then calculated the 4 corners of the pattern, if it was found, and then overlayed the body of the image with a beautiful Nicholas Cage picture.  We were sure to split the screen in 2 to make it compatible with Google Cardboard.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Setting up every single framework was like pulling teeth.  Once we got them installed correctly, they worked like a charm.  We initially tried to use OpenCV for Android to do image processing, but it used a lot of deprecated system calls.  Ultimately it was finicky and difficult to set up, so we moved on to BoofCV.</p>\n<p>Initially we were simply drawing Bitmaps to a canvas object for our output, but the performance suffered. We made some optimizations and looked into using OpenGL. We started by using a framework called Rajawali, but we found that Rajawali is still too new and didn't have support for using the hardware camera. We had to write everything in raw OpenGL, and we were able to get the camera preview drawn on the screen, but we didn't get far enough in the time we had to finish implementing the same functionality that we had using the canvas.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>This was the first real Android app that any of us had made which is an accomplishment in and of itself!</p>\n<p>This is the first Google Cardboard + Android Wear app that we know of.</p>\n<p>Pattern tracking using BoofCV was a huge step.  Once we had 24 dots marking the intersecting points of the chessboard pattern, we knew we had somewhere to go off of.  Finding the 4 corner vertices of the image was also a great accomplishment since we could then send these straight to OpenGL to render the virtual screen.</p>\n<p>Finally getting the camera preview drawn in OpenGL was quite the accomplishment because we added functionality that wasn't present in a popular framework, and there are very few resources online for getting the camera preview into OpenGL.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Murphy's Law is a real thing.

Around 5am, we decide on this idea.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>FLANL = Free L.A.N. Logistics\nThe idea behind the project is to streamline the LAN party hosting process. It provides a unified solution to chat, play music, and organize games. The lightweight server could be running on any computer in the LAN, whether it's a Raspberry Pi or someones gaming PC. Because we used Node.js, it'll run on most operating systems. When you initially navigate to the page, you enter your Steam ID into the form and it will automatically get you're Steam picture to display in the chat, as well as a list of all of your games to compile into the list of 'owned games'. From there, you'll be able to see a list of all the users that are logged in on the left. Switching to the 'stats' tab will show you the list of most popular games amongst the currently logged in users. This makes it easy to see which games you'll be able to play with other participants at the LAN. Switching to the 'Music\" tab will show you the currently playing song and the next five queued songs. The idea behind this is that you can have a collaborative feed of music playing at the LAN. And since every user has the option of playing the music, a speaker setup isn't tied to the computer running the server. All it takes to add music to the playlist is a link from SoundCloud. Both songs and playlist can be added. And lastly, on the right side of the screen you'll find a real time chat of all the people logged in. As stated before, your Steam handle and picture are used as your login for the chat.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Had to start a new project mid day Saturday.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>IT ACTUALLY WORKS!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Learned some Angular, how to scrape web pages through Node, developed Git skills, and developed a a deeper JavaScript understanding.  Also, it's a good idea to see if your idea has been done BEFORE the hackathon.</p>\n<h2>What's next for FLANL</h2>\n<p>We've made it easy to include other sources of music, so it'd be nice to get YouTube or Spotify included. Converting the chat to rich text would be another straightforward progression. We'd also like to add the ability to have a voting feature so that you can call a vote to play a certain game, order pizza, etc. Some more time for more optimized styling would always be good.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/steam\">steam</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/soundcloud\">soundcloud</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Geneva", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Geneva \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/241/141/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Everyone takes screen shots.

I dread the sound that an alarm clock can make. Since the alarm clock has been in existence for as long as anybody can remember, I thought it would be cool to think outside the box on how I could approach the idea of creating an alarm clock without focusing on waking up the user through sound. There have been many weekends where I have been unable to sleep in and I have noticed that, despite how sleep deprived I was, I woke up without an alarm. How was this possible? Through nature's natural alarm clock: the sun. By waking someone up \"naturally\", this will prevent the dreaded, groggy and fatigued feeling that is experienced from abrupt alarms and tones.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>So, I didn't create a sun.. The basic idea behind how my hardware hack works is to emulate a sunrise by paying careful detail to the duration of the sunrise, the nm/wavelength produced by the sun's rays and how light/dark the room currently is.  The user will be presented with an android app that gives them 3 options. These options are setting an alarm, turning off the alarm, and snoozing. By default, snoozing will shut off the alarm for 5 minutes. There is also only one alarm available at a time. Once the alarm is activated, corresponding LED's on the breadboard structure will begin to glow. I have determined how many bytes I want to pass into each LED at a time, and this value will steadily grow to emulate the sunrise effect. The structure can be thought of as a bulleyes. There are 4 \"rows\", so, the outer layer is suppose to glow first. After 18 seconds, the second \"row\" will start glowing as well. This means that the first row will be a bit brighter than it was before. This pattern continues until the fourth row starts glowing. This all happens within 18 second intervals. by the time the \"alarm\" (lights) is at its peak, all of the LED's will be have an analogRead of \"HIGH\" or 255 bytes. This will take approximately 2 minutes and 6 seconds. So, if the user set their alarm for 7am, the \"alarm\" (aka LED's) would start to go off at 6:57:54. Another feature of the app is the ability to determine how bright the current room is. You wouldn't want your alarm to start glowing with a dim light if your room is very bright. This case is possible if the sun is already up and it is around 10-11am. If this case is met, the LED's will start on a HIGH output rather than a dim output. </p>\n<p>A brief run through the code will look something like this: \nThe arduino uses a light sensor to check the brightness of the room. From there, it will send the correct number of bytes to each row in order to maximize the potential in efficiently waking up the user. From there, it will repeat this, looping through and checking the brightness off the room each time until the user either presses \"snooze\" or \"off\" on the android app. The user has to talk into the android app and actually say the string \"off\" which will turn off the lights. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>-Bluetooth syncing: Pairing is not at all similar to connecting.\n-Parts: I felt as if the parts that I brought were not powerful/advanced enough to bring my product to its full potential. i.e. LED's weren't bright enough, breadboard allowed limited design, light sensor was too cheap and not too accurate.\n-Design: I had my own design in mind where each LED would be meticulously placed and triggered, but only having a breadboard presented many limited and challenging design problems..\n-Concurrent processes: How can you run another process without \"delaying\" everything? By using the arduino \"delay\" this presented many problems.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Me and my partner were nearly able to finish 90% of what I had in mind. The important thing that I want people to get out of looking at my project is to view my project in a bigger picture. I hope they can see what my objective was and where I am trying to go with it.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Hardware hacking is a lot of fun. Also, I should invest in a bigger range of coloured jumper wires.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Sonata</h2>\n<p>To optimize and debug this like crazy. There are many, many tweaks that I can make in order to make it much more efficient in waking up the intended user. I would also like this concept to be engraved in many other Monday haters.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">creativity</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/funbar/Sonata\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/funbar/Sonata\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["HackISU2015", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>HackISU2015</h1>\n<p>Iowa State University Hackthon 2015</p>\n<h2>Project</h2>\n<p>This project converts protein sequences to a compact RNA representation as well as converting back to protein sequences.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"Codon Amino Acids Table\" data-canonical-url=\"Codon_amino_acids.jpg\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--ij15XyPB--/Codon_amino_acids.jpg\"/>\nSource: <a href=\"http://mrsebiology75.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/4/8/5148626/9698672_orig.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mrsebiology75.weebly.com/uploads/5/1/4/8/5148626/9698672_orig.jpg</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/abradih/HackISU2015\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/abradih/HackISU2015\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Gstat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Gstat \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/240/924/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We are designing a board game of our own, and we needed an API to develop and test our game.

We wanted to fix that.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Our program integrates and extends the existing functionality of Access Plus. Where previously it performed, now it excels. </p>\n<p>While the vanilla website provides the tools students needs, our extension provides students with the features they actually want, oftentimes features that they are already using. With Access++, we've eliminated the need for constant tab switching.</p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>Access++ provides four major improvements to the Access Plus website:<br/>\n +<strong>Rate My Professor integration</strong>\u2014when viewing a schedule, a link to your professors' Rate My Professor page is provided in a clean, integrated table. <br/>\n+<strong>Useful meal plan information</strong>\u2014On the dining page, in addition to merely stating how many meals you have remaining, and linking to an obscure chart, our extension shows how that compares to the number you should have on a given day. <br/>\n+<strong>Google Calendar Integration</strong>\u2014Access++ parses your schedule and provides a downloadable ICS that can be imported to Google Calendar, Outlook, and most modern calendar programs. Events are created for the duration of a class with just a click of a button. <br/>\n+<strong>Scheduling made easy</strong>\u2014Removing the need for switching between tabs, Access++ provides your current schedule on the same page as the schedule you are creating, allowing for easy identification of conflicts and opening.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The Access Plus website is coded in a way that makes it difficult to modify. For example, standard web development concepts such as assigning IDs to elements have been eschewed in favor of the esoteric practice of embedding tables within other tables, all of which are nameless but presumably equal in society.</p>\n<h2>What was learned</h2>\n<p>This was the first time any of our team members had made a chrome extension, so everything we accomplished came from a virtually nonexistent knowledge base.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Access++|</h2>\n<p>We want to continue to develop this page, possibly adding integration to BlackBoard.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ics</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/chrome\">chrome</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["MimeStone", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"MimeStone \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/240/667/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We wanted  to hack on the pebble, and one of our best ideas was this cross between telephone, simon says, and ninja.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>Requirements: One pebble smartwatch, and friends!</p>\n<p>The players stand in a circle and one player starts with the watch in his hand. That player moves the watch in one fluid motion. To signify that the action has been recorded, the watch will vibrate and the MimeStone puts on his game face. The watch is then passed on to the next player. This player has to do the action performed by the player before him, and then add his own action. Performing the right moves makes the MimeStone happy, but getting a move wrong will make him cry and that player will be eliminated. Each successive player does all of the actions of the players before him/her, and then adds their own. When a player is eliminated the list of moves resets, and the other players continue as if they started a new game. The last player remaining is the winner ! </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>The pebble was a new piece of hardware for both of us, and the learning curve took a little hurdle on Saturday night to get over. The accelerometer on the pebble likes to give off false directions every so often, and there is no way to modify the sensitivity of the built in tap functions.

For non-ideal VLE systems, a factor called the activity coefficient must be found in order to accurately describe the system.

However, this method is very intensive and involves many complex calculations.</p>\n<h2>How it works</h2>\n<p>All one needs to do is input the VLE system components, their mole fractions, and the system temperature, and the back-end code will do the intensive calculations necessary to calculate the activity coefficients for each species in the system.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Linking my database with my javascript code.
