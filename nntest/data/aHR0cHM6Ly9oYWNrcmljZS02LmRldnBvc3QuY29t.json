Escape rooms are becoming quite a popular phenomenon these days- a group of people are locked down in a controlled environment, making their way out on the foundation of clues and teamwork. We wanted to build a similar environment using 3D renderings.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>As the name suggests, we built a scavenger hunt environment- where one user is inside the virtual escape room and second user guides them with the set of clues they are provided with.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Majority of the 3D world was built by us in Unreal Engine, integrated with Blueprints that tracks our movement captured by HTC Vive</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Due to the high benchmarks required by SteamVR, we only had one machine that we used the whole time for project development.<br/></li>\n<li>We constructed a 2 story building, but the bounds defined on both the floors kept interrupting with each other for the most part- teleporting us to undesired spots. </li>\n<li>Unable to setup a Version Control for the project due to the size of the project</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p><strong>2 CS major students- 1 Vive, 1 PC and no prior VR development experience.</strong> Yet being able to build a full 3D environment where we could accurately track movement was quite an achievement.\nBeing able to implement our own locked door-key system took quite a while, but is one of it's kind at the moment in VR development!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>No matter how many languages you know, IDE's you use, lines of code you write; there's always room for learning more! We learned how complex the game engines are and how hard it is to implement even the simplest ideas in game dev!</p>\n<h2>What's next for ScavengerHuntVR</h2>\n<p>Add more activities to make the duration of escape room last longer. Also, we would like to establish a live voice chat feature over ambient sounds in the game to make the expedience more elated.Overall, this project will help us greatly in building more VR applications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unreal-engine\">unreal-engine</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">htc-vive</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">steamvr</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on game mechanics and bug testing", "I did the level design, and worked with the game's mechanics"]], ["Dorm Automation Kit (DAK)", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbCaV-ZuATo?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;start=&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dorm Automation Kit (DAK) \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/842/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dorm Automation Kit (DAK) \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/880/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dorm Automation Kit (DAK) \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/886/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dorm Automation Kit (DAK) \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/843/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dorm Automation Kit (DAK) \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/888/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Home automation is a technology which we have seen imagined in science fiction, and only recently realized in expensive consumer products. For college students with limited funds, the price tag on such products can be prohibitive; we sought a cheaper solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The DAK is an all-in-one package which can be used to add environment-responsive behaviors to a variety of devices in your living environment. Brightness in the room can be used to determine whether the light should turn on or off; temperature can be used to control a fan; you could even extend it to water your plants when they get dry! All behaviors can be programmed using if-then statements.\nThough this project was originally developed with the dorm-room setting in mind, it is easy to imagine it being extended to settings where accessibility might be an issue. Any number of electronic devices can be used to interface with the room, allowing those with mobility impairments to switch on and off their lights easily. Voice control may even be used to interface with the system, permitting those with extreme disability to control their living environment. Finally, emergency notifications may be sent in case of extreme temperature conditions, allowing for care of elderly or otherwise vulnerable individuals.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The DAK runs on a lightweight Node.js server, which provides an interface with the Arduino device, the database, as well as the user. Because the DAK exposes a simple API, any number of devices and softwares can be integrated to control the room.\nWe used an Arduino as the platform for our hardware because they are cheap and easy to learn! This means that it's possible for students and makers everywhere to make their own DAK, and even extend it to include new functionality.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Hack-a-thons are brief; it's difficult to assemble a complex project involving both hardware and software in such a short period of time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We managed to assemble a functional system which sends and receives information from the living environment.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>It's challenging to prototype, design, and develop a hardware+software project, but it's also a ton of fun!</p>\n<h2>What's next for Dorm Automation Kit (DAK)</h2>\n<p>There's so much more that can be done to extend and improve this system!

As avid music listeners, we want to hear what our friends hear. But what if you could stream along with them live? The solution is Overhear.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Overhear which puts you right at the center of social music. Share exactly what you listen to while you listen to it. Overhear captures your computer's audio and streams it live.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Overhear all of our biggest technical challenge yet. It is built using a backend server written in Go, an audio-capturing webserver in Python, and a front-end as an Electron app. Overhear was created in less than 36 hours at HackRice.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>In our initial architecture, audio was captured into chunks and sent immediately over the websocket. We were able to succeed in sending high quality audio, but loud pops persisted where chunks ended. We ended up spending time to buffer and connect the chunks before sending them over the socket, which helped immensely with audio quality. Additionally, after sending the raw data, playing it as a WAV was seemingly impossible. We had to research the WAV standard and, on the fly, add headers to the WAV files before playing.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are all incredibly proud of Overhear because it's something we all plan to use. We took a real-world problem that we and others were having and, from top to bottom, designed and implemented a solution for it. Two of the three members had not used Go before, and none of us had much experience with websockets. Even with these technical shortcomings, we were able to improvise and learn the new tech stack as we developed. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We now have a lot of respect for the engineers at Spotify. Streaming audio is no joke; attempting to play a stream seamlessly is also incredibly difficult. We are now all familiar with Go and far more familiar with websockets, to the point that we plan to use both for future hacks. We primarily work on back end projects, but Overhear is hefty on the front-end; we are proud that we designed and implemented a cross-platform design so quickly.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Overhear</h2>\n<p>Overhear is not a hackathon project that dies after the judging ends. Rather, we plan to use and improve Overhear as we, the users, find improvements and better uses.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets\">websockets</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">electron</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">material</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Wayfarer", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wayfarer \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/408/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Get Yo Wayfarers On!</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wayfarer \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/400/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Landing Page</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wayfarer \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/395/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Sample Listings Will Be Displayed on Search</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Wayfarer \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/396/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>The Personality Indexes at work</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We've always been loyal users of TripAdvisor, Expedia, Yelp among others when we go traveling to place we have no idea about.

This is what led to the creation of Your Ideal Trip. </p>\n<h2>What it does:</h2>\n<p>The website generates a list off activities based off your interests by allowing you to check everything you are interested and what city you are in.

At the same time on the front-end many of us encountered problems with learning how HTML and CSS function.

We wanted to lower the barrier of entry for Virtual Reality story telling and application creation.\n<em><strong>StoryVR</strong></em> lowers the learning curve for making your own VR content and utilizes WebVR to do that. Anybody without any programming knowledge can go to StoryVR and just write a imaginary scene in natural language, and StoryVR will instantly create a Virtual Reality scene in WebVR right in your browser which can be experienced using Google Cardboard,Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. Practically any device which can show content from a web browser. Our good old mobile phones are enough to experience and immerse into our own creation in Virtual Reality.</p>\n<p>What's more!\nStoryVR supports speech recognition and Live Input. So you can essentially <strong>go into a virtual reality scene and live edit it by narrating your story to StoryVR and it will keep changing the scene live while you are in it!</strong> <em>Inception all over again</em></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>StoryVR is a web application which creates dynamically generated Virtual Reality Scenes, worlds and content for it's users. It utilizes WebVR which makes the Virtual Reality scenes it creates cross platform and ready for any kind of device which can run a web browser decently. You can drag and drop your images to be included in the scenes too. In addition it supports Augmented Reality mode(only if you have a camera).</p>\n<h3>Workflow</h3>\n<h4>W/O Log In</h4>\n<p>The user goes to the website and writes his imagination using natural language. The natural language processor of watson picks it up and understands what you are trying to do. The web app connects your intent to visualization and starts creating your virtual world for you in a live preview pane. Once you are done writing, your virtual world is finished too. It being live makes it easier to do incremental and rapid changes to your world too! The user has option to write his story or narrate it too! StoryVR listens and understands you!</p>\n<h4>With Log In</h4>\n<p>The user creates his scene. But along with previous options, also has option too save the stories or what we call worlds. He can later visit them. Edit them or remix them to something new!\nThey can also share the world. A handy share button creates a premalink to that Virtual Reality scene which can be opened in any standalone device and can be shared anywhere. Also can be embedded in any web page using iframe</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The backbone of the web application is aframe from Mozilla and threejs. Which makes rendering of webVR applications possible. Amazon EC2 takes care of the hosting of resources and asset uploads since according to specs Google Chrome and other won't support non https and CORS disabled resources in webvr. EC2 is the only host I found where I could easily enable it, Though our micro isntace makes it slow sometimes. IBM watson does an excellent job at making StoryVR understand what the user actually wants and gives us insight which we convert to actionable content for VR creation. The web app itself was created in nodejs and uses monodb as db (as if I could pull of anything in any other decent language...). The editior is a form of codemirror (which i got from github).\nMy most favorite part is the login/registration part. Which essentially only creates a token for registration, bypassing the need to collect and store personal information.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Everything. From finding out concept tagging in alchemy was deprecated and trying to use the one ported to watson. Trying our hands on npm first and dealing with the dependency hell as well realizing each version change can break your app. Trying to get EC2 servers to use CORS header, trying to install mogodb in Ubuntu 16 and realizing their key signing for Ubuntu 16 is broken. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We finally could get the app running. It runs in web and mobile (mostly). It works pretty awesome considering users are writing in a normal way and not following a format or giving commands.

At this time, 45.1% of all Americans are taking one or more medications.  With each new medication, the possibility of negative interactions between the drugs increases.  Current clinical trials does not take into account all the medications a person can consume.  Medifact aims to remedy this by giving the power to the user to check if their combination of medications is statistically safe.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Medifact takes into consideration the statistical probability of having an untoward reaction to a single medication and takes the statistical probability of the combination of medications and checks if the prescribed medication combination can make you ill. If it does, Medifact recommends you see your doctor and consider switching prescriptions.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>First, we came up with an algorithm for deciding how dangerous each combination of drugs will be based on the  reported untoward occurrences. After we finished the front-end with Jade, we worked on implementing the algorithm onto the Node.js server with MongoDB. We then deployed it to Amazon Web Service EC2 and linked it to our domain sponsored by domain.com.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The data of untoward effects of medications on a population, interactions of medications that do not affect the same pathway, and the ratio of medications prescribed is not public.  We had to extrapolate data from the information provided on the Internet about the untoward effects.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact we are able to segment and analyze the effects of the medication on the population and we wrote a simple, well-defined algorithm that should be flexible enough to implement with real data.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The algorithm needs to be fine-tuned a bit to take into account that these medication reactions are not happening on the same pathway. Along with developing the application for statistical analysis, we learned how to utilize a server and launch the application on the web.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Medifact</h2>\n<p>We need to integrate real medication data, fine tune the algorithm, take into account medication ratios, analyze known drug interactions and extrapolate possible medication interactions, and continue to improve the user experience.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://medifact-sponsored-by-domain.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://medifact-sponsored-by-domain.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>medifact-sponsored-by-domain.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/parkjs814/Medifact\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/parkjs814/Medifact\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on statistical analysis and on the pitch and presentation.

This project was created to help that not matter.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>It corrects words that are typed in the wrong place on the keyboard. For instance, if the word \"hello\" is typed too far to the left, it becomes \"gwkki\". Our application recognizes this, and corrects the word to \"hello\". Our application does not correct words that are not in the hunspell library.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the hunspell library to check spelling of shifted words. In order to make the project more generic, we import a keyboard json file that specifies the relationships between keys. We provide a single layout, <code>qwerty.json</code>.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>When we introduced shifting each hand independently, the program slowed down quite a lot. In an effort to alleviate some word correction errors, we slowed the program down even further. In order to fix this, we moved back to the single-shift policy.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>It works lmao</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Don't call hunspell too often. Don't compare strings for similarity too often. Sometimes, multiple correct words can occur from shifting a set of characters, in these cases, we cannot accurately and quickly determine which one to use.</p>\n<h2>What's next for keyfix</h2>\n<p>Keyfix can be updated to account for more incorrect hand placements. If we are doing this in the future  I think we would have to implement some sort of AI. This is because when getting the possible list of words there might be 2 or more words that appear correct,the AI would help in that decision.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hunspell</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ifyoudieincanada/keyfix/tree/shift-together\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ifyoudieincanada/keyfix/tree/shift-together\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I came up with the idea and helped Riley work through problems in the code.

We wanted to make the process easier and more streamlined, as well as add a social-connectivity component to help connect students that have common likes. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>After creating an account connected to your email, phone, and (if you want) Facebook, you can create and join \"Flocks\" - groups of students that are headed from one place to another. You can share rides to the airport or just to get to another city for 1/4th the price, or you can use Flock to meet and connect with students that you share common interests with - be it late-night boba runs at KungFu Tea or all-day excursions to Galveston. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote Flock for iOS, Android, and Web. The backend database is Firebase, Google's free database. The iOS app was written in vanilla Swift 3, the Android app in Java on Android-Studio using Android libraries as well as some from GitHub, and the Web App was written in Python backend with REST and HTML/CSS frontend. The site is registered through domain.com and hosted on AWS. All three implementations used the Firebase API, although the Web App was challenging due to lack of Python support. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Before settling on Firebase, we had extensive debate regarding how best to store our data in the backend, trying out AWS first before running into issues with SQL. We ended up pivoting to Firebase because David had used Firebase before and it had strong support for mobile development. </p>\n<p>Being a team of five we divided the three platforms among ourselves, which meant that we were spread thin in terms of resources (our iOS and Android apps only had one person working on them). We also had some trouble setting up the backend with our Web App, due to an extreme lack of Python-friendly resources with Firebase. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're most proud of our cross-platform integration, with iOS, Android, and Web Apps all communicating very well, and reading/writing to the same backend database in the same style consistently. \nWe're also proud of the cohesive design philosophy that we employed, making sure to talk through each platform-level design decision with all team members, and documenting our best practices in a shared document.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the importance of establishing and maintaining a cohesive code style across platforms in ensure performance and reliability, especially when dealing with a backend that had to be accessed by multiple, sometimes unsupported, languages. We also learned the pain of dealing with ASync processes when trying to access a backend with sometimes significant performance (ping/lag) woes. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Flock</h2>\n<p>Wrapping up Web App development and polishing up the mobile apps. Specifically, we want to add more social-media integration. Currently our Facebook login only works for iOS, so that's something we would target first. After that we'd look to implement a chatting feature to allow groups to coordinate more readily, or export that function to a group-messaging service such as GroupMe. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android\">android</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rest</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator\">adobe-illustrator</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/vagonz98/FlockApp\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/vagonz98/FlockApp\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the Android app and general programming philosophy.

The more effective this spacing is, the better our studying habits. The spacing effect is going to help enormously, and boost productivity. We began thinking of the easier ways to bring the spacing method of memorization and enhanced learning through students: a chat bot.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Remember All is the simple solution to allow the spacing study method to be executed at its simplest way. We completely simplified the spacing model. We built a solution that was made using python and hosted on a server to serve as a messenger bot.

We suggest an alternative which doesn't steal your time and attention: letting websites borrow the processor in your pocket. Ferris is a distributed computation platform which runs in your web browser to effortlessly connect users together to crowdsource solutions to a hard, concurrent task, benefiting users, site owners, and society as a whole.</p>\n<p>Although existing platforms to \u201cshare cycles,\u201d like Folding@Home, exist, they typically use large amounts of resources for extended periods of time, which \u201ctypical\u201d users often deem unacceptable. Furthermore, they demand more commitment than just opening a webpage. Our solution is far less inconvenient for the typical user, and requires no effort whatsoever on the part of a casual website visitor.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Ferris server, as part of a website, maps a computation over an iterable structure. Clients load a tiny Javascript stub (with only a single script tag!) which fetches work intermittently from the website, performs a task, and returns the result to the server. We imagine that with little contributions from visitors to a popular website, even the most computationally demanding of problems could melt away.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here\u2019s what to expect as a website user:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You load a webpage with the Ferris client stub,</p>\n<p>You advance an important social cause or aid the website creator by donating a few spare CPU cycles. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here\u2019s what to expect as a website administrator:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You identify a useful computation over an iterable structure,</p>\n<p>You create a javascript function which operates on each element of this structure,</p>\n<p>You apply Ferris, let website visitors perform the work, and reap the rewards.</p>\n<p>The possibilities are endless -- advance cancer research, assist routine website maintenance, help with a tricky numerical optimization problem, or do anything you can imagine, just by leaving a browser tab open.</p>\n<h2>Demo task: Protein contact maps</h2>\n<p>At present, our demonstration task sends each client a peptide sequence from the human genome <a href=\"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the NIH\u2019s RefSeq database</a>, and requests that they compute a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_contact_map\" rel=\"nofollow\">protein contact map</a>, a common task in examining proteins. We use the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509512\" rel=\"nofollow\">well-renowned BLOSUM62 scoring matrix</a> to determine the feasibility of matching any two amino acid residues.</p>\n<p>This example, consisting of a computation of nearly 100,000 human proteins, is but a narrow subset of what you can accomplish with Ferris, and we're excited to push the limits.</p>\n<p>Want to see for yourself? Contribute some cycles at <a href=\"https://ferris.ninja\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ferris.ninja</a> or see what other users like you have computed at <a href=\"https://ferris.ninja/visualize\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ferris.ninja/visualize</a> !</p>\n<h2>What's next for Ferris?</h2>\n<p>Our platform can be made faster and more efficient. With the upcoming WebCL standard, we expect to be able to get more \u201cbang for our buck\u201d from web browsers. In the meantime, it would be entirely possible to represent many useful computations in OpenGL shaders and return an image encoding the computational results, in old-school GPGPU style.</p>\n<p>We look forward to making more tasks for Ferris to run. Ideally, we would love to distribute analysis of DNA microarray data, contribute to cancer research, or maybe just crawl the web.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ambition</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">dedication</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://ferris.ninja/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ferris.ninja/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ferris.ninja</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/numinit/ferris\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/numinit/ferris\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ferris.ninja/visualize\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ferris.ninja/visualize\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ferris.ninja</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Co-conspirator; wrote the frontend and backend with Andrew", ""]], ["Owl's Eye View", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>The beginning of the semester is always tough; finding that one document that has all the building codes on it, figuring out where it is on Rice's map... we're trying to fix that.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Facebook messenger bot!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook\">facebook</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">regex</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://owlseyeview.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://owlseyeview.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>owlseyeview.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mgn1/Rice-U-Guide-Bot\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mgn1/Rice-U-Guide-Bot\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked mainly on the Directions portion, which required parsing the user's input through a lot of regex to figure out which location on campus they most likely were asking to get to.

That's where HMR comes in play.  </p>\n<p>A Happy Medium is Rare, or HMR, is a one-stop-shop social web application that takes preferences from a group of users and recommends restaurants.

MeteorJS was used to create the web app, and there was an effort to construct a recommender engine based on Yelp API data. </p>\n<p>Parsing the huge amount of data provided by Yelp (not even analyzing it, just parsing it!) took a surprising and admittedly disheartening amount of effort. The data was so expansive that we could not hold it in memory and were forced to come up with workarounds. The real challenge however, I would say, was being tasked with building a recommendation system based on gigabytes of user data with 0 machine learning background. Every twenty minutes or so, we would realize there was another technology we needed to accomplish our goal, google it, flop it in the project, and move on. </p>\n<p>Going into the project equipped with minimal knowledge on machine learning or recommendation systems or life in general made this a daunting task to say the least. Fortunately, Lucas came in clutch as a MeteorJS guru, and the rest of us were able to focus on the big-data back-end.  </p>\n<p>I'm proud of the entire team for not shying away from a challenging project.

So what are the reasons for developing this app?  Well first is, it's free and will always be!\nTo provide another main reason, let me write about an example.  Suppose, a person wants to teach a course in her/his neighborhood and there are students in that area, not very fortunate to afford formal education, but curious enough to learn about that course, so these students could easily enroll for that course with just few clicks!  And it would also be easy for the instructor to keep tracks of her/his students.\nAnyone from anywhere can start a course and anyone can join that course.  Obviously the instructors could add multiple courses on the catalog and students could take any number of courses they want.\nSo definitely designing a reliable database was one of the challenges.  Since there are many properties associated with a course, and there will be many courses, and also those courses would be taken by many students.  Therefore, to keep the track of these numbers which keep growing rapidly, fast and better data handling are required.  And this was the initial hurdle for this project.  But on continuously working on that problem I was able to come up with an efficient model.  </p>\n<p>Sometimes when it comes to large database implementation, many applications start losing flexibility.  However, in this app, the flexibility is maintained by giving the choice to its users to either login through their usernames or their registered emails. </p>\n<p>Since there would also be personal information of users stored on this application, so the question of security naturally comes in.  To answer that, the passwords are securely encrypted and in case a user forgets her/his password then she/he can easily reset the password by getting a verification code in her/his mailbox instantly.</p>\n<p>Since this is an educational app, so people may want to post educational materials on the app.  This could be the next challenge for this project.\nI have hosted this application on my private Linux based Apache server.  As Linux O.S. are well known in terms of their power, so to come up with the challenge stated above, this could be achieved by FTP (File Transfer Protocol) which Linux are well known for, but more on that later.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to conclude by quoting one of the greatest poets' view on education:  \"There is no wealth like education, the more you spend it the more you earn it!\"  And this app is all about connecting students and instructors with ease and free of cost!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/phpmyadmin\">phpmyadmin</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/linux\">linux</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/apache\">apache</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Buy My Junk", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buy My Junk \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/792/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Making a Listing</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buy My Junk \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/793/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>A Listing example</i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Buy My Junk \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/426/794/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i>Random Generated Listing</i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>After using sites like Craiglist and the facebook page UT buy sell trade we were annoyed on how they were set up.

Then we will address the challenges we are tackling, this is where the various prompts we are addressing can be inputted. We should be able to address questions such as why are the existing solutions not working or insufficient. Afterwards we can briefly go over the various scenarios where our application is directly applicable: sports, alcohol anonymous, family relationships, long distance relationships, support groups, etc. The important thing to note here is that Sandals is a simple solution to a set of complex challenges. Finally, we want to go over real world application, things we want to expand upon and our vision for its implementation. \n    Additionally, we want to briefly go over how we built out application and the most important aspects/logic behind it. We can end by opening the floor to questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong>\n    Sandals is an API that allows users to create profiles and connect on a real time basis. Sandals will give users a targeted communication tool, opening a news feed to real time statuses and moods. Users create and join groups that will allow users to keep in touch in a way that is less intrusive than text but more supportive than open ended social networks. </p>\n<p><strong>Challenges:</strong>\nIf you were to study your Facebook friends and organize them by how you know them, workplace or college or family friends, you would quickly see groups forming.\nSandals gives you the chance to communicate with those groups with an updating status and mood. Current ways of targeted communication are inefficient. People are easily lost in the flow of conversation in any group chat. Yet on the other end of the spectrum, social media platforms with profiles do not adequately address an individual\u2019s desire to express oneself because these social media outlets are open to a wider audience and are susceptible to criticism to more sensitive topics. </p>\n<p><strong>Application:</strong>\nSandals is a simple solution for a number of complex social challenges in the world today. </p>\n<p>\u2022 Alcohol Anonymous \u2013 Sandals offers a platform where groups can monitor one another\u2019s mental health and keep each other accountable without being overly intrusive. No more information is given than the user is willing to give. However, victims of poor mental health commonly exhibit signs of such and most often desire help but lack an obvious means to get it. </p>\n<p>\u2022 Family \u2013 Families can easily keep in touch. Whether it is parents watching for the moods and updates of their children in college or wary children taking caution of their parents\u2019 moods, Sandals offers families a new way to keep in touch.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Sports \u2013 Sports fans now have a way to keep in touch with one another\u2019s reactions at every moment of the big game. Users can express their anger at Kevin Durant moving to the Warriors, sadness or joy at the Bronco\u2019s defeat to the Chargers, or excitement as they wait for the start of their favorite Olympic event.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Long Distance Relationships \u2013 Long distance relationships are difficult to say the least. According to Statistics Brain in a 2016 study 40% of long distance relationship relationships don\u2019t work out. It\u2019s a challenge in itself to fully understand the feelings of one\u2019s partner. Adding on the challenge of distance can be overwhelming and make this challenge even more demanding. Sandals offers a different path of communication that allows those in a relationship to communicate with each other in a new way. Through moods and brief status updates throughout the day, one doesn\u2019t need to read between the lines. There is no need to have to directly tell your partner how you\u2019re feeling constantly and you shouldn\u2019t have to miss out on what they\u2019re thinking or feeling.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Support Groups \u2013 Discrimination is still an abhorrent issue that affects us today. Sandals gives people a platform to form support groups that can offer a safe network and group of people to connect. Groups of people that may have formally felt isolated and ostracized can now express themselves freely with Sandals.  </p>\n<h2>Here's the Devpost Story:</h2>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Here are the questions / challenges we ask on a daily basis, or just in general:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is it hard to be updated with everyone\u2019s current thoughts. </li>\n<li>How are my friends doing?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Making the most out of different social groups.

Azure has a bug that prevents it from hosting the site, but GitHub pages is able to host it. Devpost won't let me type the real domain name anywhere.\nAlso, in order to prevent malicious users from creating Unicode domains that look virtually identical to ASCII domains, most browsers won't show the Unicode character in the URL bar.

Using Google Maps API, we created a web application where people can search for free food around them and share free food events with others. We believe this app can be beneficial in many ways; it will reduce food waste, increase attendance at free food events, and feed hungry students! </p>\n<p>Quick Tutorial \nHomepage shows a Google Map with markers. These represent free food events around the user. Clicking on a marker leads to an info box displaying more info about the event and food there.</p>\n<p>To share a new free food event - go to drag and drop the marker on Google Map to specify your precise location. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meteor-js\">meteor.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://ricefoodradar.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ricefoodradar.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ricefoodradar.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/richardyc/rice-free-food\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/richardyc/rice-free-food\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on Front-End design, meteorjs and bootstrap integration, and Google API.", ""]], ["TrollingCard.com", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/187517216?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;title=0#t=\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Catfacts+glitterbombs=automated meme postcards</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Takes your money, sends a monthly meme postcard to victim by snail mail</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We're a diverse team of creaters, dreamers, and memers.

When viewed from the perspective of the advertising industry, this change in attention span amounts to a waste of millions of dollars of lost revenue. Advertising plays a fundamental role in the dissemination of information for nearly every corporation and the overloading of advertising has served to the determent of all companies involved. \nIn order to match with the present trends of the people,today's information spreading methods need to become more individualistic and less in the form of generic background noise the average consumer. In order to do so, we thought about improving something that everyone sees everyday, the digital billboard. Through the utility of the Watson API which is basically something which detects the type of things you're interested in based on you're appearance, age and gender in order to spread information that is relevant to individuals as well as supplementation by Google's Vision API, our billboards are able to further tailor and select advertising which is more impacful in their daily lives and thus help people gain knowledge about products they are more likely interested in. </p>\n<h2>What is Watson Advertisements</h2>\n<p>Watson Advertisement is an enhancement on the existing billboard by presenting relevant advertisements to people that are eyecatching providing a greater hit on the amount of the advertising which actually leads to an actionable result. The advertisement technique involved is using a camera which takes pictures of the area in front of the billboard at set intervals of time and uses the Watson API in order to categorize certain aspects of the visible and then change the billboard information into a relevant topic for a particular demographic. \nWatson advertisement only displays information that is relevant to the people that are standing in front of it and does not displays anything that is not relevant to the set of people around it. \nFurthermore, if a person is interested in a project, it is seen that the person looks at that particular advertisement for about 10 seconds and this billboard just need 8 seconds to know whether the person is interested or not based on whether if the person is present in the consecutive picture of the surrounding. If the person is present, then the billboard will display a video which is relevant to the image that was displayed earlier so as to slowly gather the attention of people.</p>\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n<p>A major problem what we faced was decreasing the latency from the stream into the Watson API as the camera must take pictures at certain intervals of time while being subject to a constantly changing view. The addition of latency makes it difficult to have responsive and immediate feedback to the viewer and cuts into the already short attention span. Our solution to this problem was to create a cloud server that could give lesser latency as well as subvert a technical limitation of the Nest Cameras inability to connect to Enterprise or Captive network through a laptop wifi passthrough. </p>\n<h2>What's next?</h2>\n<p>In order to make this a fully refined product, we would focus on using any USB camera in order to take the input that is able to distinguish in between the objects, have minimal latency, and hence can enable the Watson API to analyse images at a really fast rate and based on that display a more responsive which is suitable based on the type of people present around it. Advertisements to be displayed also have the potential of being downloaded directly from advertising partners who can update them at their own discretion. \nThese billboards can be used in order to ensure that the company can push it's product to the consumer who are actually in need of it and the advertising done by the company becomes much more resourceful than it usually is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nest\">nest</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure\">azure</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">vision</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio\">visual-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">wifi</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/karunchillz/HackRice2016\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/karunchillz/HackRice2016\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I reverse engineered the stream protocol used by the Nest camera,  which I then used to rip still frames which were then analysed by Watson ", "I helped in integrating the NEST camera with the server and worked on the algorithm in order to know which advertisement to show based on the camera input based on outputs given by the Watson and Google Vision API.", "I created the backend server which will get input from the NEST camera and output the advertisement onto billboards.
