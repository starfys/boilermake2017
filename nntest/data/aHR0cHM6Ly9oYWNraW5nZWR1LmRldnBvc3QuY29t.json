Hiring a tutor gives you a plethora of other problems to worry about like sending emails, making sure you hire a tutor worth the money, finding a place to study, finding someone cheap, etc.. Among the many tutoring services out there, only a few stand out like Khan Academy or Princeton Review However, among all of there, not one company really meets the needs of college students. Most students enjoy and learn more during an in-person tutoring session. Scholarly solves that problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Scholarly gives you on-demand tutoring anytime and anywhere with a nearby tutor. Sets appointments, rate tutors, chat, screenshare in real time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Scholarly is an Android App built with Java, Parse, XML, and Moxtra API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Integrating Moxtra into our app was very difficult for us. Also Building a real time, two way channel for tutors and clients to communicate and keep each other updated. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very excited for Moxtra integration as it makes Scholarly ten times more valuable for people far away. Creating an efficient index searching query. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Real time databases, Moxtra API, User Profiles, Android Material Design, Search Queries</p>\n<h2>What's next for Swift Tutor</h2>\n<p>We will build an iOS App and launch at universities this winter.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/moxtra\">moxtra</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql\">sql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/genymotion\">genymotion</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on front end, back end, and core framework of the app", "I worked on the Moxtra api and the initial front end and login system"]], ["Hack Chair.js", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack Chair.js \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/310/564/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack Chair.js \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/310/565/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack Chair.js \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/566/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Hack Chair.js \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/606/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Students spend a lot of time in chairs. There are many chairs, at home and at school. But not many people know about chairs. Chairs are everywhere but no one notices them!!?!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The Hack Chair.js is an analytical tool that is built off of a chair. It uses an iPhone's gyroscope to detect how far back a chair is leaned. It also uses the camera in a very creative manner to detect how good a student's posture is when sitting on a chair. </p>\n<p>The arm of the chair contains a camera that allows teachers and other students to collaborate. Anyone can see what is on everyone's desks as they work together. </p>\n<p>The muse on the head is used to check how sleepy a student is based on their eye movements and how the chair is positioned.</p>\n<p>Everything is wrapped together in a Javascript Library that anyone can use to take analytics of their chair.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built Hack Chair.js out of a metal chair that was in the auditorium. The phone holder is made out of the nachos containers from one of the snack tables. The arm is made of the cardboard Classic Chips Mix box. Everything is held together with Duct Tape.</p>\n<p>There are two iPhone apps in order to make the Hack Chair work. The phone on the back of the chair runs a camera that detects posture based on how dark the photo is. The gyroscopic accelerations are used to calculate how much the chair is leaned back.

In a matter of seconds, one can emerge in other worlds, vast landscapes, surreal environments, and even inside of a human cell. Our team decided to create this project for HackingEDU in order to showcase the power of Virtual Reality to immerse and educate users at the same time. VR has the power to inspire joy, captivate audiences, and blend the wall between fiction and reality. We sought to use this capability for a greater purpose, and developed for education, hoping to encourage a love for learning while simultaneously granting a truly unique and enjoyable experience. And thus, <strong>Cell VR was created!</strong></p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Cell VR offers the chance to deeply explore and interact within a human cell. Your job is to connect different resources inside a cell in order to simulate how an actual cell may work. Simply drag glucose into mitochondria in order to create ATP, which can then be thrown into the nucleus for mRNA in return. The list goes on, and through Cell VR, one can both learn about the cell and experience a unique and innovative educational game.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Cell VR was built using the Oculus Rift, the Sixense Razer Hydras, the Unity Game Engine, and Autodesk Maya for 3D modeling. In fact - all models were made by the team, and no external models were used. The Oculus Rift was our VR hardware, and the Razer Hydras were our chosen input mechanism, and they allow easy grabbing and moving of cell parts. The Unity Game Engine is our teams favorite engine, and the one we use the most often.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Our greatest challenge was deciding whether or not we were qualified- or knowledgeable enough- to teach Biology. We had to do the required research and make sure that we were getting our facts correct, since this is an educational project. When it comes to using hardware like the Razer Hydras and the Oculus Rift, it's hard to divide work efficiently. What one person builds for the project may not work on someone else's computer, simply because VR plugins are not supported. As a result, collaboration involves quite a bit of messy GitHub interaction and file transferring that often resulted in frustration.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Our team was able to successfully make a full educational game in 36 hours, and felt accomplished that we created something that may truly make a difference. Virtual Reality has incredible amounts of potential outside the gaming industry, and we believe that we can set standards in a field that has hardly been developed. We were able to make the first step in making a difference.</p>\n<p>We also discovered that there is such a thing as caffeinated cereal. I'm pretty proud of that.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>User interaction is extremely important, and we discovered that it's important to consider how someone else may interact with our game. Should we add instructions? Should the user pull or grab objects? It's sometimes hard to consider what might happen in the game before we demo it to the public, but we learned a lot about differing perspectives, even among each other.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cell VR</h2>\n<p>We hope to create different kinds of cells, such as liver cells, muscle cells, and maybe even plant cells that the user can explore and interact with.</p>\n<p><em>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.connor-a-smith.com/cell-vr\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.connor-a-smith.com/cell-vr</a></em></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus\">oculus</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity\">unity</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">razer-hydra</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maya\">maya</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.connor-a-smith.com/cell-vr\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.connor-a-smith.com/cell-vr\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.connor-a-smith.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the C# scripts dealing with Cell Input and Output.

More often than not, our hearing-impaired peers are left in the dark and require \nschool-appointed translators to guide them through the lecture. Since most professors commonly project their\nlecture slides and other supplementary materials on screens, it only make sense to provide their words as well.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The professor talks into the mic. As he talks, the students can glance at their phones to see a live transcript of what the professor is saying.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The professor talks into the mic, which then relays data to the arduino. The arduino makes a .wav file out of the data and sends it to the server. The server leverages IBM Watson's Speech-to-text API to convert the wav into a string. In this prototype phase, we just append the string to a file on the server. The server then serves the file contents to the ios device.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Bluemix NA went down, which meant we had to deploy to Europe. We also had to learn how to deploy using bluemix. We also had to pick up the Watson Speech-to-text API, which was not too hard. Ankur ran into some problems on iOS involving Transport Layer Security due to the new TLS rules on iOS 9, but he overcame that. We ran into a lot of problems on the hardware end. First, we had a huge amount of problems connecting the onboard wifi chip to the wifi due to how spotty the wifi was. We had to set up a hotspot and connect the arduino to the hotspot instead of the hackathon's wifi. We ran into a lot of mic problems, so we had to replace our mic. We then had a bunch of problems loading the software we needed onto the arduino board.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>On the software end, we were able to pull together a bunch of technologies and leverage them well. On the hardware end, we were met with a lot of problems and challenges that took a lot of time and effort to figure out, but in the end we solved a lot of them!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a lot about leveraging technologies like IBM Watson, as well as learned a bunch about different hardware problems and how to deal with them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">usb</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/ankur-gos/projectile\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/ankur-gos/projectile\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Enabled Arduino/Mic recording within the Linux OS within the Intel Edison.", "I coded all of the backend as well as the iOS App.", "Worked with Justin on preparing the arduino for uploading compatible audio to Ankur.", "I worked alongside my teammate to convert raw PCM data into a readable .wav stream on IBM Bluemix.

When we shop at Target, most of us have played the game of who can guess the closest total price of the purchase. It's a fun idea that we wanted kids to have access to and keep them occupied while the parents do some grocery shopping. Currently, our problems involve addition and multiplication. As players progress, we increase the quantity of total items as well as quantity of individual items.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Target Products</h2>\n<p>We used the Target API to get product name, price, image URL, and product detail Target URL and stored it in our PostgreSQL database. At first we were using SQLAlchemy to query that data to display in our UI. However, we wanted to test out Cluster Point (one of the sponsors of the hackathon) so we imported our data to a Cluster Point account and we are not making an API call each time we display a math problem.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Challenges</h2>\n<p>We had so many ideas and features we wanted to add to this game! \nSince Shopping Cart Math is inspired by the guessing game at checkout, we really wanted to have interactions between users. We wanted to use websockets to bring that to a multiplayer level if we had more time at the hackathon! We also had an idea to make the game run on a time limit so that the user is forced to calculate on their feet. We hope to implement these ideas in our Version 2.0.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\"></a>Version 2.0</h2>\n<p>In addition to the above ideas, we plan to expand this project to incorporate subtraction and division. We also plan to introduce algebra/variable problems such as \"If I have $60, what combination of x and y items can I buy?\". \nWe also wanted to display a step-by-step walkthrough of the answer so that the player can identify what they did wrong and learn from their mistakes.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h2><a rel=\"nofollow\"></a>About The Developers</h2>\n<p><strong>Lauren Ortencio</strong> | <a href=\"https://github.com/laurenor\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenortencio\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p><strong>Paola Socorro</strong> | <a href=\"https://github.com/PaolaSocorro\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/paolasocorro\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n<p><strong>Susan Chin</strong> | <a href=\"https://github.com/susancodes\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/susanschin\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a> | <a href=\"http://susancodes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Personal</a></p>\n<p><strong>Andrew Nguyen</strong> | <a href=\"https://github.com/andrewn2118\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> | <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-nguyen/bb/aa0/207\" rel=\"nofollow\">LinkedIn</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlalchemy\">sqlalchemy</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/laurenor/shopping-cart-math\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/laurenor/shopping-cart-math\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://shoppingcartmath.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://shoppingcartmath.herokuapp.com/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>shoppingcartmath.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://shoppingcartmath.mybluemix.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://shoppingcartmath.mybluemix.net/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>shoppingcartmath.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Fullstack: Database implementation, API calls, Javascript to process and display data on UI", "backend, fullstack", "Frontend, UI/UX design + development, concept", ""]], ["DailEQs", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"DailEQs \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/310/668/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Category</h2>\n<p>Coolest pebble hack!</p>\n<h2>What it Does</h2>\n<p>DailEQs is a Pebble math game that helps users increase their mental agility. Practice your arithmetic conveniently and on the go with these daily equations.</p>\n<h2>Why should I put DailEQs on my Pebble?</h2>\n<p>Had I been using an application like DailEQs on my smartphone for the past month, the amount of careless arithmetic mistakes that I'm going to make on my next math midterm would have been drastically smaller.</p>\n<p>The fact that Pebble applications are somewhat limited in complexity compared to other smart devices is more of a blessing than a curse. Not only is the battery life great in comparison, but the amount of distractions that come with smart phones is diminished. This makes the Pebble an ideal platform for easy to access study tools.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We came to HackingEDU with a one main goal, to study for our Discrete Math midterm.</p>\n<p>We ended up learning a lot about the Pebble SDK, Pebble JS, and C.</p>\n<p>As with most math courses, calculators will not be allowed during our Discrete Math exam. Most students would agree that the availability of calculators while doing homework is a crutch when it comes to test preparation. Practicing arithmetic daily on your pebble is a great way to improve your test taking abilities and confidence.</p>\n<p>We decided on the drive up from UCSC that we would make a Pebble App. Our team member Sean owns a Pebble Time and it was an opportunity for us all to learn something completely new. Originally we set out to make an Alarm application that made you solve a math problem to snooze.

So have I.</p>\n<p>As an exchange student from Norway, I experienced this the hard way during my first weeks at San Jose State University. And in fact, I still do, even here at the hackathon. With so many new people and names every day, it feels impossible to remember all of them. Not remembering someone's name can be awkward both for the one who's forgotten and the one who forgets. But in my experience, it almost never have anything to do with the person not being important or interesting or anything like that. It's just really hard to remember.</p>\n<p>Few things are as important as socializing, and especially in school is friends and school mates really important. Both academically, and just in general. Remembering someone's name can be the difference of saying hi when you see that guy you met last week in the hallways, rather than avoiding him to avoid an awkwards situation. It might be the difference between asking that girl you met that one time about the homework due tomorrow, or not. Since it's a lot easier to say \"Hey, Emily!\" rather then \"Hey, you...\".</p>\n<p>Ok. Maybe I'm being a little overdramatic here, but I have smooth solution anyway!

There were several pages dedicated just to ads about college counseling services, ans we noticed many trends: these services prided themselveson costing \"just three thousand dollars\", offered \"unparalleled advice\", and was run by professionals. We decided to put that to the test by automating the entire college counseling process and removing the need for unnecessarily costly sessions.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our web application initally gathers personal, acadmeic, and extracurricular information from the student, including the college the student aims to attend. We then use a college database we compiled to compare their statistics to that of the school. Using numerical values generated as a function of the user input, we suggest other colleges the applicant might be interested in attending. We then formulate a timeline that we suggest the student follow in order to become a competitive applicant for their desired colleges.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>College Database - We created a JavaScript spider which accessed every single college listed on USNews and World Report's College Databases. JavaScript spider gathers key information stored into a separate text file stored online for our project. All our information was then stored onto a BlueMix Cloudant NoSQL database for future access. BlueMix's huge storage allowed for large amounts of data and quick access.</p>\n<p>Algorithm - We used algorithms that used user input to give a standard numerical value from 1 - 100 on three categories: extracurriculars, academics, and testing. Since colleges had different criteria for admittance, we knew it was important to create a universal scale in which all colleges are rated. For extracurricular score, for example, key words and phrases were used to create logarithmic growth functions that increased slower as they grew.</p>\n<p>Web Application - By using a combination of intelligent algortihms, college databases and an intuitive UIUX, we were able to create a useful and good-looking application that planned out the future a high school student should strive for in order to achieve competence in their respective college applications. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Because college decisions seem to take into account many aspects of a student's life, we had to boil the multiple factors down into what would be most important for a college. We had to weight scores differently based on the college's consideration of various factors like different weighting about grades, extracurriculars, and testing. Agreeing on a weighting system for extracurriculars, academics, and testing was the hardest, and we discussed the topic for over half an hour.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We messaged our friends late at night to ask them what they felt was the most important part of college applications, and we learned a lot about what makes our classmates unique, whether it's from what their future dream college is to what they feel should be most important when considering an applicant. I'm happy I reached out of my comfort zone and gained many new perspectives I wouldn't have otherwise. I was also able to create algorithms that made sense while still being detailed enough to accurately rate student's abilities and potentials.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the importance of teamwork. Algorithm-writing and advice-planning would do no good without someone to code segments of it, and no one would look at a website that didn't look awesome. We all helped each other create an amazing product that can give those who can't afford it advice to achieve their dream.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Schola</h2>\n<p>With some more, updates, we hope to release it to the public! After updating to give it more accurate predictions, Schola will be good to go and bring advice to hose who need it but can't afford it. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/namecheap\">namecheap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/godaddy\">godaddy</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pjscrape</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.club</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.daschola.club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.daschola.club/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.daschola.club</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created logarithm-based algorithms in the backend to assign numerical values to academics, extracurriculars, and testing.

My original team never made it to HackerEDU - but I met two Canadian students at this event and came up with a strong, student reviewed idea that enhances learning in the classroom. They are software engineers currently working on the backend.</p>\n<p>Put simply, Query allows students to post questions or comments incited from lecture to a web app through a simple text message. Students and individuals who have fears of asking \"stupid questions,\" language issues, or simple lack of time to contribute to the learning environment have the opportunity to store these questions for the professor/lecturer to cover during a different part of class or office hours. While this gets students more involved in large classrooms and lecture halls, we believe that this web app is a useful feedback tool with expandable features. Data collected from students and individuals can assist lecturers gauge the sentiment in the classroom as well as how well material was retained. It can be used to improve future lectures and styles of teaching. This integration of student knowledge with digital tech enables students to interact more with peers and professors while getting the most out of their classroom education. </p>\n<p>Learning has always been inspired by the active participation of all individuals. Inputs made to Query are voted on: The questions that accumulate in our app can be voted on for significance and importance to learning. Whether the raised comment or concern is something the lecturer should clarify, re-iterate, or remember for a following lecturer, participants can get a sense of what questions are being asked by peers and colleagues. Our app is dynamic and has the potential to be applied in large academic, professional, and political venues. </p>\n<p>Me: As a new \"coder\" at my first hackathon, I've worked on the landing page, pitch, and the written portions of the project.

Smartphones and laptop aren't easily available to those struggling in developing countries, so for those who wish to learn, it is a struggle for them to get online resources that are so widely available to the first world. For example, according to <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/2015/03/19/1-communications-technology-in-emerging-and-developing-nations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pew Research</a>, in Indonesia, only 15% of people own smartphones however 78% own a mobile phone that has sms capabilites. By providing a toll free number that can provide resources to practice basic knowledge (such as math), it will help those struggle in need to get the education to bring them out of poverty.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>The user can subscribe to the database to receive the definition of word of the day daily from which they can guess the word and they can text 'learn math' or 'learn spanish' for easy to hard math and Spanish questions depending of their point count. Points are earned from responding with correct answer and level increases every 10 correctly answered questions.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Team Twilio</strong> ~Hui Shi Li and Nguyet Duong. \nHuishi primarily worked with SQLite to create a database recognized subscribed users. She also works with the Wordnik API to retrieve the word of the day, and its definition. She is the primary lead to access the subscriber's database (subscribers.db). Nguyet worked on the input SMSs, and sending out the appropriate SMSs by parsing the input into tokens. Nguyet also set up and manages the server for live interactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Database</strong> ~Joyce Scalettar and Sarah Borland\nworked with SQLite to create tables to keep track of questions/answers for each subject level and accounts. To do this they created 2 main programs, database. py and Account_Management.py. Text2Learn db is created in database.py (described more below), referenced in Account_Management.py (described more below), and contains tables for each difficulty level for each subject. Account db is created, referenced and maintained within Account_Management.py.</p>\n<p><strong>Team Website</strong> ~Rosalba Rodriguez \nworked with HTML/CSS onto of Bootstrap to build the team's informational website. She customized the page to best fit the product.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Some issues we ran into were, although we got the layout of the code generally correct initially, issues were syntax errors that came from no foreknowledge of python and the SQLite library.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, setting up the server was definitely difficult and we had to do a lot of research to see how we can host the server in such a way that Twilio can still access it. Using Twilio's API was also slightly difficult, as they have many different forms of ways to send message. It caused a lot of confusion among the team members because we did not realize the variation in ways we can receive and send SMSs.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p><strong>database.py</strong> ~ Using the SQLite library to create a database by reading in a text file with questions and answers for several topic with different levels of difficulty and output a table for easy difficulty topic within each topic in the Text2Learn database. Text file can have as many tables as you'd like and any number of questions/answers per table.</p>\n<p><strong>Account_Management.py</strong> ~ Creating a program that contains several methods bridge between the Twilio server and our two SQLite databases. Functions include subscribe (adds user into in account db), unsubscribe (removes user from account db), send question (sends random question from topic and user's difficulty level in Text2Learn db), receive problem (checks if answer is correct compared to Text2Learn db and gives points if correct), and check points (sends user their current point totals in account db)</p>\n<p><strong>server.py</strong> ~ Getting the server up was definitely difficult, and we ran into a lot of trouble and merge conflicts along the way. But in the end, we learned how to use Flask in order to create a server such that we can generate code to send to devices all around the world. There were definitely a lot of bugs, and it was hard to debug in real time application but we made it!</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We gained a deeper knowledge of Python, SQLite, and learned the necessity for the abstraction barrier.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Text2Learn</h2>\n<p>Right now our services are only available in the US, but we would like to be able to get access to numbers in other countries so that more people have access to practicing these topics where internet is less available. We also want to include other languages and features later on as well as concepts in computer science. Also, we want to incorporate mini-lessons about each of the subjects we have. </p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://mimiduong.me/Text2Learn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Check out the website!</a></h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wordnik\">wordnik</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ngrok</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NguyetDuong/Text2Learn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NguyetDuong/Text2Learn\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked with Joyce to create the sql databases that contain the user accounts/information as well as the database that contains all the question and answers for each subject that scale in difficulty.

We then teach them how to protect against the attack and have them fix the site so they can see first hand how the protection works.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We are using Bluemix to run instaces of web sites and apps which have security vulnerabilities for students to attack. The site iteself is also running on the Bluemix service.</p>\n<p>The site is built using Meteor.js framework.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Getting Meteor deployed to Bluemix.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Multiple instances of the vulnerable application running in Bluemix so that users have a pool of servers to work with.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>How to launch and host multiple different types of apps through Bluemix</p>\n<h2>What's next for Get With The Club</h2>\n<p>We didn't get to the second part of the lesson, which is to show the student how to prevent the attack.</p>\n<p>Adding more tutorials for different types of security vulnerabilities.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul

by rounding off purchases to the next dollar and donating them to the charity of your choice, while logging said data to later be claimed in tax deductibles. We gamify the process by adding achievements in badge form that are earned when certain amounts are donated over time to show the value of what you're donating to. For example: vaccinations for children, clean water in villages or even puppy sanctuaries. </p>\n<h2>// How we built it</h2>\n<p>We designed it in node.js because we wanted the fastest environment to produce products. Using Capital One's API Nessie, we were able to simulate financial transactions that would appear on our account to demonstrate the use case of our application.</p>\n<h2>// Challenge(s) we ran into</h2>\n<p>Thinking of ways to gamify the process.</p>\n<h2>// Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>That it can help raise funding for groups that make a difference.</p>\n<h2>// What we learned</h2>\n<p>We actually conducted some data analysis on college students' purchase trends: daily, weekly, monthly and annually. In correspondence to repeated purchases. To see the amount that could be donated by say one individual, a group, a class, an event as large as this one or even a large user case. The numbers add up really fast and we want to show that for a small part on the user's side they can contribute to a much large difference. </p>\n<h2>// What's next for Change</h2>\n<p>We can log user data on their purchases and the charities they donate to for analytic purposes. We can integrate a variety of API's to enable functions such as webhooks. As users continue to grow we can have the various charities demonstrate the initiatives being taken with the donations they've received.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">capital-one-api</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">nessie</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://spare-forthwall1.c9.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://spare-forthwall1.c9.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>spare-forthwall1.c9.io</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Innovation Lead\n", "Frontend+ Assisted Backend", "Data Retrieval and Analysis.", "Primary designer"]], ["De Mobo Classroom", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxL9i3CpVHg?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"De Mobo Classroom \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/311/349/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"De Mobo Classroom \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/311/350/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"De Mobo Classroom \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/647/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"De Mobo Classroom \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/648/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"De Mobo Classroom \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/662/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Even though there is tremendous value in recording and sharing traditional small scale K-12 lectures, this isn\u2019t done because of the high technological complexity and cost.

We wanted to mix and match tracks, to play around with all types of music and let our creative instincts take us where they may, but we didn't want to go through the arduous process of finding the necessary equipment. The most relatable role in modern society would be a DJ, but getting all the necessary equipment and then of course learning how to efficiently use that equipment would take up unnecessary time. Thus, to solve this problem in our lives, we made MyoMusic: an easy way to DJ.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our software allows any person with the acclaimed Myo band to play around with music and create. Using the many different gestures and tracking features Myo offers, we essentially \"assigned\" a gesture/orientation to a certain sound. Users can load up any song they desire, and with the correct motions, play around with the music to create new and exciting tracks. And instead of simply letting users modify music, they can also go through the experience of spinning  mixer (which gets data from Myo and updates its position accordingly).</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Node.js to build our backend system, more specifically the <a href=\"https://github.com/guo-yu/player\" rel=\"nofollow\">Player</a> module to handle the audio of our system, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/thalmiclabs/myo.js/blob/master/docs.md\" rel=\"nofollow\">Myo.js</a> for access to the valuable information Myo provides. We connect that to a user-facing front-end with <a href=\"http://socket.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">socket.io</a>, where the user can see a virtual mixer being spun as they do in it in real life. To create the effect of the mixer spinning and the necessary animations, we made use of the <a href=\"http://threejs.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">threejs</a> Javascript library.</p>\n<p>Challenges we ran into\nCouple of problems with the unique method the Player module work, as well as the overlapping audio files playing to create the effect of DJ'ing. We also had some trouble learning and implementing threejs features as we were all fairly new to the library.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a whole lot about audio API's, data visualization (of Myo data), and of course the Myo band itself.</p>\n<h2>What's next for MyoMusic</h2>\n<p>Hopefully we have a sustainable platform in a month :)</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/three-js\">three.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io\">socket.io</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kNelakonda/MyoMusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/kNelakonda/MyoMusic\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["plsfind.me", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"plsfind.me \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/537/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"plsfind.me \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/536/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"plsfind.me \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/538/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>As freshmen in college, all three of us faced the difficulty of making new friends in large lectures. Classes with two hundred and three hundred people (and 1400 people in an introductory CS class) are intimidating. Finding study partners in these large classes takes more courage than one would admit. We decided to solve this problem with simplicity and elegance. By building a directory of the class, students can network and create study groups at their own leisure with speed; the class is at their fingertips.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>plsfind.me is a website where students can add themselves to classes and quick and easily search through the database for students in the same class.

We also learned how to deploy a Django project to Heroku, and the importance of testing locally (it's much more efficient).</p>\n<h2>What's next for plsfind.me</h2>\n<p>We plan to publish this site, and start implementing changes and more features which would help students in large lectures connect and learn from each other.

This is about my story about early education and the inspiration for our hackathon project, Smilestones.</p>\n<p>I needed social interaction for my son Zaire, since he was an only child, so I took him to the 7-8 month Baby &amp; Me classes at Gymboree: he could get social interaction with other kids and play. Being there kind of exposed me to other kids since I wasn't an experienced parent. What stood out to me was when all these kids started standing and walking in class in a couple months. And there were all these praises around the room like, \"WOW Julian is standing!\" and \"Brock is walking! Good job!\" My kid, at the same age was still a crawler and was the last one to learn at 13 months!! Apparently, my kid was a late bloomer at walking. Some of the parents there were really involved with their kids and were not really first time parents. They were already at a head start with their kids learning. I remember when I was on a lunch date with one of those Gymboree moms, and she started showing me that her kid less than 13 months could point to his body parts. For example she'd be like \"Daniel point to your nose\": he would point to his nose. \"Daniel, pat your tummy\": and he would pat his tummy. And that was a shocker for me. Daniel couldn't even talk yet! I wasn't expecting my kid could possibly do that at that age. </p>\n<p>So that led me to go home and start teaching Zaire that day because I didn't want to be that parent that had a slow child. And I didn't want Zaire to start off slow at school either. So I practiced with him to point to his ear and point to his nose. And that became a daily exercise for a week or two until he got it. I was so happy. I didn't know a kid could grasp that in 2 weeks and retain it. So that's what got me to reading resources on the web and go out buying books to teach him and get him to watch and practice nonverbal communications with baby sign language from Baby Einstein DVD's. So around 16 months of age he was fully engaged and got used to my teaching style: he got used to focusing and later around 16 months old trying to learn things on his own like phonics. Around that time one day we were driving in the car and I heard him in the back babyseat saying \"W...W...W... Wahlmahrt!\" I looked in the mirror and realized he read his first word at 16 months old.</p>\n<p>As a first time parent, if I never went to Gymboree... I could have been that parent that just stays at home and just take my kid to the zoo on the weekends. I never would've known his capabilities compared to other kids his age and whether he was behind or not on his milestones. I didn't know those resources existed and never looked into it, had not been those veteran parents at Gymboree who had teenagers already. I met other young first time moms who were at that predicament myself, at that age with Zaire. I couldn't go to one spot to get everything I needed. Not many parents have the time to search multiple resources and vet out techniques and start organizing steps to teach their own kids, based on their children's age range. Other new parents would ask me where they could look but all I could tell them was to search the web and I didn't really have one set resource they could go to because I had to look everywhere and I just made learning recipes for myself and my kid. </p>\n<h2>About Smilestones</h2>\n<p>It's an unfortunate situation: the future is our children, so why do parents have to dig so deep for information that everyone needs to know and that's not easily accessible?? To help out everybody, we made Smilestones: on Smilestones, you have the parents of today who are sharing what they're doing and what they're learning so the information is constantly updated and parents can review each other's techniques. The resources are constantly updated, so the possibilities are endless at a very early age. </p>\n<p>Many parents are unaware of their child\u2019s capabilities before age 5. From K-12, there are state guidelines that dictate learning standards and where a child should be in their learning. However, there is no standard curriculum for children before they start school. There is no \"best way\" for encouraging child development and learning, and \"good parenting\" is highly subjective. Parents turn to their community, close friends and relatives, to figure out what's best for their child; Still, they won't always have all the answers the parent needs... so they turn to the web for easy-to-find parenting techniques. There are so many different parenting articles, videos, or educational toys, but they're all scattered on the web... and it's difficult to find trustworthy parenting resources. </p>\n<p>As a community, Smilestones parents aggregate all the necessary information for your child to thrive in one place. Smilestones is a community for parents to share, edit, and review techniques for getting kids ready for success. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">target-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/clarle/smilestones-frontend\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/clarle/smilestones-frontend\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Contributed to site content, site's json structure, and some Target API calls.

To involve ourselves in a world of entrepreneurship and tech, we (our team) has to travel to California, surrounding ourselves with the community that inspires us. Thats why we asked, why can't we have that community, all the time, online? Why don't we create a place for us to learn, communicate, and grow surrounded by people with similar endeavors and ambitions.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Project Zilkr is a 9 step curriculum for young entrepreneurs and creators. We also provide mentor chats with Moxtra and are currently working on forum development. Once users finish the curriculum, they can apply for microfunding and mentorship from venture capital who we are already in discussion with and a network of mentors that we have developed. The idea is simple: to move the whole world forward, we need to provide education to young people on an international scale, providing them with an invaluable education in entrepreneurship and creativity.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Our team is fairly new to programming. We have two versions of the platform right now. The first version is a web-based site, run off of html/css/javascript. This site was our build here at HackingEdu. In the last 8 hours, we have worked on turning this website into a Node.js application, but this is still in the works. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Building Project Zilkr without much knowledge of backend was really tough, we spent a good amount of time battling with Mongoose.js and MongoDB. Besides that, the platform required a ton of content for the curriculum.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The whole team is super proud of our work ethic and dedication. We are from Austin, Texas, and we came to HackingEDU to finish Project Zilkr. Along with Project Zilkr, we threw together a MaoBot last night for slack, as a little break. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a bunch of angular and nodejs! </p>\n<h2>What's next for Project Zilkr</h2>\n<p>As \"entrepreneurs\" by trade, we were able to confirm a booth at Websummit in Ireland next week before we even began building the platform.

We learned how important it was to keep it aesthetically pleasing. We also used Github for one of the first times, so keeping local repositories updated with the online ones proved to be a struggle. We also learned how to implement API's and code in Javascript, a language most of us are inept in.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Cheasy</h2>\n<p>Cheasy's next step is to incorporate more supermarket's APIs and show the supermarket at which the needed ingredients are the cheapest. After, it will have options to sort recipes from easiest to make to hardest, or from cheapest to most expensive depending on the wants or needs of the user. Then, we will implement a system that allows users to share ways in which they tweaked recipes. Maybe one user skimped on some ingredients and substituted with cheaper ones, or someone added an ingredient to a recipe and it made it that much better. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/justinmeng/cheasy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/justinmeng/cheasy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], [" Conduction Heat", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>We were inspired by the ingenuity of Michael Tilson Thomas of SF Symphony, so we decided to provide the public an opportunity to experience the pleasure of conducting.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Simulates Conduction of <em>Mary Had a Little Lamb</em></p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We used the leap motion JS API to interpret the hand movement data, and we built our own custom midi player using midi.js and flocking.js.

Even in 2015, a massive portion of the country lives without a smartphone; something that might seem ridiculous to the average person at a hackathon. According to the Pew Research Centre, 40% of Americans still live their daily lives without these devices.</p>\n<p>These people, as a result, miss out on the many things that modern technology offers us. Google Maps, Phone alarms, and instantaneous knowledge are just a few things that smartphones allow us that are inaccessible to many people. However, we saw this unfortunate reality as an opportunity.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Even though only 60% of people own a smartphone, as many as 90% own any kind of phone at all. Eva bridges this gap between the smart phone and the 'dumb' phone, as a personal assistant that works anywhere, with any phone, and without the need for mobile data or wifi. It provides any person with the ability to get directions, translate foreign languages, and even provides information on a person or place with only access to a so-called 'dumb phone'.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Eva is built with node.js, and integrates with many different web APIs, frameworks, and platforms, including Bluemix, Heroku, OpenShift, Twilio, WolframAlpha, Google Maps, and others. It functions as a centralized server which reaches out to different providers of information whenever a user requests it, and forwards that data over sms.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Every new feature was a challenge. Both of our team members had never extensively used any type of Javascript before, and so the entire project served as a learning experience. The use of the many different APIs and services only served to complicate the matter, as no two endpoints were quite alike. However, we did manage to overcome the majority of these obstacles in order to produce a working product.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We both are extremely pleased with the result of our efforts in regards to the merging of so many various APIs into one continuous product. Utilizing such a variety of services meant that every new feature was a completely unique experience that presented its own challenges, unique from the last.</p>\n<h2>What We learned</h2>\n<p>It quickly became abundantly clear to both of us how much more difficult it becomes to work with code when it is both large in size and unfamiliar. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Eva</h2>\n<p>Eva will most likely be developed until stable, and kept online for public use into the foreseeable future.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-directions\">google-directions</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Vroom", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I (Avik) took a chemistry course this summer, which covered the content of a full year of chemistry but fit it into 5 weeks. Many of the students did not like having to commute to a far away school every day for a 3 hour course. Additionally, if a student missed one day of class, they would be weeks behind in terms of content. We created Vroom to improve the student and teacher experience in teaching/taking courses.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Vroom allows users to register as educators or students. Educators can create classes, which students can sign up for. Classes take place in a moderated group-chat environment, where the teacher can display information, explanations, or practice problems.

Introducing Jam Buds, a way to organize jam sessions! Need a bassist for an improv jazz trio? Just create a session and Jam Buds will spread the word for you. Did the drummer call out? Jam Buds can easily get you a sub. With how easy it is to schedule and search for events, your jam sessions will never be lonely again.</p>\n<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>\n<p>Jam Buds was inspired by a need to get students to destress themselves while bringing them together. We had several ideas for what problems we could solve in students' lives, and ultimately settled on Jam Buds, so students who need a break from all the exams and heavy course loads could have a way to express themselves, and more importantly, just relax.Our app design is kept simple and clean, and is user-focused.

It uses the Twilio API to receive texts from the student, and send various problems specified by the teacher back. We used the Clusterpoint Database to store the questions and answers for the problems. Finally, the data of the responses to the problems were analyzed, and then posted to a separate database.

Then, we self-generated some problems, then put them into a CSV file to be imported onto the database. From there, we created a Java program that could communicate with the database and take its data (the questions/answers) down, and send it to the user's phone, using the Twilio API. From there, the user would have the option of answering the question. The user's answer then will be graded.

It's the camaraderie, the us-versus-them mentality that keeps our heads above water. But countless homework parties and office hours have made scheduling collaboration complex at best and impossible at worst. Our frustration at being too busy to attend scheduled collaboration sessions prompted us to create an application that enabled us to find nearby help, fast.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>PleaseTutorMe is a web application that allows users to seek tutoring or seek to tutor others. It uses the Google Maps API and a search bar to match users seeking tutoring to nearby tutors that listed their search queries as topics of expertise. A student can search for a topic (e.g. computer science) and find nearby available tutors that claim to be qualified to tutor in that topic. All interactions are real time; tutors can toggle when they are available and are notified via text using the Twilio API when another user has requested a tutor session with them. Once a tutor accepts the request, the requester is notified and the map UI allows the tutor to come to the requester\u2019s location to begin a tutoring session.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Express and the Node.js framework to create our site. Our frontend was built using HTML/CSS, jade, and javascript, with elements from Bootstrap and Selectize.js (a jQuery plugin). Our data is stored on a Mongo Database.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Using the Selectize.js turned out to require a substantial amount of tinkering, and we almost gave up before we figured out how to properly use it. We also struggled with pulling data from our database and displaying it how we wanted on the maps UI. The various browsers also had drawbacks that made initial testing difficult. Routing took a long time and the search function was tough to implement.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We successfully integrated the Google Maps and Twilio API\u2019s to elegantly supplement the service we offer in our web application. We also created a fuzzy search function that displays only users that can teach certain subjects. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We became more familiar with utilizing API\u2019s in our web applications as well as building elegant UI\u2019s. Our frontend developer used Jade and Node.js for the first time, so he gained tremendous experience with these technologies.</p>\n<h2>What's next for PleaseTutorMe</h2>\n<p>Interactions between tutors and requesters are left open-ended in the current iteration of the project; tutors can request a fee for their time in person, and that negotiation is up to the users. In the future, we\u2019d like to offer tutors the opportunity to publicly display the amount they charge before they are requested or allow them to advertise that they work pro bono. We\u2019d even like to integrate the Braintree API to make payment easier between requesters and tutors who do charge.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jade\">jade</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose\">mongoose</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongolab\">mongolab</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">monk</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/passport\">passport</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://pleasetutor.me:3000\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://pleasetutor.me:3000\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>pleasetutor.me</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/garyliangge/PleaseTutorMe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/garyliangge/PleaseTutorMe\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I did most of the backend and did the integration of the google maps API so that we could display users on the map.

Back in China, when we were high school students, the teachers keep telling us that the subjects, say Math, is very important. But they seldom tell us why we should learn it and how it could benefit our future career. That made us lack of motivation. \nWe hope that we could build something to tell students why these courses are important, how could they lead to advanced studies and great careers, and also tell them the path of learning towards a desired career or achievement.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our WebApp, knowledge labs, have three functionalities. \nFirst, starting from the user(student)\u2019s available skills, it generates a map of knowledge where the student could discover what advanced study, skills and careers could his current courses lead to. \nNext, it could goes backward, starting from a career path that the student want to take in the future, and provide the career\u2019s required skill tree.\nFinally, it provides a detailed view about each career, providing ways to get familiar with it, for example, links to tech blogs, MOOCs and companies. We also have a special section where the student could view a typical day of someone in that career.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>After brainstorming and several discussions about possible user story, we designed the entire storyboard together that we all agree upon. Then, we spilt the workload according our experience level and skills. \nWhile implementing the design, we kept discussing and made the final conclusion on the detailed design. Mostly, we focused on building our own look of our website using front-end languages, and utilize APIs such as IBM BlueMix and Backand to handle the backend services. That strategy saved us a lot of time</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Using multiple APIs, fast development</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>First and most important one is that we have built a visible tree-like system to represent the relationship between courses and possible career. We can expand from one course to others and lead to jobs, or from the otherwise, we start from jobs to list the required skills. Second, we are proud that we utilized several third-party APIs so simplify the work, which enormously improve our efficiency.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>In the last about 36 hours, we as a team encountered several difficulties andlots of new things. We gratefully learned a lot from them and are appreciated that we had such an unforgeable chance.</p>\n<p>We've tried some new APIs for our first time. To simplify our work, we try to use services such as Bluemix and Back&amp;. We are amazed how easy it was to build a web site with the help of the services and some clicks. We tried to import data from CourseHero so that we can get what we want through third-party resource instead of a heavy input by our users.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Knowledge Labs</h2>\n<p>Most importantly, we need to improve our searching algorithms both for searching jobs from selected courses and searching courses from desired jobs; We also need to design and build a more elegant way to  show the relations between the jobs and courses, and also courses and courses;  We would like to encourage user-generated content to make our analysis more reliable.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">coursehero</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">backand</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://knowledgelab1.mybluemix.net/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://knowledgelab1.mybluemix.net/index.html\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>knowledgelab1.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/JefferyChen/knowledgelab\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://bitbucket.org/JefferyChen/knowledgelab\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>bitbucket.org</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on front-end, created the job search page and course selected page.

She is a good student, but she hates reading books. \"Game is more charming than studying\", she sometimes complains, \"I hope to get high scores, so I have to work hard. But...How great it would be if I can play video games with classmates, while still getting a high score on my test!\" \nWhy not? -- Last week, when she was complaining again, that idea hit my head: Why not! Why not make an educational mobile game? My first thought was similar to Habitatics - more like a todo list, that children's avatars and weapons would get upgraded when they finished their tasks.\nAfter talking with Jump and Tony in a Friday party, we got a more exciting idea: Still make it an educational mobile game, while we should add element of \"online battle\" to it. Online battle system and reputation system, if well designed, can considerably encourage K-12 children, like Amily, to use it for an interesting way to learn, and to practice exam questions. Jump, Tony and I were all enthusiastic about the idea. We formed a team quickly and started to contribute to this project. A+ Fighter was born in this context.  - Min Chen</p></li>\n<li><p>I recently read an article: some kids, while playing a game, were able to solve a protein folding problem that had been puzzling scientists for years. That research shows that gaming is one way for children to concentrate, and improve problem-solving skills. When I heard about this hackathon, I knew I wanted to do something similar to the protein folding game. One of our team member, Min, proposed to make an app to keep track of personal goals such as losing weight or getting a good grade.  I thought about her idea and it came to me what if people could challenge each other to improve. A game-education app might create a chance for students who did not study well, to restart, and keep interested in learning. That is how A+Fighter was born. - Tony Trieu</p></li>\n<li><p>I got the Fulbright Scholarship from Thailand to further my study in Computer Science and Educational Technology.

In Flipped classroom model, short video lectures are viewed by students at home before the class session, while in-class time is devoted to exercises, projects,\nor discussions.  But, generally we hear from a lot of our colleagues that because of the material being non-interactive and non-adaptive (to their needs), they were not able to focus properly and hence didn't learn properly.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our application makes Flipped class model more interactive and adaptive to the student's needs by simulating a live class environment. \nFor example: If a student is having difficulty understanding a topic,  he/she student gets the doubts cleared by the professor then and there before professor starts with next topic.\nOr, if the student is distracted or not motivated, the professor asks a quick question to regain student's attention in class.\nThe application will be used by students to watch the material provided by professors. By sensing student's brain activity, the application will understand whether the student is finding a topic complex (and thus stressful) and display option to get clarification. Powered by Wolfram Alpha's API, the application would be able to answer questions typed in simple English. The application will also identify if the student is distracted or not motivated, and will pop-up some question to regain their attention.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We are using Muse headset for sensing student's brain activity and based on calculations identified student's mood with respect to studying. We have also integrated Wolfram Alpha API which enables students to ask their queries in plain-English. The course content is displayed using AngularJS and NodeJS.</p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>The most difficult part of the project was understanding what EEG is and how we can extract the User's stress and stress levels.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Most important thing I learned was how OSC signals are sent from Bluetooth module to the browser over sockets.</p>\n<h2>Future Scope</h2>\n<p>While over the weekend we developed a proof-of-concept while targeting a very narrow scope, we believe\n that the concept itself has a lot of scope in various sectors. For example, the entire system can be applied to job interviews especially for Job that require a sharp and healthy brain.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">muse-io</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">hackerrank-api</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/aakash77/CereBro-HackingEdu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/aakash77/CereBro-HackingEdu\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the hardware part.

Looking at the few modern language translators that took advantage of the capabilities of current day devices, we realized that even they had some flaws. There was no continuation to each app/website, as soon as the text was translated, the app\u2019s purpose was over. We believed that there is more to learning a language than translating it once and forgetting about it, so we created DefineMe.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>DefineMe uses the OCR algorithm in order to allow users to take a picture or import a picture from their phone through our app. After this, the app then takes the user\u2019s picture and converts it to a text file. Then, the user has the option of which language they want to convert their text to. This text is then sent to our backend written in node.js and using the Microsoft Translator API, converts the text into the language of the user\u2019s choice. To complete the process, the translated text is sent back to the user and in order to further support the user, we added a functionality to the app to add the translated text to a user\u2019s Quizlet set, using the Quizlet API. Along with the app, we also have a landing page that gives the user additional info about the app and its features.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We wrote the front end of the landing page in HTML, CSS, and using Bootstrap classes in order to keep the page organized with Bootstrap\u2019s grids. We coded the front-end of the app in Swift, and this includes UI, forms of input, and the OCR algorithm. We then sent this text to a backend and using node.js, we translated the text into the target language, and sent back the text file.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Some of the challenges we ran into while making this project are formatting the landing page properly so that it was aesthetically pleasing, images not being found in both the app and the web, and many logical bugs with the program. One of the hardest bugs to fix was when the Translator API converted the commas separating elements in the array into the target language as well, causing syntax errors when compiled.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the fact that we took two concepts that are used frequently, translating machines and quizlet\u2019s flashcard concept, and combined them into something completely different, in a way that redefines the methods of handling the learning process. We are also proud of the fact that we were able to seperate the front end and backend for collaboration, and after they were finished, pair them together efficiently. We are also proud of the fact to have a landing page that talks about our app in addition to the app itself.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to use bootstrap grids in css to create simple webpages that are easy for the eyes to absorb, yet look elegant and professional. We learned how to call online APIs into our code and use their functions to achieve tasks. We also learned how to format in HTML, using both css and the .html file to make sure all our images were aligned. Another thing we learned is how to test the front-end and backend when not paired, using simple print statements and hosting on the localhost. We also learned how to implement JavaScript code into an HTML file, through the use of typed.js, an additional feature that adds to the aesthetic quality of the website.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Define: Me</h2>\n<p>Although we believe DefineMe has a solid concept that can help millions, we strive for more. We realize that translations don\u2019t only happen from text, they also happen through audio. Because of this, we plan on implementing a audio translation feature, that allows you to speak or play a recording, and the app will then record your voice and write out what your saying to translate it. DefineMe will also have the capability of speaking translated words to the user instead of just displaying the text. In addition, we wish to utilize the leap motion for an improved user navigation through the Quizlet sets they create, for a more convenient learning experience. In order to provide users with more knowledge relating to their language, we wish to use Metacademy\u2019s application code of logistic regression in order to find relatable words to the vocabulary that the user is translating. Examples of this are synonyms and antonyms, which will help vary the user\u2019s vocabulary.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://define-me.github.io/Landing-Page/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://define-me.github.io/Landing-Page/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>define-me.github.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Define-Me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/Define-Me/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on Node.JS backend, small pointers on frontends", "Worked on designing and coding the Swift iOS app and project management.

For a while, I though that bad teaching meant telling people facts while good teaching meant telling people ideas, explanations, justifications, and letting them use those to remember the facts. I still mostly think that, but I also think that if you can discover something yourself, without having someone else tell you, that is the most powerful way to learn.</p>\n<p>Importantly, enabling self discovery is hard, and I think for many lessons interacting with a device (as opposed to consuming a lecture from a speaker, book, or online video) is a necessary part.</p>\n<p>So I took a math concept (combining factors and exponents) and built an experience for students to discover the lesson, not have someone else tell it to them.</p>\n<h2>What I made</h2>\n<p><img alt=\"hands on math\" data-canonical-url=\"http://i.imgur.com/JMq3Doq.gif\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/devpost/image/fetch/s--IqwEoW-b--/http://i.imgur.com/JMq3Doq.gif\"/></p>\n<p>(the round dots in the demo are \"fingers\", since you can't pinch with a mouse)</p>\n<p>I built a native iOS app using Swift that allows the student to discover the rules of how factors combine when they are multiplied together. There are no instructions, no explicit rules. Just some structured behaviors that the student is left to observe and understand. </p>\n<p>The app presents the student with a mathematical expression full of terms and exponents. There is a simplified version beneath it that serves as a kind of end goal. To get there, the student can physically manipulate the expression, through the touch screen, and see how different terms combine and interact through direct manipulation.</p>\n<h2>Challenges and Accomplishments</h2>\n<p>I felt strongly that it was important to accurately model the full interactions and forms that these mathematical expressions can take. So instead of scripting up a skeleton demo without any behind the scenes logic, I built out the data model that almost completely handles the interactions, combinations, substitutions, reorderings and more that can take place with expressions in math.</p>\n<p>A particular highlight is <a href=\"https://github.com/mlipman/HandsOnMath/blob/master/HandsOnMath/ExpressionBrain.swift\" rel=\"nofollow\">this file</a> which represents how the data is modeled.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/mlipman/HandsOnMath\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/mlipman/HandsOnMath\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["GetHelp", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GetHelp \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/231/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"GetHelp \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/232/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges in learning is getting help on homework problems. There are plenty of good online learning resources (youtube, khans academy, course era), but it's not so simple when you want to apply those higher level concepts on specific questions. Teachers are not always free to answer you questions and it's certainly not easy to find the solution process online. The supply and demand are clearly unbalanced - with way more students needing help than the number of teachers we have. So I have an idea for GetHelp - let everyone help you with homework questions.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Essentially, we want to unlock the possibility of getting homework help whenever and whereever you need it. And in order to do this, we want to empower everyone to become a teacher. </p>\n<p>The way I imagine it is lets say Jenny is working on her trig homework at the library and she comes across this unusual question on cosine. She has no clue what to do so she takes out her phone, opens GetHelp, and takes a picture of the problem. Meanwhile, Jack is using the app on his way home. He sees Jenny's problem and wants to help. He writes the solution down on a piece of paper and takes a picture of it with the app. Jenny gets a notification and sees the solution. She is still a bit unclear of the process so she initiated a chat in the app where she can get real-time tutoring from Jack, if he's free to do so.</p>\n<p>The ideal end state of the app would be able to support both real-time tutoring help and off-line crowdsourced way to find solutions. I think both are important in different ways.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We decided to use ReactNative and Parse to build this GetHelp on iphone.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Writing react code for mobile development is surprising really smooth and we ran into way fewer technical problems than we expected. However, Parse has extremely poor support for image upload with ReactNative. Parse also isn't the most intuitive way of thinking about data relations. We spent a good amount of time trying to implement image upload with Parse but ended up giving up because of a lack of feature. Instead, we pivoted and implemented a separate image upload server in Flask.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>At the end, we are able to prototype a functional MVP that proves our concept. </p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>React Native!</p>\n<h2>What's next for GetHelp</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native\">react-native</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/parse\">parse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Inspire Now", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Helping individuals and students reach their full potential.

We as a team are privileged to attend Cupertino High School, one of the best high schools in the area and in the nation. However, all of us have felt or experienced severe student stress either firsthand or secondhandedly.\n This continuous, omnipresent, pressure to excel has caused repetitive student suicides at schools such as Gunn High School. We spent the first three hours of this hackathon researching causes of student stress in high academically achieving areas, and were not so surprised to see that the number one reason students didn't do as well as they could have in school in these areas was due to constant distraction from social media websites/other attractions on the internet. Ladder was born from this knowledge.\n We set our minds and our hearts against this problem and came up with a solution we are truly proud of. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>Yes, it updates over realtime, and yes, we already offer it for web, iOS, and Android, but Ladder is much, much more than your classic planning app. Ladder allows you to organize and keep track of your homework assignments with a beautiful user interface powered by delightful animations - but thats only the surface. Beneath the surface is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm, which we like to call M1. Learn more about how it works in the next section.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another huge factor that sets our application apart from traditional ones is our <strong>companion app for Pebble watch, Scalae.</strong> You can think of Scalae as a <strong>personal trainer for your grades.</strong> She'll make sure you stay on task by vibrating whenever you aren't writing for long enough and will even send you motivational text messages when you seem to be working slowly. In addition to this, all of Scalae's data is integrated with Ladder's and helps power our central machine learning algorithm, M1.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>The heart and soul of our application is our supervised machine learning algorithm, which we like to call M1.  M1 captures the vast amount of data that mobile devices and computers are so adept at capturing these days, such as the amount of time you are writing vs being distracted (using Pebble), the frequency that you need more time than you scheduled for a certain subject, and your grades in each class (just to name a few), and compiles and uses the basic principles of geometry to analyze and find trends between various data points. These trends are later boiled down into meaningful data which is used by M1 to generate a customized homework schedule for you geared towards working efficiency and maximizing your grades. If you're interested, you can view a complete explanation of the logic behind our learning algorithm (http://tinyurl.com/pltxru5)\n\nWe integrated a variety of APIs  and technologies into our project. We built the application using Ionic and AngularJS, which allowed us to test and deploy on iOS, web, and Android. M1 pulled and read all of its data from clusterpoint, which is integrated in Ladder. Twilio is used in both Ladder and Scalae (our Pebble companion app) in order to achieve a more personal connection with the user (ex. sending motivational text messages). We integrated Chegg to show users where to find additional resources if they get stuck on a homework assignment, and we're working on integrating some of the technologies in IBM Bluemix to make M1 more robust. We used CloudPebble to develop our Pebble companion app. \n</code></pre>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code>M1: Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm\n    Writing M1 was definetely the most head-breaking and time-intensive part of Ladder's development. We spent about 5 hours planning it out, 2 of which were wasted in arguing over what would work and what wouldn't. Some of our members had previous experience in machine learning, however, so they guided and lead this aspect of our app.\n\nAPIs:\n      We had trouble dealing with and integrating a lot of the APIs we used, but the hardest one and most time-       intensive one was Twilio. This was because in order to integrate Twilio, we needed to write a server that would carry out the requests that Ladder and Scalae would make. We chose to write this in Node.js, and it is currently deployed on Heroku. We also spent some time working with the Twilio representative at the booth to overcome the credit card restriction, because none of us have credit cards.\n\nPebble\n    We all wanted to create a companion app for Pebble, but none of us had any experience as Pebble developers. We attended two Pebble workshops, however, and managed to pick up a lot about the Javascript SDK. We opted to use the JS SDK to build our Pebble app, and CloudPebble just worked and was amazing to develop with. The only reason this is in the Challenges section is because of the amount of time it took us to get started, which in retrospect may have been due to late-night tiredness.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Other than these, there were no large, looming, problems we faced as developers. <strong>Ionic, Pebble, and Clusterpoint were fun to hack with, and we picked them up fairly well.</strong> </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> Building it. We knew we had a large and ambitious project on our hands when we brainstormed this idea on Friday, but we decided to take a risk and choose it instead of other, easier to finish, ideas. This, in retrospect, was because this was the only idea out of all that we had that we were really passionate about. Its still hard for us to believe that we wrote a learning algorithm of the quality that we did in under 36 hours.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> We learned quite a bit about teamwork throughout the course of this hackathon. We knew we would each have to stay on top of our game if we wanted to even come close to finishing a project as large as ours. We decided to meet and walk and talk as a team every two hours so that we would all know what we were doing, where we were, and whether we were ahead or behind schedule.\n</code></pre>\n<h2>What's next for Ladder</h2>\n<pre class=\"language-nolang\"><code> 1) Making M1 more robust. M1 is the core of our app, but it was only built within 36 hours. Our first step will be to  refine and perfect it. \n\n 2) Finding tutors. We want to roll out a feature which allows students to connect with other students who are doing the same homework at the same time and have better grades (all things which our app takes in already). This would allow a student on one side of the country who is great at math but horrible at writing to engage in a mutually beneficial relationship with a student on the opposite side of the country who is great at writing but horrible at math. We're very excited about this idea and we're eager to begin developing it and putting it into action.\n\n 3)Improving Scalae. As Ladder grows, so should Scalae. We're eager to learn more about the capabilites of the Pebble watch, and make Scalae have a similar UI feel through animations and color as is older sister. \n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clusterpoint\">clusterpoint</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble\">pebble</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch\">sketch</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning\">machine-learning</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/alchemyapi\">alchemyapi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chegg</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ladder.paperplane.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.ladder.paperplane.io/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.ladder.paperplane.io</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ladderedu.herokuapp.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://ladderedu.herokuapp.com\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>ladderedu.herokuapp.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/q5roku5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tinyurl.com/q5roku5\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tinyurl.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I wrote the machine learning algorithm to analyze the grades and create an optimum work schedule.

He thought to himself, \"how cool would it be to text your math problem to a number, and get the answer texted back.\"</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Wolfio introduces a breadth of math-related capabilities to users without an internet connection. The user sends an SMS to our Twilio server, we parse the message, and call our personally made Wolfram API that return results as text expressions, which Twilio sends as an SMS back to the user.</p>\n<h2>How We built it</h2>\n<p>We used a Flask server in conjunction with Twilio's web service that allowed us to send and receive text messages from users. The server was written in Python, and would receive a text caller_id and body. The body would contain a syntactically-correct string that would be parsed by our server, and depending on what mathematical function the user specified, a certain call to a hand-made Wolframcloud API would be made.</p>\n<p>We used Wolfram's Development Platform in order to create our own API using Wolfram's mathematical functions as a base. For the length of this hackathon, we were able to support functions such as derivatives, integrals, multivariable integrals, limits, summations, matrix multiplication, inverting matrices, solving a system of equations, and more\u2014all without internet for the user.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I would say our two biggest challenge lied with 1) getting accustomed to the Wolfram Development Platform language. Luckily, there was a Wolfram sponsor/employee at the hackathon, and he was able to give us great tips on how to customize our Wolfram APIs. Our second biggest challenge was with parsing multi-function input (for instance, calculating the derivative of 5x and then adding that to the indefinite integral of x^2). This required making a Python parser. Our syntax currently revolves around using a function name, followed by a colon, and the user's expressions/parameters wrapped in parentheses. Ex: Derivative:(5x^3, x, 2). This would take the second derivative of 5x^3 with respect to x.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of being able to make a fully functional offline calculator for anyone with a connection to a cell tower. The potential for such a wide-spreading knowledge base and mathematical power is unbelievable. People in developing countries with cell service now have access to a world-class mathematical computational powerhouse. This is just the kind of jumpstart in information accessibility that the world needs.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to make a successful app using Twilio's Flask server, and integrate it (no pun intended) with WolframAlpha's customizable APIs. I got a better feel for how Python is able to parse strings, and return meaningful information. I also am much more comfortable using the Wolfram Development Platform to create custom functions and APIs.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Wolfio</h2>\n<p>The best part about Wolfio is that it can comfortablly scale in its functionality. We only had a short number of hours to create an already sturdy list of mathematical functions. As more time is put into this project, more of WolframAlpha's knowledge base can be made easily accessible to aspiring mathematicians and doers around the world.</p>\n<h2>Syntax</h2>\n<p>(No % included in actual text message)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Derivation: <strong>derivative:(%expression%, %withRespectToVariable%, %nthDerivative%)</strong></li>\n<li>Indefinite Integration: <strong>int:(%expression%, %withRespectToVariable%)</strong></li>\n<li>Definite Integration: <strong>definiteint:(%expression%, %withRespectToVariable%, %min%, %max%)</strong></li>\n<li>Multivariable Integration: <strong>multivariableint:(%expression%, {x, x_min, x_max}, {y, y_min, y_max}, ...)</strong></li>\n<li>Limit: <strong>lim:(%expression%, %withRespectToVariable%, %asVariableApproaches%)</strong></li>\n<li>Sum: <strong>sum:(%expression%, %min%, %max%)</strong></li>\n<li>Matrix Multiplication: <strong>matrixmul:(%maxtrixOne%, %maxtrixTwo%)</strong></li>\n<li>Invert Matrix: <strong>invmatrix:(%maxtrix%)</strong></li>\n<li>Solve System of Equations: <strong>solve:(%equationOne% &amp;&amp; %equationTwo% &amp;&amp; ...)</strong></li>\n<li>Solve Equation for Variable: <strong>solvefor:(%equation%, %variableToSolveFor%)</strong></li>\n<li>Domain of Function: <strong>dom:(%function%, %domainOfVariable%)</strong></li>\n<li>Range of Function: <strong>ran:(%function%, %variableOf%, %rangeOf%)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Icon from Stefan De Haan and Ribbla Team at The Noun Project</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wolfram-technologies\">wolfram-technologies</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/minupalaniappan/Wolfio\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/minupalaniappan/Wolfio\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Handled creation of Wolfram APIs using Wolfram Development Platform, Python string parsing, and helped give the world easier access to knowledge.", "Handled Python side and helped build an awesome mathematics tool.

Learning is always better when you have fun!</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>By using IBM Bluemix as a service provider, I created a simple Rails backend app that serves as a JSON API for  an iOS application. The iOS application was built using RubyMotion, which is an implementation of the Ruby programming language that runs on iOS, Android, and Mac OS X. By using location services (Apple's MapKit) and push notifications provided by Bluemix services, Study.Club provides real time data of study groups (or clubs ;) ) happening near universities. Bluemix is targeted towards universities, but could possibly be expanded to target cities as well.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Team formation. Unfortunately, I started out with a two team mates, but both ended up dropping the idea and leaving for the day. It is 11:40 and I have 10 hours to finish building a fully functional iOS app. It'll be a fun night!</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>Finish the Rails API backend with user authentication and full restful interfaces in a couple of hours made me pretty ecstatic. Also, being able to integrate IBM to manage my Rails application on top the Heroku platform helped me our greatly and boosted my productivity a lot. I couldn't have done without it.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Perseverance is the key to success. It might sound cheesy, but I've given 24 sleepless hours of coding to make this a possibility. I'm not hear to win, but I'm really proud of the progress I have made, and the importance of working together with other people around you to learn and improve your ideas. A lot of the people I talked to and sat next to helped me out with different aspects of the application (front end idea, name brainstorming, etc). It was a great experience and I would defiantly do it again.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Study.Club</h2>\n<p>Even though Study.Club is not available for purchase for cheap (according to Mark, the .Club representative, the domain is worth $50,000), I think Study.Club is an appropriate name for the service since we are getting people to meet and form 'clubs' of people who they can comfortably study and hang around. Although our primary concern is getting people to study more, it is important to promote student networking. It always good to have buddy that can help you out in classes, which makes university more enjoyable. A good parallel to this is this hackathon. By making new friends and working together towards a common goal, a difficult problem can seem simple. Study.Club aims to make students more interested in getting together to study, and making it more accessible around their universities.</p>\n<p>P.S. The repositories and IBM Bluemix domain are named BreakfastClub (our first idea, based on the movie), but we decided to go with Study.Club even though the domain is way out of our price range. Study.Club reflects our ideology better than Breakfast.Club.</p>\n<p>TL:DR; Study.Club rocks! :p</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby\">ruby</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rubygems\">rubygems</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">rubymotion</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku\">heroku</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://mystudy.club\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://mystudy.club\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>mystudy.club</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awernick/breakfast_club\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/awernick/breakfast_club\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awernick/breakfast_club_ios\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/awernick/breakfast_club_ios\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Killing It", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Killing It \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/419/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Killing It \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/426/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>People who are killin' it</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This app is for posting photos with a caption of people who are enjoying life, working hard, and killing it around our community with the purpose of entertainment and acknowledgement of positive actions.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Android Studio for android development.

It is the tendency of many people to skip those words/terms/concepts without trying to understand it. Some apps and web-plugins are used by others to find the meaning of the unfamiliar terms. However, it is very hard for people to remember it for a longer period of time, since it is unlikely that they would see those words/terms again in near future. The less you rehearse/revise what you have learned, the greater the speed with which forgetting takes place. Once you learn a fact, you need to refresh your memory shortly before the newly acquired knowledge evaporates. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Our app provides an easy-to-use and intuitive platform to find the definition of the unknown terms, create a personal database of definitions and concepts, and reinforce the learning by browsing through those definitions repeatedly. We use cards to display the definitions alongside its relevant image in opposite chronological order. The user could browse through the cards to strengthen his/her memory.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We first thoroughly went through the list of APIs, discussed with some of the sponsors about our idea, and funneled down on the basic structure of the application. We started using Back&amp; service to build our backend, but we soon realized it lacks few features needed for our application. Hence, we had to build our backend from scratch using node.js and express.js.\nWe have developed a mobile app as well as webapp. We used Ionic, Angular.js, and Cordova for UI. We organize the words and their definitions in form of deck of cards and store them in the database using MongoDB.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>We started with wikipedia API for dictionary, but we found that they don\u2019t provide API keys and thus block multiple incoming request as a bot attack prevention safety feature.

This is mainly because of them feeling detached from their peers and not having someone to speak with. Having someone to share their thoughts and learn new things will drastically improve every student's mental health. </p>\n<p>Students are also having a hard time finding companions for activities like studying for a test or playing a sport during the time they need. That's why we as a team wanted to build a user friendly, non-intrusive solution to solve this problem during the Hackathon. Pebble is one of the best as well as the least intrusive smartwatches in the market. That's why we chose Pebble as our platform.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Load the PalFinder app on your Pebble smartwatch and choose your interest. Then walk around! If you run into someone with the same interest, the watch vibrates. This helps you meet people with similar interests and encourages face to face interaction.</p>\n<p>We also built a website where your location and interest is plotted as a marker on google maps. This helps you pinpoint another person with a similar interest and walk towards them or form larger groups based on interest. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used the Pebble SDK to develop the app for Pebble Time watch. We programmed it using Javascript on CloudPebble. The app and the website are designed on Sketch and developed using HTML/CSS and jQuery. We utilized Firebase as our backend and utilized Google Maps API to build our Web based map interface. We have also started integrating Twilio's API for real time text messaging to provide location information to the user. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Having designed and build for high resolution, large screen devices; It took us some time to adapt to Pebble's concise display and related UX elements. We wanted to build a companion mobile app but after accessing its usability, we decided to build a powerful standalone app. Testing the app has been a challenge and pebble's proprietary image format took some time to get used to.  </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>We came with 4 different ideas for the Hackathon. We then debated, assessed and decided to work on two projects that we felt are worth pursuing. We are proud of our accomplishments designing, building and validating our projects in just two days. All of us worked on a platform not familiar for us and this helped us to learn new concepts. We had fun doing this.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Designing and programming for Pebble. Working with a diverse team helped us compliment our skill sets. This has also been a great team building exercise.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Pal Finder</h2>\n<p>Enhancing the app features like allowing users to choose multiple interests and a custom radius. Improving the UI/UX of the app. We also plan to integrate various feature rich APIs to offer more features. We want Pal Finder to be an enabling tool for students to easily find companions to do what they like.</p>\n<h2>Demo</h2>\n<p>If you want to try it out, you can find the CloudPebble code at <a href=\"https://github.com/nikintharan/PF\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/nikintharan/PF</a> and the code for the website at <a href=\"https://github.com/soundninja/palfinder\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/soundninja/palfinder</a>.

OpenNotebook is an open source application that allows for actually working on math on your computer, showing step-by-step algebra work as well as creating graphs and diagrams.</p>\n<p>Our hack this weekend was to combine this application with the Moodle course management system to allow for automatic grading of work, augmented by teachers providing partial credit for any questions that students got wrong, because they can now collect the actual work done by the students, not just their final answers.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Students can use the OpenNotebook application to create a document that represents exactly what they would usually write in their notebook. Our hack this weekend added the ability for Moodle to read these files, check the answers of each question against an answer key and generate a \"student summary\" document for teachers. This gives a concise summary of all of the work done incorrectly, teachers can then award partial credit based on student work.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Some modifications were needed to make the OpenNotebook application with with Moodle. On the student side, they were just submitting the documents they would create themselves. On the teacher side we wanted to provide a clean experience, so we wrote some new java code to allow for partial credit and feedback provided for a problem to be saved back to the Moodle site.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Moodle is a large library. It was a bit difficult to see exactly where the enhancements we wanted to add belonged. We ended up focusing more on the java side, as the grading interface is going to be in the client app anyways, we just started moving the automated grading there as well. It just didn't seem to fit into Moodle's model.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I've been wanting to do this hack for a long time, just happy to say I sat down and did

never really thought I would be an engineering major. Now you're probably thinking why I'm in engineering. Well, I will tell you that discipline is key. I strive so hard to get here. After long office hours, hitting the books late at night, and a lot of practice, I was able to make up for a lack of talent in mathematics. I am still not the best but I am not going to give up. As I start my second year as an engineering student, I would like to take this opportunities to thank the hardships and adversities in my life because they trained me to be strong and also give thanks to those who are supporting me through this process. I wanna end this with this quote because it is one of my philosophies \"Take your passion and make it happen.\" I am an engineer and I will make this happen. </p>\n<p>I am dedicated in my studies and I am very eager to finish college. I took out loans and is currently working two jobs that will support me in furthering my education but both are not enough. I believe that I can make a difference in the world and contribute back to society.</p>\n<p>We want to open the application for all students, like me, to a great opportunity. As many of you know, part of your career will be dependent on experience. The more experience you get, the more chances you land a job. I really hope this helps students like me.</p>\n<h2>Development</h2>\n<p>I am very familiar with Telerik and I learned how to manipulate the platform. I had troubles with coding in swift so I had to find another way to make an application without using Xcode. Gladly, everything worked out in the end.</p>\n<h2>Further and Future</h2>\n<p>I want my application to help volunteer students get easy access to the application at my current workplace.

However, learning how to pick up an instrument and making one's own music is no easy task. From watching countless hours of YouTube videos and practicing in your bedroom, it can easily bog down a large chunk of time from an otherwise busy day. On top of that, music is a skill closely interleaved with muscle memory. Spending those long nights practicing an incorrect technique will only pile up added hours down the road where you have to unlearn your mistakes to go down the right path. </p>\n<h2>What is Virtuoso?</h2>\n<p>We built Virtuoso as a data-mining hack directly on top of an acoustic guitar to siphon information of user input in real-time. In a nutshell, it <strong>tracks and analyzes your finger positions and pressure on the guitar</strong> and sends it over to a back-end server. This enables the platform to collect highly valuable data from a live musical performance for all kinds of analysis and provide relevant feedback.</p>\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n<p>We created a basic capacitive sensor to extract user touch and pressure by measuring how long it takes for a piece of conductive material to go from a grounded state to a higher potential when passed through a pull-up resistor. In theory, whenever you touch either a fret or a guitar string(assuming that they are both made out of conductive material), you induce a temporary capacitance. We measure this capacitance to track all tactile input made directly onto the guitar through the arduino board, and send the data over to our back-end django server which analyzes our strokes and rhythms in real time and provides accurate feedback.</p>\n<h2>Use Cases</h2>\n<p>Virtuoso is a data-pooling platform - it simply gathers data in real-time from the acoustic guitar. We can use this information in many applications:</p>\n<p><strong>Learn how to play</strong> - Are you hitting the right notes? Are you pressing hard enough? Too hard, maybe? Is your technique on point, or is it rather sloppy? We can compare your playing habits and finger positions in-between chord transitions with more experienced players to let you know what you're doing differently, and give pointers on possible changes for you to implement.</p>\n<p><strong>Write out sheet music</strong> - With real-time data of your entire performance, it is very easy to translate the data points into a music sheet. </p>\n<p><strong>Master rhythm</strong> - Are you mistiming your strums? Should you be transitioning between certain chords faster? With our data, you can pinpoint specific flaws in your playing habits that can steer you towards being a more experienced player.</p>\n<h2>What's Next</h2>\n<p>We would really love to follow through with this project - loads of room for improvement, especially on that spaghetti board.  Cleaning up the interface is going to be one of the next steps, along with finding an unobtrusive solution to attach it onto the actual guitar.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django\">django</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js\">d3.js</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I shorted a 9V.

When people want to learn something new they have to go through a guess and check process with courses, links and tutorials to see if the content is truly self explanatory. We decided that you should focus on the learning part when trying to learn so we built Thea.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Thea put simply is the teacher you always wanted. You simply enter a subject you want to gain more knowledge about and Thea will return at least the 3 best resources. Users can vote up and down the content provided so the best resources will always be at the top. Its a service for humans by humans</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We needed a solution that was simple and scalable while also being extremely intuitive to use. We spent a lot of time on the user interface to give Thea a fun look compared to dull websites people are used to. Then we curated a database of topics and resources which we thought gave the best learning experience. Learning something is now a click away. </p>\n<h2>Challenges We ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the hardest things about building Thea was getting a database of resources for each topic. We couldn't use a web crawler because we had no idea how the links would turn out. We ended up hand curating the list of data and added a social aspect so users could add the links in which they learn the best.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<p>After we finished the initial search we had some time left so we wanted to add something else. We decided that voice search would be a nice addition. We ended up adding an artificial intelligence engine to our project that figures out what exactly the user needs. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Thea</h2>\n<p>After a whole 36 hours of hacking we are pretty proud of what we have accomplished. However, we still have a long way to go. We now want to establish  a user base to mark our presence in the world. We could also add some animations and effects to make the user experience more enjoyable. We had a lot of fun making Thea.

What we found extremely interesting, was that instead of using the typical tutoring and teaching practices that are used in the classroom, we encountered a totally new way to engage children into learning material. We used Minecraft to teach the basics of coding and all sorts of math from basic addition to binary and algebra. There were children who came in for our classes that were falling way behind in school, and after a week of tutoring were comfortably performing math problems way ahead of their age group. And not only were they understanding the concepts in a short amount of time, but they were eager and excited to learn more! We want to break the norm of school being a place or boredom, textbooks and memorization. The orthodox concept of the classroom setting should be something of the past when there are so many new, modern, and hands of ways of teaching children things like math and coding. Education and having fun shouldn't be mutually excusive things, and we want to encourage a revolution in the classroom to using things like Minecraft, games and hands on technologies to aid in the exploration of the sciences. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A basic keyboard where a user can type out simple assembly instructions</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We built this project using the mechanic known as Redstone in Minecraft.  The way Redstone behaves it is very similar to how electricity and circuits behave. Using knowledge of how logical gates work and exploration of the inner workings of a computer we decided to make this assembler.  We had to build every circuit by hand and together we worked out our own form of ASCII character representation as well as implementing an assembly language.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>We ran into trouble with the implementation of this project in Minecraft because the size of the sheer size of the circuits, often we had to be careful about how far out we built so that it was still in the viewing distance of the player. In addition, having timing elements come together took a lot of trial and error.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are very happy that we were able to create a working assembler, we are happy that we were able to take something we were interested in and place it into an environment that makes it very easy to visualize. It was a great learning experience to try and take something that may be very complicated to, and create it in a way that could be taught and introduced to youth in the classroom.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>We learned about how computers work internally and how information can travel through circuits. Since the propgation of data was at such a slow and understandable pace. We could understand much better how binary logic worked through the simulation of circuitry.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Assembler</h2>\n<p>We hope to keep expanding on the assembler as well as create other projects, making it more viewer friendly and hopefully create a new way teaching complex topics in a way that is more engaging to students.</p>\n<h2>The Instruction Set</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/182VdW4K68rhaEBaskH0cw6V_lRbvhsacYxETyQxdac0/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">minecraft</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I made most of the logic that had to do with managing memory and reading char values into the assembler and deciphering them into the machine code instructions.

We sometimes feel alone, behind, confused or lost. That is why community is so important, and it is often missing or difficult to develop at our schools. This tool enables students to develop a collaborative community by being connected anonymously and randomly for on demand mentoring sessions. Students can request mentoring help from those who have already completed their class, as well as the incentive of extra credit from teachers and scholarships to mentor others who are in classes they have taken.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>A user registers for our app, are paired up for a mentoring session with another student above or below their current experience level. The app maintains anonymity so that students feel safe to ask any question. It incorporates a rating system to allow both users to give feedback, which is then tracked for teachers to view and offer extra credit. We also utilize a donation from the mentee to provide scholarships to students with excellent mentoring reviews.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>We decided to use Moxtra because of its great collaboration abilities - students can chat, whiteboard, share files and screens. We also wanted to incorporate a scholarship incentive so Braintree was perfect for that. Then we used MongoDB, Heroku, Node.js and Boostrap. And of course, an awesome .club domain name to round off that community building.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>This was the first time for most of us to develop a web app, and to attend a hackathon - almost every step was a challenge, learning how to put all the pieces together from front end to back end to APIs, we're pretty much n00bs.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We were able to use this time as a team from the same college to introduce others from our school to their first hackathon as well, seeing what it's like to form a team, develop an idea, and overcome obstacles in accomplishing your goal. \nI am personally proud that so many of the club members were able to attend.

A much more natural way of language acquisition was the experience of having a conversation with a real native speaker. To try to bridge the gap without creating an intimidating environment, we wanted to help people speak with a new language while being able to express their thoughts in their own tongue.</p>\n<p>Linkguist, the bilingual online link for life-long linguists and language lovers alike.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Linkguist creates a chat between two speakers of different languages, and shows both the original message and a translated message. By learning through context, a learner can better associate the two languages and grasp confusing concepts such as grammar, usage, and colloquialisms easier. Native speakers don't learn grammar rules, and we're leveraging Watson's ability to translate these colloquialisms into other's native languages. </p>\n<p>Users go to the homepage and select between being an English speaker and a Spanish speaker. They then are put in a chat with a person that speaks the opposite language. They can start a conversation with the person speaking in their native languages, and translations are also displayed.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Our app was built with the inclusion of two essential APIs: Moxtra and IBM Watson's Translation built on Bluemix. Using a node.js server, we created a chat box through Moxtra. After catching outgoing messages and pushing them through the translation service, we sent both the original and the translated text. This enabled the user to have a seamless chat service in two languages.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>No one on our team had previously implemented an API into a project, so getting Moxtra to work initially, even unextended, was a difficult task. There were many technical difficulties involving IBM Bluemix being under maintenance, preventing pushing of files from local systems to my butt. We wanted to have a very appealing splash page to welcome the user, and creating the front end design proved much more difficult than expected, especially involving image manipulation.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We not only managed to implement both API's successfully, but we have them working in tandem and integrated Watson's translation with our own modifications on Moxtra's chat service. The feeling of success when we were actually able to see the messages translated in front of us was very rewarding. Additionally, we're proud of our beautiful webpage design, and catching branding. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Coming in, none of us had leveraged an API, let alone linked them in series after modifying one of them. All of us are just freshmen, and together, we learned essential backend, networking, frontend and API development concepts that we can definitely use in the future. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Linkguist</h2>\n<p>Currently, Linkguist is a two language service. We want to be able to expand it to a multi-language, multi-platform tool that people can use on any device, and anywhere in the world. Additionally, written word is only half a language. Combining the chat service with Moxtra's Video Chat API, and Watson's Speech-to-Text abilities, we can continue to assist students in their love for languages. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/moxtra\">moxtra</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ajax\">ajax</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I worked on connecting with the Moxtra API to make the chat boxes that our users have their conversations with.

As teens of the 21st century, we find that the classroom environment is built around studying extensive text book material. With the constant distractions of social media and technology, we and many other students are unable to maintain our concentration span during our quotidian readings. As a result, we were inspired to turn the tables by using technology to help accomplish our reading and supplement it with a variety of study resources.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Using the Tesseract API provided by Google, our Android application converts a user inputted image into a String Object. Our application then, through a multi-step algorithm, determines key words and phrases based on repetition in the passage and other criteria. The resulting data is used to compile a short summary of the passage, connection to Quizlet study sets, editable notes, and complementary sources to study.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used Java, XML and JSON to create the backend portion of our application. This includes the use of the Tesseract API for image to text conversion, Chegg API for generating a list of supplementary study material, and the Quizlet API for producing note card sets regarding the passage. The algorithm, written in Java, takes in the converted String and analyses it for the most frequent words and passages. This data reflects the key terms of the passage, and are used to generate the subsequent functions. The summarizing function includes the most important excerpts from the passage based on these key terms. The Quizlet function sends the key terms to Quizlet, generating card sets. The resource function takes the users textbook to find related textbooks based on subject matter, and other characteristics. To create our UI we utilized Adobe Photoshop CC.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first challenge we faced was in creating the algorithm that converts the String to primary terms. When brainstorming ideas for the process we missed a few important details which hindered our ability to affectively determine key terms. This issue forced us to reevaluate our code to accommodate for more edge cases. Another challenge we faced was in finding and understanding each of the three API's we used. Most of the API's we found were incompatible with the languages we used, thus extending the process of finding a reliable API.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we are proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast and fairly accurate OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</li>\n<li>Identification of key terms and phrases</li>\n<li>Creation of relevant study sets on Quizlet</li>\n<li>Ability to find pertinent study materials</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Implementation of OCR</li>\n<li>Utilization of the Chegg API</li>\n<li>Remote creation of Quizlet study sets</li>\n<li>Natural language processing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for Succinct</h2>\n<p>Further improve accuracy of OCR and algorithmic processing, by developing machine learning.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tesseract\">tesseract</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chegg</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">quizlet</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio\">android-studio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">webster</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/anirudhnkl/Succinct\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/anirudhnkl/Succinct\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on developing the Android application.

Built on a strong foundation formed by collecting data from across the internet, StudyAdvisor identifies correlations between pages based off of the concepts discussed on the different pages. These correlations are fine-tuned in reaction to the actions of users to optimize your research experience with a collection of crowdsourced data and automated tools. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first built a web crawler to automate searches to find top pages distinct subject areas. We then scraped these pages to distill the fundamental concepts discussed therein using the IBM Alchemy API. We proceeded to cross reference the sites with each other to find correlations based on the subjects they discussed. We built a browser extension that improved our dataset by recording users' searching habits, allowing us to provide the most relevant recommendations based on what our users are researching. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Our first problem we ran into was setting up the linode server to run on ubuntu 14.5. After quickly solving that with the help of linode sponsors we ran immediately into another problem with IBM's alchemy api key becoming expired. We made a decisive decision to be much more accurate with our next two keys to make sure we had a functional database. Our last feat to overcome was our Dijkstra algorithm to search for close related concepts to current users sessions.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're proud to have made a resource that can help users world wide find online resources. We are proud to have made a database of over 9000 correlation mappings. Our little child has grown to explore the internet from one little linode. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned how to implement different API's and implement our own api's through flask.

I made a hard-coded version of the gesture detection, and won my first Myo from that hackathon, but it wasn't as robust of an application as I hoped it would be. It didn't pick up gestures and movements, assigning them meanings as elegantly as I anticipated. LearnMotion is the natural successor of my first project. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>LearnMotion allows users to essentially save the data representation of a specific motion on their account, and enables them to access it web and mobile platforms. Users can then compare the original \"perfect\" recording with their real-time practice data. For example, a communications disabled person can use this application to effectively learn and practice American Sign Language gestures by downloading them from the motionStore, and then using the application to pick up the motions when they're performing it live, to send a message. For example a friendly wave would be \"hello\" on a messenger application.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The application essentially records motion data generated from the myo or pebble, saves them on the firebase database, and then the user can view all these perfect recordings on the application. They can choose a perfect recording, and then they can do the motion live, and the application will then give them live feedback based on how similar the the data representations were. We compared two data vectors using the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) machine learning algorithm. The application was built for Android, Web, and iOS platforms, specifically using Node.js, Express, Myo, Pebble, Firebase, and DTW. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>There is the biggest challenge of the idea itself. Will it work at all? Can Recordings from different devices be compared the same on different devices with enough efficiency and speed? Other than that, the web version was relatively easy to make and test and experiment on. The difficult part was the implementation of the firebase, myo and pebble on the mobile iOS platforms and android. We have an incomplete iOS app because it's so difficult to make it work.

Not only does this enhance the experience of online lectures but also enables the hearing impaired to follow along in online or in-person classes by using our web interface. They wouldn't need a translator to have the same experiences as other students.</p>\n<h1>What its built on</h1>\n<p>Visual lecture is built with three main components. The first main component is the java applet that transcodes audio to text. The audio is transcoded by IBM's API Speech-to-Text. Once the audio is transcoded the text is sent to our server hosted on Heroku. The server was built on the Node.js runtime, mainly using the javascript framework Express and the Socket.io node module. Once the server receives the text, the text is then fed to IBM's API alchemy so that we could grab the key concepts of the lecture. These concepts are then used to search for visual aids using Flickr's API and then served back to the client's computer that is getting the transcribed audio in realtime and visual aids to enhance the experience.</p>\n<h1>Challenges we faced</h1>\n<p>The main challenge we faced was integrating all of API's together into one cohesive system. We had to learn to complete a large task under a small time constraint. One of the largest challenges was getting the audio to transcribe in a fast and accurate manner. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Initial endpoint:  <a href=\"https://infinite-brook-7279.herokuapp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://infinite-brook-7279.herokuapp.com/</a></li>\n<li>Speech Text:  /v1/speech</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gradle\">gradle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/maven\">maven</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cheerio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.club</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dvpxl/visuallecture\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dvpxl/visuallecture\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", "", ""]], ["Anemone", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>When my parents immigrated to America, they struggled to learn English.

Wouldn't it be easier to have someone from your class studying for the same test help explain those concepts?  Throughout our college career, there have been many times where we were taking classes that we needed help in, but had no friends that we knew in the same class.  Having a way to reach out to those classmates who are also looking for help through a mobile application can help break the ice between students to form study groups and grow their network. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Study Buddy provides students the opportunity to reach out to nearby students who are looking to get a study buddy or join a study group for their classes.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We first started off by identifying one of the biggest problems we face in college and built an app around that. Once the concept and requirements were laid out along with the most appropriate tools needed to develop them. We decided that the ionic framework was a good option to build a web application that had the key features and UI components needed to develop a high quality project. We utilized each member's strongest skills to develop the project in a timely manner. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges facing the group was familiarizing ourselves with technologies we have not used before. Installing the ionic framework was not straightforward because it was done through command line. Deciding which new APIs to implement also proved to be a challenge due to unclear documentation. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>Seeing the project progress incrementally was an interesting experience. We were able to implement most of our intended features by the deadline and we learned how to better cope with the challenges that arose during the process. Meeting someone new and working with them can also be challenging at times, but we managed to collaborate seamlessly. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned a variety of things during this hackathon. First was our ability to find our solutions quickly using the help of teammates or the internet. Second was our ability to learn and implement new APIs. Lastly, we acquired a better sense of responsibility and taking initiative in a team environment. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Study Buddy</h2>\n<p>The foundation of Study Buddy allows for it to have the potential to establish more than just friendships and study groups.  With additional time to fully develop the application, a rating system would be implemented to endorse the skill set of individuals in study groups.  After receiving a certain number of endorsements, the individual would be eligible to become a tutor for that subject or concept.  This would not only foster the growth of a collaborative environment in which students would work in, but would also provide benefits to those students who master the concepts in their classes.  </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">chegg</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ionic\">ionic</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask\">flask</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facebook-login-api\">facebook-login-api</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps\">google-maps</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlite\">sqlite</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/SethRubin/studybuddy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/SethRubin/studybuddy\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on mostly the front end using Ionic.

We ended up pivoting to something far more impactful, and more close to home for most students: tuition. College burns through savings, and often leaves many with crushing debt; if we could ease that burden even a little bit, if the service expanded, it could collectively save millions. Too many students end up required to take a 5th year of college\u2014<strong>only 19% graduate within four years</strong>, according to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2014%2F12%2F02%2Feducation%2Fmost-college-students-dont-earn-degree-in-4-years-study-finds.html%3F_r%3D0\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York Times</a>. </p>\n<p>If we could design a system to provide students a clear, easy to follow college roadmap, we could give them the framework they need to graduate on time.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>QuarterBot uses a friendly automated chat system to put together a student's college path. We turn a vague major, and a perplexing major requirement chart into an easy to follow optimized quarterly schedule. Our recommendations are designed to evenly spread classes out, allowing for plenty of room for general education requirements, and electives. </p>\n<p>By making the system as fun and intuitive as possible, we're hoping that we convince as many folks as possible to plan ahead, and save.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We used PHP and AJAX to handle requests and do all of our optimization in the backend, and HTML/CSS/JS to present and send user input. By utilizing a super-intuitive UX, we're hiding a ton of the complexities of calendar optimization, turning a mind-numbing and frustrating task into a fun, almost social activity.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We had some issues implementing php, and developing the optimization algorithm. Turns out that those course charts are complex for a very good reason: with so many potential paths for receiving the same degree, there was a lot of work necessary to find the best based on user input.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We're excited to have been able to take such an awful process, and present it in such a not-at-all-awful manner. We had some fantastic team-work at play to put together the massive library of courses necessary, as well as the sorting algorithm for schedule design.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>Nobody on our team (save one!) had previous experience with PHP; at the end of this project, we can all proudly say that we contributed in a meaningful way.

Student A, who is too busy on Mondays, will never be paired with Student B who is most free on Mondays. Rather than wasting time trying to figure out a time that will work best with everyone, students are placed in a team based on a common time.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>On the front-end, we used the classic HTML/CSS combination to create an aesthetically appealing but straightforward form. The form's data is submitted to an ASP, then exported as a .cvs file. Using Python as our back-end language, we parse through this .cvs file and implement Ford-Fulkerson.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>Implementing the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in Python was definitely a monster of a challenge. Creating the graphs was very difficult, because we all had a pretty introductory knowledge of Python. Being efficient was definitely another big struggle. At one point, we had five nested for-loops that also included several if-else branches. It was hilarious, then not, then extremely sad. Still, we had a good laugh, pulled through, worked on our front-end interface, and got our code to a level we could all be proud of as beginner back-end developers.</p>\n<h2>What we've learned</h2>\n<p>The past 36 hours have definitely pushed us as programmers. This being the first Hackathon everyone in this team has participated in, we weren't sure what to even expect, let alone what to <em>code</em>. It took us the majority of the first day (Friday) to even come up with the idea (after messaging our friends and asking them for an app they wish they had), and the majority of the second day to come up with the algorithm to optimize our code. All of Saturday was a mad and stressful rush to get our code up and running.</p>\n<h2>What's next for groupEDU</h2>\n<p>We hope to continue developing groupEDU to be a fully functional web application. The front-end and interface of groupEDU is already solidified. We just have to hone our skills more as Python back-end developers, so we can make our plans and potentials a reality. Eventually, we want to implement groupEDU so it can handle a class of over 500 students efficiently. We would also like to implement additional features/parameters like having an option to choose the \"minimum period of common time\" to be more than an hour.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Teacher Assist", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Lack of a dynamic and helpful assistance/education in 3rd world countries.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Teachers have access to analytical and cumulative tools they can use which helps them tailor the homework to each student to reach their full potential and exercises we provide.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>Ruby on Rails as the back-end and the MaterializeCSS framework for the front-end.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The internet provided and cross platform programming between Linux and Mac.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>The database we implemented and the overall idea.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the availability of online open free courses and that there is a way to customize homework depending on the student. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Teacher Assistant</h2>\n<p>Machine learning and a huge dynamic database which takes in more parameters from the students.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ruby-on-rails\">ruby-on-rails</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio\">twilio</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">materializecss</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/postgresql\">postgresql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clusterpoint\">clusterpoint</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react\">react</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/firetix/HackingEdu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/firetix/HackingEdu\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I worked on the front-end of the website using HTML/CSS and the MaterializeCSS framework.

And than I start to think about how to make a cool project than allow me to make use of these computing devices.</p>\n<p>The idea is to make use of any devices, include phones, tablets, laptops, and even micro-controllers which have BLE capability. This project allows these computing power been utilize by contributing them to a wireless parallel computing platform.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Each device could be a client or server for parallel computing,</p>\n<p>Server, or Host is the device who has algorithms which compile to or written in \"YSInstruction Set\" (The ultra light weight programming language / instruction set created by me during this hackathon. ); </p>\n<p>Client, of cause is the device which is running those algorithms and returning their outputs back to host.</p>\n<p>Each BLE devices which have a service with UUID \"D0839ACE-698E-4728-BA3A-A3616ACE979E\", in this service there are two characteristic, \na program-in write-only characteristic with UUID \"E69AEA26-F70A-4AC0-BA3E-4596DE081FDA\",\nand another read-only notifiable characteristic for returning values, UUID: \"E1C0C6CA-0DE6-4353-A87C-7DCBD4567FAA\"</p>\n<p>during runtime, the host will search for free clients available, once it discovered devices that have the service \"D0839ACE-698E-4728-BA3A-A3616ACE979E\", it will automatically notify to the returning-value characteristic and listen for returning value, than the host will write the program to the program-in characteristic.</p>\n<p>Once the client has handled the functions once, It cached the function in memory, start from the second cycle only params were required inside payload, therefore It can run the same function over and over with different params.</p>\n<p>on the client side, once it received a full instructions (aka program), it will start executing it and return the returning values to the \"returning-value characteristic\" for the host to listen.</p>\n<p>if the host does not get a response in certain amount of time, It's a timeout, the host will stop listen to that client and resend the same data to other client to complete the algorithm.</p>\n<p>Since each client is not really very important for the host, that means the number of clients can be dynamic changed during runtime without giving any problems to the host.</p>\n<p>Since all instructions were converted to local cpu instructions by executor, cpu architecture is not a problem.\nSince the host is \"listening\" to the returning values, unlike common parallel computing, each client can have different spec different clock rate.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>-Start with creating my own lanuage\n-Create an executor for specific platform ,(e.g. swift for iOS/OSX, C for micro controllers\"\n-Programming the host to sent instruction thur ble to test if it work\n-IT WORKS!!!!</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>ultra-light programming language, which ends up a pure binary and hex programming language.</li>\n<li>Managing BLE services and central.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I just made a new super-light weight programming language (a 20byte program contains variable declaration, a for-loop, a couple of if and else if control flow)</li>\n<li>I also made a way to allow micro-controller and other devices can be programmed remotely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Write new language</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What's next for BLE Parallel Computing</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>micro-controller based \"Computing power\" hotspot - a rack of micro controller providing remote computing power to devices nearby.</li>\n<li>Linear algebra libraries and instructions </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3\">c++</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ysinstructionset</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["senseN", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"senseN \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/421/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>It all started with a Google Science Fair project. We were using photoresistors to measure the logarithmic properties of light and we ran into one issue. Connected this photoresistor (and microcontroller) to the Internet in real-time with graphing. Instead we had to settle for using Google Spreadsheets. We were suddenly reminded of this when started doing labs in physics class. Here we were presented with a solution to our problems, LabQuest. While the system worked well, not only did it not support photoresistor, but it was over $300 for just the base! As hackingEDU came up, we set our goal to be to alleviate this problem.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>senseN (pronounced \"sense to the n\") aims to solve two problems. 1) Even though technology has become cheaper and cheaper, access to this cutting edge of technology becomes more and more expensive and often less intuitive. senseN provides a cheaper and more reasonable solution to the sensors required for class room and individual experience. senseN facilitates teachers to simplify the lab process, allowing teachers to set up labs and both students and teachers to quickly download lab info. 2) senseN, unlike the systems that are available today, is able to cater to both the technologically advanced and those that just want a simple interface. senseN allows the user to use an advanced Python SDK on Raspberry Pi that allows them to use the multitude of sensors available off-the-shelf or the user can access a Java and Swift SDK to implement their own apps into the system. <a href=\"http://puu.sh/kX7zE/8989262f48.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Check out this link to see our iOS app connecting to a Java version of Flappy Bird</a>. One the other hand the user can use simple premade hot switch enabled analog and digital sensors on the Raspberry Pi and our iOS app which outputs accelerometer data to a live graph</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p><strong>Raspberry Pi:</strong> We built an abstracted SDK which allows users send data to the web interface, and focus on the data, not getting the data to the web. Here in one line of code we start a live stream of data that is read from an Analog to Digital converter and is hot-switchable\n<code>sensen.report.Run(sensen.sensor.Readadc.port_one, \"%\", \"Analog 1\")</code> <strong>Hardware:</strong> We divided our hardware into Analog and Digital. Using molex connectors we created an easy modular connect system which allows us and user to quickly and easily connect sensor to the Raspberry Pi using a standard 3-pin connector. Using this system we created light, temperature, and force sensor modules, but it can be easily connected to off-the self and custom sensors. <strong>iOS SDK/Application:</strong> We chose iOS for one of our devices because they are many in number and they have advanced sensor built into them. We used Firebase to live stream the iPhone's accelerometer data and make it accessible to our web interface and 3rd party applications. Measuring in Newton's of force we were able to 15 data updates per second. <strong>Web Interface:</strong> When building the web interface, we wanted to make sure that it was easy for non-technical people to use while still providing the capabilities that professionals need. We also wanted to provide a classroom oriented system which would be easy to manage and use for both teachers and students. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The biggest challenge that we ran into was the lack of Internet, but while it made it harder to implement our design we overcame it by dividing our project up into offline tasks</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>We are most proud of the modularity of our service. Although we did not go into the hackathon thinking about creating iOS and Java applications, our server and database was able to handle multiple data inputs so we were able to build on multiple platforms. </p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>The biggest thing we learned was through our experience in creating a multi-platform application. We learned that we had to use SDKs for aiding in the usage of our code across platforms.</p>\n<h2>What's next for senseN</h2>\n<p>The next step for senseN is to add more platforms and sensors. Additionally, we would want to partner with schools to both refine our product and help them. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi\">raspberry-pi</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/requests\">requests</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js\">express.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">gpio</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase\">firebase</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios\">ios</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3\">css3</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">semanticui</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">sensors</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["I helped write the Python back end that processed the sensor data, and pushed it to the cloud ", "", "", ""]], ["Justify ", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Justify  \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/411/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Today, creating change in your community by setting legal precedence is much simpler than what it was even 25 years ago. But, the ability to create this change is still not fully democratized, or at least available in a platform that people who are not either interested in or a part of the profession can understand. With a growing number of problems having to be solved by the common people, a platform needs to exist to give someone the tools to try and set legal precedence without having to be a lawyer.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Justify aims to solve that by providing a simply designed platform to create and collaborate on licenses for works, make and share petitions, as well as write articles for an online legal review that does not belong to a specific academic institution. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Justify is a web app. It was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For forms and saving data, Parse was employed as the database solution. To keep with growing needs for simple UI design, Materialize's CSS package was used to provide icons, typography, and other stylistic elements to achieve a \"material-designesque\" interface. For colloboration on licenses, Moxtra's API was used. To help take these licenses and adapt them for use to protect intellectual property, Bitproof's API is used for notarization. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I did not know much front end javascript before the hackathon. So, much of the project was spent learning many Javascript practices. Additionally, Bitproof's API was definitely a completely different perspective on the idea of a license, and packaging that into an already disparate application was difficult.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>I am proud of designing a simple, neat website, for coming up with a new way to look at patent law, and for being able to dynamically change the site based on changes in the database.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>I learned to go for hackathons when they start, rather than almost 24 hours later, or don't even bother going.

As presidents for the Lynbrook Robotics team, we understood that cultivating a professional relationship between the younger members and the coaches would help provide longevity to the activity we love to participate it, so we wanted to find a solution.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Auxilio, Latin for \"assist,\" is a context-aware writing editing platform that provides feedback to improve writing. There are two modes to our product, \"e-mail\" and \"essay.\" In \"e-mail\" mode, the user enters in his or her text through the Auxilio website and gives dynamic suggestions to add the proper elements of an e-mail or add in logistical information if a meeting is being planned. This mode also checks for colloquial terms by cross referencing an SQL database of slang words and warning the user about these terms. As for the \"essay\" mode, Auxilio provides a unique speech to text function to provide an alternative way to use the product. Additionally, we used Automattic's AfterTheDeadline API to conduct grammar checks on the entered text. This helps make the essay more coherent and elevates the language used in the writing.  </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>We built Auxilio primarily using PHP and CSS. We started the project by setting a vision of what we wanted the website to look like. We then translated this sketch into reality over the next few hours. We built the web app on IBM's BlueMix platform, which allowed us to rapidly test our code. BlueMix also enabled us to use APIs like the built in Speech to Text API and the MySQL server to add robust features to our product. After we established the framework with BlueMix, we explored Automattic's AfterTheDeadline Grammar Checker which allowed us to efficiently filter grammar and spelling mistakes. At the same time, we used HTML and CSS to polish up the product and give it a professional image.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were excited to implement IBM's BlueMix tools to add professionalism and simplicity to our project. However, we were discouraged to find out that IBM had to shut down their North American servers for maintenance. This was a temporary set back, but with the help of Syed, we were able to link our project with the European servers and continue our web app. \nAdditionally, each team member had to learn different aspects of web development on the fly, so we really had to communicate with one another in order to be efficient. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We believe that our biggest accomplishment is that we were able to get a functional product in our very first hackathon. Hacking EDU was founded to provide a opportunity for young students like us access to mentorship and resources we would not have been able to get. \nBesides that, we are also proud of how our web app extends beyond the traditional classroom. Throughout life, school teaches us how to calculate derivatives and analyze works of literature, but fails to give us the foundation for real world education. We believe that by promoting formal writing practices and increased accessibility through Speech to Text, we are in a sense promoting a social good for students to prepare for the next chapter in their lives. \nIn fact, after we finished this question, we ran our answers through Auxilio, and we were very proud to discover that Auxilio identified mistakes in our responses that we did not catch.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned the benefits and drawback of using PHP. We learned how all these languages communicate with one another to create one functional product. Finally, we were able to learn how a hackathon works. Since this was our very first one, it was a great experience to see everyone working in their own teams but also interact to help one another.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Auxilio</h2>\n<p>Beyond just a web app, we want to write a Google Docs and Google Chrome plugins to make our product more accessible. We also want to expand our slang term database as well as refine our grammar checking service.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php\">php</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml\">xml</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql\">mysql</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/curl\">curl</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery\">jquery</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">automattic</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/git\">git</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/github\">github</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://auxilio.mybluemix.net\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://auxilio.mybluemix.net\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>auxilio.mybluemix.net</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/srinjoym/Auxilio\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/srinjoym/Auxilio\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Get Clucky", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<p>Does a lot of cool stuff about chicks in clubs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/wordpress\">wordpress</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html\">html</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", [""]], ["Seal Clubbing Awareness", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Seals.

Teachers use online services to give out assignments, supplement lectures, or perform other activities. While integration of these services improves the efficiency of teaching, there is still one source of inefficiency that is not addressed. If classwork is assigned by a teacher and afterwards discussed upon completion, the teacher must wait until all of the students are done with the assignment. He or she must individually check if each student is done, which wastes a lot of time. There is also an overhead of keeping track of who is done. For ten students, this overhead may be negligible, but for fifty students, it is much more significant. However, if the classwork requires the use of technology, an online service that indicates whether or not these students are done would minimize this wastage of time.</p>\n<p>This scenario can also extend to everyday life. A group of friends planning to have lunch together may need to wait for each other to arrive at the restaurant. Online gamers wait for their friends to prepare to play with them. Organizers of an event need to ensure that everyone is ready before starting.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Toggle.club</h2>\n<p>Toggle.club is a real-time online waiting-list web application that aims to eliminate the time spent checking whether or not other people are done with a task. The user can create a virtual waiting room on Toggle.club's website. People can then join that room and indicate whether they are \"ready\" or not by clicking a single button. The creator of the room can moderate the room by</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"locking\" the room to limit participants</li>\n<li>kicking out unwanted participants</li>\n<li>marking all participants as ready</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The name of Toggle.club came from its main functionality of \"toggling\" status and its objective of being fun and simple.</p>\n<h2>Technical Details</h2>\n<p>Toggle.club is created using Scala, Play Framework, and Akka, with SBT used as a build tool. The project was developed incrementally, with features built on top of each other. The backend was developed first, with the frontend written afterwards. The server is packaged with Docker and deployed to a server running on Linode.</p>\n<h2>Future Plans</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A textual, user-indicated status</li>\n<li>Improved handling of rooms</li>\n<li>Detection of offline users</li>\n<li>Room messages</li>\n<li>Chat integration </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scala\">scala</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">play-framework</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/akka\">akka</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">mithril.js</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">pure-css</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://toggle.club/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://toggle.club/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>toggle.club</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I built this by myself."]], ["TaskChallenging", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Education should comes from two part, \"self-solving and learning\" and \"rewards\"</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>This is website makes this happen that people can post interesting challenge, it can be a math, chemistry question or hackers' problems.

Honestly, we didn't study enough -- we procrastinated. Jon usually writes a series of basic flashcard style questions to test himself before the exam -- it usually works out well. When driving to school, Jon wanted to study. But how could he study <strong>safely</strong> when he needs to read the questions? There he discovered that he could copy and paste his study questions into an Apple note on his iPhone and tell Siri to read it to him! It worked .. kinda. Siri didn't give him enough time to respond to the questions before blurting out the answer. Enter <strong>Flash Talk</strong>. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Flash Talk is a simple application with a simple purpose. To <strong>read what you tell it out loud</strong>. With an intuitive interface perfect for students studying for the big exam (like us), one could finally utilize their driving time/shower time/any-other-time-where-you-can't-sit-and-study. Since it was inspired by flashcards, a variable delay time is provided to give the user time to answer the question before hearing the correct answer. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>There are two elements of the app -- a web app and an iOS mobile app. </p>\n<p>Franklin created this web app by using node.js and koajs in the backend, mongodb for database, and angularjs for frontend. It's an interactive and two-way data binding web app.</p>\n<p>Jon used Xcode and Swift 2 to make Flash Talk on iOS. Since iOS allows for local storage, he did not need any APIs. He used a native speech library and basic data structures to implement the program.</p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p><strong>Development</strong></p>\n<p>Web: (in the words of Frankie)\nDue to the network issue, it's hard to reach the API documentation. It slowed down my progress a bit. The most challenge of this hackathon for me was to build a functional web-app from backend to frontend in one day and half. However, it's lots of fun.</p>\n<p>iOS: (in the words of Jon)</p>\n<p>I can admit that I was a noob in iOS. Most of my time was spent Googling and watching videos to get it done. Storage in iOS took me awhile to understand. Also, I unknowingly added a breakpoint to my code and thought my app was crashing. I really wanted to test the app on my iPhone but the Apple Developer site happened to be experiencing issues (just my luck huh?).</p>\n<p><strong>The Real Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>We originally had a team of 4 set from UNLV (Las Vegas) to attend the HackingEDU. Super psyched about our first hackathon, we went to our computer science department chair to ask for assistance in funding to get to San Mateo. Major flop. Long story short, we got no money. Two of the four backed out. Frankie and Jon -- two noobs, half a team, no money, in the middle of midterms -- felt we had to do this. And here we are. No Ragrets.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We initially planned on just attending all the workshops and and walking out with a bunch of swag. Nope. Seeing the Bay Area developer culture, we were inspired and motivated to do something awesome. Despite it's simplicity, we are very proud to have completed a useful product in less than 48 hours. We never knew we had it in us.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We've got some side projects to start: They don't teach this stuff at school. APIs, cloud services, frameworks -- so much more to learn!</p>\n<p>Confidence: This team of two that our own computer science department wouldn't support had completed a project at our first ever hackathon. We are patting ourselves on the back. </p>\n<p>Outlook: We learned that our dreams are set really high and there's a lot of competition -- but more importantly, we learned that they are within our reach.</p>\n<p>California: It's the land where great developers congregate. Since we landed in San Francisco, we've heard tech lingo all around us. It's such an awesome culture that promotes innovation. </p>\n<h2>What's next for Flash Talk</h2>\n<p>Open-source it and put the iOS app on the App Store! We've got some fine-tuning and integration to do beforehand, though. This thing is going on our resume and will go down as the proudest achievement of our undergrad career!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/angular-js\">angular.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">koajs</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb\">mongodb</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson\">ibm-watson</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap\">bootstrap</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/alphaXkiller/hackingEdu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/alphaXkiller/hackingEdu\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jonajonlee/flashtalk_ios\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/jonajonlee/flashtalk_ios\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the entire web app using a combination of the IBM Bluemix platform, Node.js, and Watson API.

The primary industry was coal mining and my friends at school didn't think of university education as an option. Too expensive; too hard to get into. </p>\n<p>Some had babies before 18, some fell into drug addiction, most didn't graduate... but what many did were trade apprenticeships. A trade apprenticeship meant they could leave school at 16, start earning some money, and get training to be a qualified construction worker, plumber, electrician and other manual labor roles. In my own case I got lucky by building a popular video game community website when I was 17 which scored me a scholarship at city university. </p>\n<p>In the 21st century the demand for IT talent has rapidly increasing. As our society grows so does our dependence on systems and software to facilitate our daily lives. There are a broad range of IT jobs at all levels that remain unfilled and outsourced and any business can be improved by the smallest amount of IT knowledge. </p>\n<p>We think there should be an IT apprenticeship program that enables kids who come from situations where college/university isn't a viable option.

They would complete 2-4 year training and work program where they would build the skills to work in the IT industry and receive a professional accreditation for.</p>\n<p>It's obvious that kids are into technology; the biggest unicorn tech companies in this country were built off products that targeted young people.

This program has to exist. </p>\n<p>During this hackathon our focus to is get as much validation for the idea as possible.

Only 40% of Oakland's students have computers and Internet at home, even fewer at our school. Everyone has a phone, though. Homework is rarely completed. Students forget what work they have with their busy and stressful lives; how can you remember when you have home, school, and work responsibilities? We know our most affluent peers benefit from tools on the Internet to help them manage their schedules and to learn. We want the same advantages, but recognize that not all of our classmates have computer access at home. To solve this problem, we're using text messages!</p>\n<h2>HW Helper reminds students about their works and utilizes a peer network.</h2>\n<p>Every night, students will receive a text message reminder to check whether or not they've completed their homework. If they have, they have the option to put themselves in a queue to help their peers. If they haven't because they're confused, they can connect with a peer who is able and willing to help them. If they just haven't had the time yet, they can decline the help, but they'll get another reminder in an hour.</p>\n<h2>This app uses node.js and Twilio.</h2>\n<p>We also used Heruko and Google Hangouts along the way.</p>\n<h2>It wasn't always smooth sailing.</h2>\n<p>It took a while to recognize the environment variables that were needed to activate Twilio.

Both of them had the same reasoning - when they look up headlines of American education, the headlines of the great accomplishments are overshadowed by the news of school shootings and other gun violence.</p>\n<p>Whether we want to admit it or not, gun violence has a profoundly negative impact on education, particularly in America.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I personally love guns, and own several.  I went to college in Georgia, where going to the range was a social thing to do.  I'm also HUGE into privacy and civil liberties, and a lot of the proposed legislation to cut down on gun violence attempt to do so at the cost of massive government overreach in both my minds and that of others.</p>\n<p>Because of those reasons, I decided to take on a project to use technology to fix one particularly controversial type of proposed gun control at the moment - universal background checks.  That is to say requiring a background check for all gun purchases, even private ones.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>To understand what the big deal is with this implementation, it's important to look at the concerns that the pro-gun community has.  I have my own thoughts on the matter, but to get more diverse opinions, I reached out on Thursday to The Truth About Guns, one of the largest pro-gun blogs on the internet.  They hosted it Friday as their \"Question of the Day\", and the response was monumental.  For a blog that normally gets 30-40 comments per article, my question received an order of magnitude more feedback <a href=\"currently%20approaching%20300%20comments\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/10/daniel-zimmerman/question-of-the-day-whats-wrong-with-universal-background-checks/</a>.</p>\n<p>Sifting through the comments, it's clear there are a few big trends in the concerns people have:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The fear that, given a collection of guns what guns were transferred to what people, the government can trivially form a \"registry\", or a large list of every gun that everyone owns.  There is a fear that this could lead to confiscation.</li>\n<li>Issues with what a \"transfer\" is defined as.  Nobody wants to do a background check on their son to give them a gun for their birthday, or to not be able to take a friend to the shooting range and let them use your gun without becoming a criminal.</li>\n<li>Needing to go to a gun shop to have a check done is really hard for some people.  Either they live far away, or don't have the free time to do it.</li>\n<li>The fact that some states require you to pay for a check, even if it's for a private transfer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, I set out to (and I feel succeeded in) addressing all of these issues.  Here's how the system works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The user (a person selling a gun to someone) goes to the site.  They are presented with a web form that has multiple sections.  The top section is the buyer information, the next is the seller information, and the last is the firearm information.  The two people fill out the form together, and then, upon hitting submit, the magic happens.</li>\n<li>The data is partitioned in the browser into \"public\" and \"private\" data.  The public data is the information required to do the background check (name &amp; SSN/drivers license of the buyer).  The private data is all other information pertaining to the sale (the seller information, gun serial number, type, etc.)</li>\n<li>The first thing that happens is that an RSA keypair is generated.</li>\n<li>The keypair is used to encrypt all of the private data, and represent it as a base64 string.</li>\n<li>The public data is also stringified and encoded in Base64 to make the next steps easier.</li>\n<li>The keypair is then used to create a CSR - a certificate signing requests.  This is what you make and send to certificate authorities for them to give you a signed certificate for your website.  The public data is stored in the common name field, and the private in the organizational unit (hacky, but works, and those fields aren't really needed for this anyways).</li>\n<li>The browser then uploads ONLY the CSR to the server (the private key that was used to encrypt the private data is never sent).</li>\n<li>The server uses the public, unencrypted data from the CSR to perform the background check on the buyer.  Currently this is just a mock function, but can easily be replaced with the real query if this were to be adopted.</li>\n<li>If the check comes back clean, the server uses a root CA certificate that it maintains to sign the CSR, and returns the signed certificate to the user.</li>\n<li>On successful check, the browser downloads both the signed certificate and the private key to the user's hard drive.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this manner, the certificate can act as a receipt, which can be validated that it was issued by the government using the CA they maintain, if the gun is later used in a crime.  The seller can present the receipt, and it's authenticity can be proven.  And then, using the private key that was generated, the seller can decrypt the private information, and further prove that the check that was conducted did in fact apply to the gun in question.</p>\n<p>All the private information, including the seller, gun serial numbers, and even the number of guns sold is encrypted from the government eyes.  This makes it nearly impossible to form a registry.</p>\n<p>In addition, since all the security code is in the frontend, the site can be audited and monitored by groups like the ACLU to ensure it doesn't change.</p>\n<p>Of course, when it comes to politics, technology can't be a complete solution.  Here is the corresponding legislature that I propose to match this system, to make it effective.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sharply increase penalties for not having a background check done for a private sale, if the gun is used in a crime (perhaps an accomplice charge)</li>\n<li>Do not make the check mandatory, that's unenforceable, and will then lead to the issues around the definition of \"transfer\" and similar complaints</li>\n<li>Allow the check to be on the open internet, so anyone can freely use it.</li>\n<li>Agree to (as the current law states), delete buyer information within 24 hours of a successful check.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With these changes in place, we can hopefully see an actual decrease in illicit gun purchases.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>Super simple (minus the crypto) - it's a javascript frontend, and a Go based backend.  It's really just a web form, so other than getting the cryptography libraries to play nice there wasn't too much to figure out.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Having never done javascript before, I took on some of the weirdest, and quirkiest bits of the language.  File uploads, turning javascript variables into downloadable files entirely in-browser, weird stream objects coming from the fetch API, etc.  It definitely had me, and the mentors, scratching our heads at points.  And it doesn't help that any time you're dealing with cryptography all the error messages are (intentionally) vague.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>It works :)</p>\n<p>It's not much of a looker, being pretty much just a form, but it works!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Javascript is just as god-awful of a language as I remember it being 5 years ago.  I'm going to go back to my server side coding now.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Fixing Firearm Background Checks</h2>\n<p>Publicity and hopefully even legislation changes.  This is a hotly debated topic at the moment, so the former shouldn't be hard.  Getting anyone to actually accept a compromise solution to a controversial problem on the other hand...  I'm ready for the flood of hate mail from both sides.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/go\">go</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cryptography</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/twrobel3/UBC-PoC\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/twrobel3/UBC-PoC\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://privatetransfer.club\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://privatetransfer.club\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>privatetransfer.club</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", [""]], ["Exchangeagram", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h2>Exchangeagram</h2>\n<p>Exchangeagram is a smart automated textbook exchange program aimed at simplifying the textbook exchange process.

Perhaps it is peer pressure or just social anxiety, it stops students and teachers to gauge their performance in the class and learn and grow. How can we make the students' learning more stress free and simultaneously address the issues that come up with teachers/professors' abilities to convey information lucidly? Poll2Roll is the answer!</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Every lecture is divided into several topics. After the teacher completes a topic, students get an option to vote Yes (Understood) or No (Confused) through their smartphones, and add comments. Based on the number of up and downvotes, and a sentiment analysis of the comments, the instructor will get a tactile feedback via the Myo he is wearing on his wrist.The teacher will then re-teach the concept or try to engage people to understand what they found difficult.\nIn the long run, the teacher will have at his disposal a dashboard of graphs to track the performance of students. He can choose to tweak his teaching pace, assignments, and teaching style based on these. </p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>The application had many different components to be considered as it combined the software component of real-time feedback with the hardware tactile feedback. The front end is written in angular.js with ionic and the database system used is Clusterpoint. The script used to control Myo is written in node.js. REST APIs were used for all communication protocols between the client server and the hardware. </p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>Configuring the database with such a huge data set was challenging. It was resolved by cleverly formulating our data structures. Working with HTML/JS to configure web based data visualization and integrating Clusterpoint database management took some efforts since it was a new concept to the team.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>One major milestone that we accomplished was the integration of the sub codes into our final product, the final application. Hardware-software integration (eg. Myo with NodeJS) was established effectively. It was fun and amazing to see how quickly the team was able to pick up new concepts and use them for the development activities.</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Database management without using SQL (via Clusterpoint) , and using without developing a full-fledged back-end system (via BackAnd). </p>\n<h2>What's next for Poll2Roll</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json\">json</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jsfiddle\">jsfiddle</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluemix\">bluemix</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/clusterpoint\">clusterpoint</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/myo\">myo</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/newtonjain/hackingedu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/newtonjain/hackingedu\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", ""]], ["Portable Tutor", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li>\n<div class=\"flex-video\">\n<iframe allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" class=\"video-embed\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"375\" mode=\"transparent\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CALZXL5hxS0?enablejsapi=1&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0&amp;version=3&amp;wmode=transparent\" type=\"text/html\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"615\" wmode=\"transparent\"></iframe>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Portable Tutor \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/310/790/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Portable Tutor \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/310/792/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Portable Tutor \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/311/138/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Living in the bay area, most people here are lucky to live in a place with new technological advancements right at their fingertips. We were able to explore the world and express our creativity using computers and other gadgets ever since we were small children. But our team realized that the whole world does not have same education and access to technology that we have. There are many lower-income families who cannot learn and pursue their interests, even if they really wanted to.That's why we thought a simple website where people can take a few short lessons on what they are interested in for free would give them a kick-start for their pursuit to do what they love in life.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><strong>Portable Tutor</strong> is like a tutor <em>right in your pocket</em>. Upon visiting the website, you can start looking for tutors that will teach you what you want. You can <a href=\"http://s7.postimg.org/x3pfkebq3/picksubj.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">choose a subject</a>, such as Science, Math, or Computer Science, and the website will provide tutors who are available to teach you right now. There will also be more filter options to narrow down your results. Once you choose a tutor, you will be taken to a <strong>\"LiveNotes\"</strong> session page. LiveNotes is a service that lets the actions and explanations of the tutor <a href=\"http://s23.postimg.org/4yu3wfqzv/Live_Notes.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">be viewed in real time by the student</a>. The teacher can write, sketch, and doodle with different colors, and explain the exact questions that the student has, right then and there. After the students have felt they have understood, they can thank the tutor and leave LiveNotes.</p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>For the website, we coded in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. We explored many different CSS styles, and chose the one that looked more organized and was easy on the eyes based on <strong>UX design</strong> concepts. The images and logo were made using <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong>, where we created rounded rectangles, and added drop shadows. We also used <strong>Keynote</strong> to tweak the images. Overall, we tried to go with a simple and minimalist design. We coded the LiveNotes entirely in <strong>Java</strong>. We created two different files, a \"Server\" file and a \"Client\" file, where the server would be the tutor, and the client would be the student. We used networking by making <strong>Socket</strong> and <strong>ServerSocket</strong> objects. Here is an example of the code from the Server side:</p>\n<pre><code>ss = new ServerSocket(7778);\n...\ndos = new DataOutputStream(s.getOutputStream());\n</code></pre>\n<p>We used this to share information like cursor X/Y coordinates and the current color chosen. We used the package <strong>javax.swing</strong> to make the GUI of LiveNotes. <strong>JRadioButton</strong> was used for the buttons that choose the color, and <strong>JPanel</strong> and <strong>JFrame</strong> were used to make the main drawing board and window. <strong>MouseListener</strong> and <strong>MouseMotionListener</strong> were used to track mouse actions. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>We were originally going to have the LiveNotes open up in the browser as a Java applet, but many browsers blocked the applet for security reasons. This forced us to use JFrame to create a stand-alone version of LiveNotes. </p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>\n<p>We are proud of the successful networking of LiveNotes, since the sketches and lines show up at exactly the same positions at the same time, and networking in Java is something we learned entirely during HackingEDU. We are also proud of the professional look and design of the buttons, logos, and titles.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>All of our team members now know basic HTML, since we all worked together to fix problems and errors with the website. We also learned the basics of networking with Java, and got an idea of what goes on behind the scenes whenever we use the internet or play multiplayer games. Overall, we brushed up on all our coding skills, and learned new languages while also discovering new possibilities to the languages we already knew.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Portable Tutor</h2>\n<p>The Portable Tutor we are presenting here is more of a prototype of what this service could actually be. LiveNotes could be vastly improved by implementing <strong>more options for the tutor</strong>, such as an eraser option and change of line thickness, and <strong>more interactivity for the students</strong>, so they could sketch on the drawing pad as well and also send messages back and forth with the tutor. Real tutors could sign up for Portable Tutor and be ready for any questions students have. Portable Tutor could be <em>a place for everybody</em>, whether they are trying to understand a concept from school, or are not able to go to school. Our hopes are that this idea can be used to make sure everybody's dreams for their life can come true and that everybody <strong>gets the education they deserve</strong>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop\">photoshop</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/keynote\">keynote</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sublime-text\">sublime-text</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/eclipse\">eclipse</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/portable-tutor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://tinyurl.com/portable-tutor\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>tinyurl.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NeelZilla/PortableTutor\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NeelZilla/PortableTutor\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/NeelZilla/LiveNotes/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/NeelZilla/LiveNotes/\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["I created the \"LiveNotes\" feature using Java.

This effects their outlook on school and the perspective they have on the education system. Many kids who get bullied in school and don't resolve or get the bullying to stop are less successful, drop out or in some cases take things into their own hands.</p>\n<p>School Climate - A few days ago Secretary Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder announced new guidelines to stop the school to prison pipeline and improve school climate. This critical issue is not just about bullying, but about creating an inclusive school climate where all students can achieve their maximum potential.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>Our teams ideal vision for this project is to be able to create a viable project that I would be able to release to the market at a later time period. There are not many Interfaces on the market like this yet and this could help a lot of students who are going through bullying at school but are worried about reporting it in person. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>OutBully consists of two parts, the mobile iOS app (student side) and the Web platform (administrator side) </p>\n<h2>The user (student) side</h2>\n<p>OutBully is a iOS app, the iOS app is used to submit reports of bullying and is where students can monitor their status of the report they sent in.</p>\n<h2>The Administrator side</h2>\n<p>OutBully is also a web platform for administrators to be able to log in and view the reports that were sent in and update the status weather the report is being investigated or it is still under review.</p>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>OutBully was built with mainly Objective C along with swift for the iOS side. The administrator side and the web platform was built with Node.JS, HTML, CSS and PHP.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I ran into many challenges, the main challenge was finding the best and most efficient way to get a beta version of OutBully show by the end of HackingEDU</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>Essentially what I learned was how to integrate iOS with a web platform and allow the two to communicate back and fourth.</p>\n<h2>What's next for OutBully/OneUp</h2>\n<p>Our next steps are to be able to be able to test a beta version of OutBully in some schools and then launch publicly after that  </p>\n<h2>Target Market</h2>\n<p>OutBully's target market would consist of school's and collages in the United States and Canada</p>\n<h2>The Facts and Research</h2>\n<p>In the United States and Canada, bullying is a major concern especially in junior and high schools. Students who grow up being bulled are less confident, less compelled to make wise choices and in some incidents can even lead to self harm or the student could also become more negative in general. The Bully Box which is the traditional method of reporting bullying has worked in several situations and there have been way more reports of bullying  submitted in schools which have instated the Bully Box. The Bully Box is a box, about the size of a shoe box (maybe slightly larger), that is clearly marked and sits in the main office or guidance office. The idea of the Bully Box is to be able to prevent bullying at a higher level and allow more students who may not feel comfortable with reporting incidents of bullying to allow them to report it. There have also been several articles that have reported on how schools are trying to  instate bullying boxes. </p>\n<p>The quotes below are from teachers and parents at high schools in the United States. </p>\n<p>\u201cMany bullying incidents were largely un-reported, students and families were seeing many more problems than the staff, students may be afraid to tell their teacher or belong to groups that do not express those concerns to a teacher, or have an adult they felt comfortable telling in the building. All of these things led us to decide to create the bully box.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cDavis said Florida law requires that schools provide students a way to anonymously report bullying incidents but leaves the school districts to come up with their own ways of doing so. She realized that Highlands County schools were not addressing that statute requirement, so Lake Placid High School technical class students made the boxes that have been installed in all the schools except two. Davis explained she has not had the chance to meet the principals of the two schools, but the boxes will be soon be put into place. They were getting 70 a day, saying 'I'm being bullied,'\" she said, so Highlands County decided to go with the boxes that allowed the students to report bullying anonymously.\u201d</p>\n<h2>What we believe</h2>\n<p>Our team believes that based on the information that is related to bullying and the installment of a Bully Box that if there was a easier way to report bullying anonymously through a iOS, Android app or a website for everyone in the United States and Canada to report bullying to the schools main office or the administrator then there could be a chance to for a big market reach. If the system was viable and able to reach the mass majority of the market then OutBully could reach a lot of students in need.</p>\n<h2>Competitors</h2>\n<p>Teachers and students in the past have thought of ideas to combat Bullying through a similar way either online or through a app. However the problem that exists is that each school has to develop a platform like a Bully Box and this is inconsistent and unreliable because not every school uses the same method.</p>\n<p>One of the possible computers of this upcoming system would by Brandon Boyton\u2019s BullyBox app. (<a href=\"http://bullyboxreport.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bullyboxreport.com/</a>) However even though his initial intension was good, he has only reached a few schools in only the United States that are shown on the map below. There are around 30,000 public high schools in the United States alone, so even though his company has been able to get a few schools onboard across the United States, he still only has less then 1% of the market. Also his system costs $499 a year which could put many school\u2019s out of reach of his Bully Box system.</p>\n<p>A few other computers would be local anti bullying services but they would not be a major competitor as of right now.</p>\n<h2>Proudly built at HackingEDU in San Mateo California.</h2>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift\">swift</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c\">objective-c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5\">html5</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js\">node.js</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css\">css</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">.club</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LemonaInc/OutBully_Final\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/LemonaInc/OutBully_Final\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.outbully.club\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://www.outbully.club\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>www.outbully.club</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["PebbleDict", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div>\n<h1>PebbleDicT</h1>\n<p>Voice dictionary for Pebble.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c\">c</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python\">python</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript\">javascript</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/dlee28/PebbleDicT\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://github.com/dlee28/PebbleDicT\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>github.com</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["", "", "", ""]], ["Dolby Jaw", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dolby Jaw \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/589/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dolby Jaw \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/592/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Dolby Jaw \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/605/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<p>Dolby Jaw introduces a new way for people to listen to music. You can pause a song by clenching your jaw, and start playing it again by clenching your jaw again. Our desktop app uses Muse, a headband which detects brain signals, to detect when a person clenches his or her jaw. The Muse is connected over Bluetooth to a computer, which is receiving data from the Muse on an OSC server. On the computer, a Java program is running, which plays a Dolby-encoded song and pauses/plays it when your jaw is clenched. Encoding our songs with Dolby helped us a lot, because it equalized the song's bass with the treble, reduced the volume to an optimal amount, and made the listener fully immersed in the song. </p>\n<p>Dolby Jaw makes it more convenient for a person to control their music. Dolby Jaw helps change the way you interact between you and your music. For a long time, the way we play or pause music has been the same - by pressing a button. But what if you could play or pause music in a more intuitive, a more personal, way? This is what Dolby Jaw allows us to accomplish. Dolby Jaw is just the beginning, we believe. In the future, technology like the Muse will better interface with great sound like Dolby, so you will be able to control your music as intuitively as possible. </p>\n<p>Note: Our program has no graphical user interface (GUI). If we had more time, we would surely build a GUI, but getting the Muse to detect jaw clenches and send this information to the computer was a big challenge in itself. Instead, we use a log of whether jaw clenches were detected. Based on that, music is played or paused.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java\">java</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/muse\">muse</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/dolby\">dolby</a></span></li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>", ["", ""]], ["Passifact", "<div class=\"large-9 columns\" id=\"app-details-left\">\n<div id=\"gallery\">\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-options=\"animation_speed:0;slide_number:false;timer:false\" data-orbit=\"true\">\n<li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 1\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/694/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 2\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/696/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 3\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/713/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 4\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/714/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 5\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/715/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 6\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/716/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 7\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/717/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li> <li class=\"text-center\">\n<img alt=\"Passifact \u2013 screenshot 8\" class=\"software_photo_image image-replacement\" src=\"//challengepost-s3-challengepost.netdna-ssl.com/photos/production/software_photos/000/312/718/datas/gallery.jpg\"/>\n<p>\n<i></i>\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul> </div>\n<div>\n<h2>Inspiration</h2>\n<p>I have a lot off things to learn and no time to do it all.

interact and perform work in the virtual office. </p>\n<p>We wanted to bring some of that magic into the classroom.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p><em>Pupil</em> is designed to augment the teacher\u2019s classroom and aims to make the teacher\u2019s life easier in everything s/he does in the classroom. By delegating some for their work to an intelligent bot, teachers would be able to keep the class more attentive and engaged by utilizing realtime feedback tools and analytics. With <em>Pupil</em>, Slack would be the teacher\u2019s top companion while teaching in the classroom.</p>\n<p>Here's the full feature list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/anon [question]</code> Asking questions anonymously to the teacher</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes students get lost during class and they would like to ask a question back to the teacher but they don\u2019t because they are shy or fear being called out for asking a bad question. <em>Pupil</em> solves this by allowing any student to post an anonymous question at anytime. Anonymous questions are sent as private DMs to the teacher for them to address immediately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/randomgroups [size]</code> Automatically create private groups among the students with a predefined size</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s imagine it\u2019s the first day of lecture and everyone in this biology class has already settled into the lecture theater and they\u2019ve logged into our Slack team. The first thing the teacher would like to do for the first class would be to randomly group everyone in class into equal groups of 4s. <em>Pupil</em> provides a convenient method to assign random groupings automatically.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/classfeedback</code> Gathering feedback about the pace and difficulty of the class</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teachers can use this command to quickly check with the class if everyone is following the lecture adaquetly. For example, we are 1 hour into our 2 hour biology lecture right now and the teacher would like to quickly check in with the student to see if they have any quick feedback on the pace of the class. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>/askquestion</code> Launching quick questions to the students with result collation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Pupil</em> can also be used by the teacher to launch really quick polls.

But with several AP and college classes, I found it hard to dedicate an allotted amount of time to studying Spanish. However, I know I am not alone, many juniors at our high school struggle in a foreign language, mainly because it just too much to memorize or they just don't have the time to study it. Since this is a relatively widespread problem in education, Rohan and I sought to solve this in HackingEDU.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>User(User 1) goes on our website, and selects the language he or she wants to practice in and texts his or her friend a message in that language. If he doesn't know how to say it, he can check in the '?' tab, if he just wants to confirm that he is right, the check mark tab will do it for him.</li>\n<li>When the User 1 sends the text, it goes through socket.io to display on the site, and gets sent to the twilio server. Twilio then sends the translated message to the other user(User 2) while maintaining the integrity of the message, but in a language that User 2 understands. </li>\n<li>User 1 will see all the messages that he sends and get in the language that he is practicing in, while User 2 will see all the text messages in a language that he understands (by default english).</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How I built it</h2>\n<p>I used angular.js and several APIs listed below to create a node.js app that is capable of performing this hack. With Twilio we are able to send text messages back and forth, and the project couldn't have been done with out the help of the Twilio API.</p>\n<h2>Challenges I ran into</h2>\n<p>I found Twilio somewhat difficult to get working, but nevertheless I got it. Also, a huge setback was getting parse to work. Another difficulty is that we had so little time.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that I'm proud of</h2>\n<p>The app works!</p>\n<h2>What I learned</h2>\n<p>From a bit of javascript to some new APIs, I found out that Hackathons can be interesting and fun to attend.

We observed the lack of education on these topics for young students in school. Since technology is becoming more and more integrated into our daily lives, we truly believe it is important for these topics to be introduced at an early age to garner interest from the younger generation to help them understand and change the world around them.</p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>We designed an application to work with the real life Thinker Bot. This application serves as a way for students to program the robot and make the arms move. Students can easily click movement buttons, specify the degrees, press play and run the robot in real time. </p>\n<h2>How we built it</h2>\n<p>The actual robot frame was constructed, however not assembled prior to the event. During the event, the robot and all electrical aspects were assembled. Also during the event, our team developed the entire Thinker Bot application. </p>\n<h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>\n<p>The first overall challenge was rapidly building a new android app from scratch. In its component form, the app was somewhat simple to tackle, however assembling the individual components together was a challenge. The hardware side of things also proved to be a challenge.</p>\n<h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of:</h2>\n<p>We are proud of our UI design and how we were able to execute it without any heavy framework. We are also proud of our development time for all of the apps as well as having bug-free code. We are also very proud of our team communication given that we all have never worked with each other before.</p>\n<h2>What we learned</h2>\n<p>We learned that processing is great for rapid android/cross-platform development. We also learned that team communication platforms like Slack are very necessary for smooth development.</p>\n<h2>What's next for Thinker Bot</h2>\n<p>Thinker Bot is an ongoing project, our goal is to see schools purchasing Thinker Bot kits for students to assemble and code upon. Keep in mind that everything you see here today has been assembled and developed in just 36 hours. We believe that we can add many features to the application such as challenges in which the student is challenged in a fun game to execute a certain motion (such as pick up a cup), lesson plans with the robot, as well as a feature in which you can put multiple movements together to form a function. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"\" id=\"built-with\">\n<h2>Built With</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet inline-list\"><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing\">processing</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">ketai</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bluetooth\">bluetooth</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/hardware\">hardware</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag recognized-tag\"><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino\">arduino</a></span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">robot</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">robotics</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">embedded-systems</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">embedded-programming</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">cad</span></li><li><span class=\"cp-tag\">tetrix</span></li></ul>\n</div>\n<nav class=\"app-links section\">\n<h2>Try it out</h2>\n<ul class=\"no-bullet\" data-role=\"software-urls\">\n<li><a href=\"http://shadowbot.website\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"http://shadowbot.website\">\n<i class=\"ss-icon ss-link\"></i>\n<span>shadowbot.website</span>\n</a></li>\n</ul>\n</nav>\n</div>", ["Worked on app documentation and UI elements", "I worked on the front end of the Thinker Bot android app. ", "Worked on back and front end of Android App. Worked on full software for robot hardware.

Managing data across different therapist is often a hassle as well. After the therapy session, the therapist will need to enter the data into a  spreadsheets, which are themselves challenging to manage, aggregate, and analyze once the amount of data grows. We believe we can make things much easier by offering a web-based service that is free for therapist's day-to-day usage. </p>\n<h2>What it does</h2>\n<p>Conduct behavioral trials experiment with clear descriptions.
